104,"00:00:00 hello
00:00:01 today yes yes it's going well if I'm lucky I'm going to
00:00:06 record a video about the climb no
00:00:09 because last time I tried to record it and
00:00:13 well it didn't bother a helicopter there was
00:00:17 a helicopter it was making a lot of noise
00:00:21 and well it distracts me I got distracted I got
00:00:23 distracted a bit and I started  Let's talk about the
00:00:25 helicopter and talk about the Aquino sea
00:00:29 today I'm going to try to talk about
00:00:32 climbing I hope I hope I'm lucky
00:00:35 I hope above all that the sound that the
00:00:38 sound is heard well because it's a
00:00:40 bit windy there's a bit of wind but
00:00:43 well I think  that it's going to be heard well
00:00:47 [Music] well
00:00:51 I'm going to talk about
00:00:53 climbing climbing refers
00:00:56 to climbing walls climbing mountains with your
00:01:01 hands and feet
00:01:04 and there are various types of climbing there are different types of
00:01:07 people who climb walls
00:01:10 big ones who climb mountains do it with
00:01:13 ropes normally if they are not crazy they
00:01:17 do it with a rope with a rope for
00:01:19 safety if they fall because the rope
00:01:22 holds them the rope holds their weight no
00:01:27 but I have never done it
00:01:30 rope climbing has never done
00:01:32 rope climbing outside on a big wall or on
00:01:36 a mountain
00:01:38 the climbing I have done is without a
00:01:41 rope without a rope but a few meters only
00:01:45 like 34 meters
00:01:48 and in a gym in a gym
00:01:50 inside a building in a place  where there are
00:01:53 mats on the floor there are
00:01:56 mats thick mats the floor is
00:01:59 soft he is talking it is not very very
00:02:02 soft and if you fall it doesn't hurt it
00:02:06 doesn't hurt
00:02:07 you can jump you can jump and fall or
00:02:10 fall on your back and it doesn't hurt so it's
00:02:13 very safe  you have to be careful it is
00:02:17 better not to fall on your head but it is quite
00:02:20 safe it is not very dangerous
00:02:23 also because the walls are short they
00:02:26 are three or four meters
00:02:29 and
00:02:32 for now I am not a fan
00:02:35 I have never done it every week
00:02:38 in fact in my life  I've only done it
00:02:41 three times I'd say three
00:02:44 times I've tried doing this kind of
00:02:48 climbing called bull the ring not
00:02:50 this kind of low climbing with
00:02:54 mats underneath it's called bouldering
00:02:56 wunder i believe in spain we say bouldering
00:03:00 and i have tried it three times but the
00:03:03 last time he provided it was two
00:03:06 days ago with my friend david here in hong
00:03:09 kong he goes to elba every week or
00:03:12 twice a week and i went with him with him
00:03:16 and  With more people
00:03:18 he has friends there
00:03:20 and they go and they meet there in the
00:03:23 gym and they chat and while they chat well
00:03:25 they are doing climbs they
00:03:30 don't climb the wall
00:03:32 so I liked it I liked it a lot
00:03:34 we were like 4 hours we were a long
00:03:37 time but hey you're resting  You're
00:03:41 taking a while with people and it's
00:03:43 okay it's fun I
00:03:46 ended up with my fingers very very tired and
00:03:50 still now now it's been
00:03:53 a day and a half my fingers are still
00:03:56 tired my arm my arm is also a
00:03:59 little tired actually
00:04:02 and when I was climbing  also my
00:04:06 fingers get tired right away they get tired and
00:04:10 they can no longer exert force they
00:04:13 can't hold on they can't hold the strong stone
00:04:18 and I feel a little bad I feel weak I do
00:04:21 n't have strength I don't like it  i would like to
00:04:25 go more climb more and have more strength
00:04:28 and be able to have more fun and
00:04:31 do more climbs and have more fun and
00:04:34 now when i go back to bangkok this
00:04:37 week i'll be back with this week i'll
00:04:41 be here in hong kong for only one week
00:04:42 then i'll be back  In a few
00:04:45 days on Thursday Thursday I'm going back to
00:04:48 bangkok and in the bank I'll look for a place
00:04:52 to do climbing I'll look to see if there's
00:04:55 a place nearby a place near my house
00:04:58 where I can go and I'll try I'll try to go
00:05:01 and see if I like it  see if i like it
00:05:04 or see if i do it often because there is
00:05:07 no activity so i do that i
00:05:10 do often that i do every week or
00:05:12 every month in bangkok i have tried various
00:05:15 things i have tried different things
00:05:18 like surfing
00:05:20 so i think  that provides a type a type
00:05:25 of surf that is like a wave as
00:05:27 artificial as a machine a machine
00:05:29 that sprays water maybe I'll come back maybe
00:05:32 I'll go again too but I want to try
00:05:33 climbing climbing helps to get strong
00:05:37 to be strong on  all arms and the
00:05:41 whole body the whole trunk the trunk
00:05:43 you also get strong and it's more
00:05:46 fun it's more fun than
00:05:48 exercising in the room it's more
00:05:51 fun than going for a run no then
00:05:54 when i come back when i come back to bangkok i'll
00:05:55 try i'll try going
00:05:59 and climbing  to do climbing they
00:06:03 use a special type of shoes a type
00:06:06 of shoes that in Spanish or in
00:06:09 Spain
00:06:10 we call cat feet cat feet
00:06:13 are these shoes they are special shoes they
00:06:16 are made of rubber
00:06:19 like rubber or silicone or something like that
00:06:22 They stick a lot, they hook a lot with the
00:06:25 wall and they help a lot.
00:06:39 instead of flats they are a bit like that and it
00:06:42 helps to lean on the
00:06:45 stones on the ledges in the mountains
00:06:49 and they are shoes that squeeze you tight
00:06:52 enough they adjust a lot to the foot so
00:06:55 that it doesn't move so that  the foot does not
00:06:57 move and you can hook it well to the
00:07:01 wall or the rock and well I'll try it I'll
00:07:04 try first I'll try going to the
00:07:07 gym I hope they have shoes of my
00:07:10 size because in many places in Asia
00:07:13 they don't have my size I have a 45 my
00:07:17 foot size  In European size it is 45
00:07:22 and in Asia in many places they don't have
00:07:25 shoes of my size I hope they have
00:07:28 I hope I can rent I can rent climbing
00:07:30 shoes of my size
00:07:33 and if I go two three times and I like it and
00:07:36 I want to go more maybe I bought my
00:07:39 own  shoes clothes I bought my
00:07:42 own climbing shoes I already have
00:07:45 mine and so I can use them wherever I
00:07:47 go when I return to Spain
00:07:49 I can also use them

00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:23 hello hello hello judith how about if well
00:00:30 yes if not  You know, in case you haven't
00:00:32 seen the other video with Judith, Judith
00:00:35 is my cousin, not if you're now in
00:00:39 Barcelona, ​​right? She's living in
00:00:41 Barcelona, ​​very well, and today we're going to talk
00:00:44 about yoga,
00:00:46 a very broad topic, yes, a good yoga topic, it
00:00:50 seems like now.  there are many people
00:00:52 who do yoga yes now if you look on
00:00:56 the internet everyone does yoga it has
00:00:58 become very popular yes and I
00:01:03 am going to confess that I have done very little
00:01:05 yoga
00:01:06 and I think I did it for the first time
00:01:10 last year last year  It was the first time
00:01:12 I did yoga and also because there are a lot of
00:01:17 people there are so many people who do
00:01:20 yoga I got a little angry
00:01:22 doing the same thing that everyone else does,
00:01:26 Judith, when you started doing yoga
00:01:30 I started I think two years ago  or three  years
00:01:35 ago you years also not long ago
00:01:37 a ball a long time ago
00:01:39 when I was younger
00:01:43 I'm young too but when I'm
00:01:45 younger even more I still
00:01:48 did handball
00:01:52 handball handball to the ball to the
00:01:57 goal
00:01:58 then it was the sport I did but
00:02:01 I had a problem in the  knees
00:02:05 and then they told me that I couldn't do
00:02:08 any sport that I had to run
00:02:12 I couldn't and then they told me that I could
00:02:19 swim bike bike also
00:02:23 something other than yoga
00:02:28 so I did a lot of bike
00:02:33 I really like it you still bike
00:02:35 now not
00:02:38 long ago  I don't have a bike
00:02:41 but I'm not going to swim I don't like it very much You
00:02:46 don't like swimming I don't like it I quite like it I do
00:02:49 n't know how to swim but I'm
00:02:53 not good at it no good and I started doing yoga
00:02:57 because they didn't know anything about yoga
00:03:00 and I liked it a lot  The truth is, I
00:03:04 expected it to be a very
00:03:08 relaxed sport for very
00:03:12 calm people, it's worth it for people who
00:03:14 were older, exactly, but when
00:03:18 I started I saw that it wasn't
00:03:21 and that made me happy.  It was a lot because when
00:03:24 I do sports I like to get very tired but I do
00:03:27 n't know if I like to notice that
00:03:31 I'm very tired well that's how you
00:03:34 activate the exact body and also because
00:03:37 you're stronger it's not because you get tired of
00:03:39 course exactly and then well me with
00:03:43 yoga  I didn't expect to
00:03:45 get very tired but I got very tired if I also did the
00:03:49 first time on fire, don't see if it
00:03:53 's horrible in fact with all the
00:03:56 people who have spoken the first time
00:03:58 they have done yoga they have thought about
00:04:01 stopping doing the class yes yes  yes
00:04:09 but well I liked it a lot so I
00:04:12 signed up for a school
00:04:15 the first time I went to try a
00:04:17 school in Barcelona and in a trial class it's
00:04:20 worth a pension well more for everything
00:04:24 free the creative one is free yes to
00:04:28 know if you like it
00:04:31 then I liked it  and I signed up, you sign up, there
00:04:33 's that school, thank you, very good,
00:04:36 I'm not going to another
00:04:50 school.  It's going once a
00:04:52 week every week of the year and free yoga
00:04:56 that's very Spanish
00:05:01 but I didn't do it, it's not worth it, he
00:05:04 's a good person, not because I was
00:05:08 embarrassed, not for anything else,
00:05:11 so I signed up and went for a few
00:05:17 days, I think it was a  month
00:05:21 several times a week and twice a
00:05:23 week a month
00:05:25 bolt I could say every day because you
00:05:28 pay
00:05:30 I think it was 40 euros and I could say
00:05:33 every day well but I couldn't
00:05:37 so I only went for two days
00:05:40 and then it's quite good if  It's
00:05:43 okay two days
00:05:45 could be three but three is better if it
00:05:49 's better than two but well if better than
00:05:52 nothing exactly then what I learned there
00:05:55 is to do the yoga postures well so as
00:06:00 not to hurt myself in the postures the
00:06:02 exact positions are fine because if you
00:06:04 do  badly you can hurt yourself yes yes yes
00:06:07 you can hurt yourself a lot because you are
00:06:10 supporting all the weight of your body for
00:06:13 example in your hands
00:06:15 so you can hurt your
00:06:18 back a lot when I learned does the
00:06:22 postures well without hurting me
00:06:26 I thought I don't pay any more and we still need to
00:06:29 pay, of course, yes, you were from Aysén,
00:06:31 you were Spanish, very mental Spain because I
00:06:36 always did the same routine every day,
00:06:39 the same positions, no, there is no type
00:06:44 of yoga that is always the same circuit, it is
00:06:48 always the same positions  but
00:06:52 I don't like that very much because I
00:06:55 need my head to have to think
00:07:00 a bit because if I don't get bored
00:07:03 then I do a yoga called
00:07:06 vinyasa
00:07:08 which is a little faster joan it is very
00:07:12 fluid all the positions are
00:07:14 not static no  you hold it for a long time the
00:07:17 same position you don't change
00:07:19 position fast enough
00:07:21 so since I want to sweat a lot well
00:07:25 that goes very well
00:07:27 like this and then on the internet on
00:07:33 youtube
00:07:33 I found a girl that I really liked the
00:07:38 front or type of me does the same type  of
00:07:40 yoga
00:07:42 and he explains it very well, very well. I
00:07:45 really liked it because he has classes from
00:07:49 beginners to the first day that he
00:07:52 does yoga, he is very advanced so you
00:07:56 can adapt to the level that  you want
00:07:59 and it has gone very well for me yes and now when
00:08:03 you go to do yoga you do it at home if
00:08:06 you put youtube and exactly and then the
00:08:11 fact in the room I put the mobile on
00:08:14 the nightstand next to the bed
00:08:17 I put my mat on  yoga and I do yoga
00:08:22 there they stretch out you put it on the floor and it's
00:08:28 already in the room here in the
00:08:31 room where you were now not in
00:08:33 another okay
00:08:35 if you have enough space it has room
00:08:37 yes exactly because there isn't much
00:08:39 space here because there are closets in both
00:08:41 on both sides and there isn't much space
00:08:43 to stretch out my arms
00:08:46 but in another so I have more space and
00:08:50 it works very well for me because what
00:08:53 bothered me was leaving the house to do
00:08:57 yoga and coming home takes a long time
00:09:04 and not like that  you waste time you just take
00:09:07 showers and you're home I also
00:09:10 prefer to exercise in my
00:09:12 room
00:09:14 I'm also going to run because I know I
00:09:16 can run and I go running often
00:09:18 but I also want to do something other
00:09:21 than anaerobic exercise.  co
00:09:24 of muscle strength and such and I
00:09:27 do that in the room better than having
00:09:30 to go because I know I know that if I have to
00:09:32 go to the gym and come back
00:09:34 I'm going to go much less sex and yoga I
00:09:39 don't usually do I don't do often I think
00:09:43 that  done about four four times
00:09:47 and the first was last year on the
00:09:49 beach
00:09:51 in Barcelona on the beach there I have a
00:09:55 friend who was a friend of a roommate of
00:09:58 mine there in Barcelona one I lived
00:10:01 together with my roommate and he
00:10:03 met a  girl a girl from estonia
00:10:06 from estonia i
00:10:09 think i was in barcelona a few months ago and
00:10:12 she was there she was in a school she
00:10:14 was learning to be a
00:10:16 yoga teacher to teach
00:10:19 so we did the first session which
00:10:21 was like 40 minutes something like that was
00:10:24 quite long and this  type of
00:10:28 yoga I don't know the name of the type of yoga
00:10:30 that we did but I think it's not
00:10:33 vinyasa it must be another because in this one we
00:10:36 did maintain the same posture for a
00:10:38 long time and in the middle of the
00:10:42 position I thought I was going  to die
00:10:46 and also did there were certain postures
00:10:48 that were repeated many times you did like
00:10:52 this and then again and again and if yes
00:10:55 more than once I thought I was not going to
00:10:58 hold on that I was going to be able to hold on
00:11:00 until the end but of course he doesn't want to  be
00:11:03 the only person to stop sure that
00:11:06 everyone is thinking the same among
00:11:08 all of us we want to stop but none of us
00:11:10 want to be the first the pri general
00:11:12 ken give up daughter then hold on if
00:11:15 you hold on until the end
00:11:18 yes yes I think everyone is
00:11:20 thinking the same
00:11:22 but  well hold on and then at the end of
00:11:25 the class the girl said that this was one
00:11:28 of the easiest classes
00:11:31 that it was not one of the hardest that it was for
00:11:33 beginners of course it is all this type of
00:11:37 yoga all the time repeats the same
00:11:38 sequence but has different levels
00:11:42 bolt so even if it is the same
00:11:44 sequence the postures are adapted to
00:11:47 the word level so of course it would be the
00:11:51 most basic level but for a
00:11:54 beginner it is very hard because you are
00:11:56 alone with the  strength of your body, which at
00:12:00 first is low,
00:12:02 so it's very hard, really, I
00:12:06 did it again, he did yoga again with this girl
00:12:07 on the terrace of my block of flats
00:12:12 where she lived, on the roof, she doesn't work,
00:12:16 upstairs, on top of the building,
00:12:18 we did, we did there and  It's also good, it's
00:12:20 also hard, but after the other
00:12:24 two times I've done it, it's been at
00:12:26 a conference I went to that
00:12:28 offered yoga in the morning,
00:12:31 but it was better, calmer, it was like
00:12:34 15-20 minutes
00:12:36 and it was better, easier, then
00:12:38 relaxing.
00:12:40 I don't know if it was necessarily relaxing
00:12:43 but there were older people, maybe
00:12:46 50-60 years old, they did something a little more
00:12:48 moderate and well, shorter, which
00:12:51 is also easier
00:12:54 and what I have done, but well, I think
00:12:57 that the only thing that has  yoga is the
00:12:59 name of what or why sacred yoga
00:13:06 have you tried it and now that there are two
00:13:12 or more people, no, but at least two
00:13:15 people, you can do positions like this,
00:13:18 a bit as if you were a tightrope walker,
00:13:21 exactly in the ci  rco not tightrope walkers
00:13:25 but I don't know if that is
00:13:28 really based on yoga yoga or it's just
00:13:32 the name I don't know the truth
00:13:34 I've also wondered sometimes because
00:13:36 that is very different
00:13:39 and from my point of view I have no
00:13:42 information  but what I see is not
00:13:45 at all similar to yoga no I don't think it's
00:13:48 not based on the original yoga postures I
00:13:50 wanted more how to do something
00:13:52 that looks beautiful no
00:13:55 and strengthen the body I think because of course
00:13:58 yes both to the person on top
00:14:00 to hold on like the one below you
00:14:02 have to exert strength but I don't think it
00:14:06 's something that has to do with yoga it's
00:14:09 true yes yes yes it's true that
00:14:11 you need some strength well quite a bit of
00:14:14 balance yes and then flexibility a lot of
00:14:18 flexibility yes yes because you have  I have to
00:14:20 raise my legs straight like this
00:14:23 I can't I can't do it
00:14:25 no me so I can why
00:14:29 I went to the doctor it's actually been two
00:14:33 weeks
00:14:34 since I found out you have knees
00:14:38 they are broken on both sides
00:14:44 for  On one side and on the other the serious one because
00:14:47 I have done it a lot as a joke
00:14:50 he told me that I am hyper lax because that
00:14:54 is very good for
00:14:58 circus tightrope walkers for people who are gymnasts it
00:15:02 is very good because it means that the
00:15:05 joints have more mobility
00:15:09 than normal  so that's why my knee
00:15:12 spoke very well and you don't have
00:15:16 problems because I'm hyper lax and yes,
00:15:20 my knees hurt because I'm hyper
00:15:22 lax to the software reason yes then
00:15:25 all my joints hurt a little
00:15:27 because whenever I've done sports they
00:15:31 've been  forced because they without
00:15:33 realizing it I was bending the better
00:15:37 because your body did not limit
00:15:40 the limit very much so they told me that I
00:15:42 have to do a lot of sports to have a
00:15:46 lot of muscle so that the
00:15:49 joints do not have to support
00:15:51 all the weight of my body it is enough  the
00:15:55 muscle yes it is true that if you get
00:15:58 strong if you have a lot of
00:16:00 muscle volume you also have less
00:16:02 flexibility not exactly then I think
00:16:05 that  What matters is that it is not so
00:16:07 flexible and that it is stronger,
00:16:09 okay, okay, well, good luck, I hope that
00:16:12 with yoga you can get more of a good
00:16:15 tea and I already feel stronger when it has been very
00:16:18 good, perfect, it is very good, says I,
00:16:21 I would like  try the tight [ __ ]
00:16:25 I've never tried it no but from the
00:16:29 outside I don't know anything yes it seems
00:16:32 slower to me slow I haven't tried it
00:16:38 yet no I haven't tried it I would like to
00:16:40 I would like to try it of course I mean it's
00:16:43 a slow movement if you consider it as
00:16:46 A martial art is not included as a
00:16:50 martial art but of course you are not really
00:16:52 fighting it is not a movement as fast
00:16:54 as with full or other things but of
00:16:57 course if you compare it with yoga that I
00:16:59 did for a long time it is static well
00:17:02 with tai chi yes  It's more fluid and you
00:17:04 move them all day, well,
00:17:07 but you also have some exhibitions
00:17:10 in which you have to use a lot of force
00:17:13 on your knees.
00:17:15 Perhaps they are basic martial art movements,
00:17:19 but slow, you can't do that. I
00:17:23 think if you go, think  Doing in the body
00:17:26 and balance and such
00:17:29 is interesting well I have no
00:17:31 information to be honest maybe in the future
00:17:35 when I try it I'll make a video about the
00:17:37 works
00:17:40 well thank you very much thank you
00:17:42 for telling us about your experience with yoga
00:17:45 you're welcome I hope you keep doing it  and you
00:17:48 get strong if it's okay well thank you very much you're welcome

168,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about Rigoberta Menchú
00:00:04 and why it is so important for the
00:00:08 rights of the indigenous people of
00:00:10 Latin America'
00:00:14 [Music]
00:00:17 Hello, I think you have probably
00:00:22 heard the name Rigoberta Menchú.
00:00:26 Rigoberta is a woman from Guatemala,
00:00:29 Guatemala here
00:00:32 just below  Mexico and Rigoberta is
00:00:36 a defender, she is an activist, she is a
00:00:40 defender of indigenous rights,
00:00:42 and she did a very
00:00:46 important job denouncing the crimes,
00:00:50 denouncing the abuses of the
00:00:54 Guatemalan army during the Guatemalan civil war,
00:00:57 so the
00:01:00 Guatemalan civil war was a very  long
00:01:03 began in 1960 there have been more
00:01:09 intense stages less intense but it is
00:01:12 considered that it lasted between 1960 and 1996 36
00:01:20 years in total
00:01:22 so Rigoberta was a baby when the
00:01:26 war was born she was born the year before it
00:01:29 began she was born in 1959 she
00:01:35 is the daughter of an indigenous family from  a
00:01:38 mayan family of the mayans in the
00:01:43 mayan civilization was a
00:01:45 pues civilization of what is now southern mexico
00:01:48 and the p  Even further north
00:01:51 in Central America today there are
00:01:54 people who speak Mayan at home who
00:01:57 speak the Mayan language among themselves
00:02:00 so these indigenous people are called
00:02:03 indigenous to the civilizations to the
00:02:07 ethnic groups that lived in the Americas
00:02:11 before the Spanish came before the
00:02:14 for the Europeans to come then
00:02:17 Rigoberta was born into a poor family and
00:02:21 her father was already an activist for the
00:02:25 rights of the indigenous people and many times when she was
00:02:28 little Rigoberta accompanied her
00:02:32 father she went with her father to different
00:02:35 events and protests for the rights of
00:02:38 the indigenous people
00:02:40 then  when rigoberta was little her
00:02:44 mother and one of her brothers
00:02:48 were tortured and killed by the
00:02:52 guatemala army and soon after her
00:02:56 father also died her father died
00:02:59 during protests in the capital of the
00:03:02 country during protests the
00:03:05 protesters
00:03:07 ended up inside the embassy  of Spain
00:03:09 and in the embassy there is a fire
00:03:13 there was a fire it is not very very
00:03:16 clear if it  It was caused by the police from
00:03:20 outside or it was caused by the people
00:03:23 who were inside but in that fire
00:03:26 Rigoberta's father died a few years
00:03:30 later Rigoberta's other brother was
00:03:33 captured by the army he tried to
00:03:36 escape and while he was escaping they
00:03:39 killed him and his other brother too
00:03:42 He also died so well we see that it
00:03:45 is a life
00:03:46 and a life that I think would
00:03:49 motivate would be a very
00:03:53 important reason to motivate Rigoberta to
00:03:56 continue doing her father's work not
00:03:59 after finishing her studies because
00:04:03 Rigoberta dedicated herself to being an activist  Once again,
00:04:07 like his father, he dedicated himself to denouncing
00:04:11 the crimes of the army and
00:04:14 denouncing the human rights
00:04:17 abuses of the government and the Guatemalan army,
00:04:20 these crimes were not all
00:04:23 against the indigenous people, but since they
00:04:27 targeted the
00:04:30 indigenous people of the country especially hard, they affected them
00:04:33 Well, especially and Rigoberta believes that the
00:04:38 poverty and injustices that
00:04:41 indigenous peoples receive
00:04:44 is a  It is a heritage from the Spanish colonial era
00:04:48 that the way in which
00:04:52 land and property was distributed in the
00:04:55 colonial era continues to have effects on
00:04:59 the socioeconomic level of the
00:05:02 wealth or poverty of the indigenous people,
00:05:05 then in 1981, who would have been about 22
00:05:12 years old.  21 or 22 years old
00:05:15 Rigoberta went into exile in Mexico she went to
00:05:18 Mexico she escaped to Mexico she fled Guatemala
00:05:22 and in Mexico she continued her activism
00:05:27 shortly after arriving to wrote a
00:05:31 book or with another person with a
00:05:34 writer well they wrote a book and
00:05:37 from that  This book was published
00:05:41 because his life became very famous because
00:05:44 everything he had suffered became very well known
00:05:47 and thanks to this, many people learned
00:05:51 about the problems that the
00:05:54 indigenous people had and the problems in
00:05:58 Guatemala that were happening in
00:06:01 Guatemala at this time.  moment in 1992 she was the
00:06:07 winner of the nobel peace
00:06:10 prize of the nobel prize yes and a few years later in
00:06:16 1996 which was the last year of the
00:06:20 civil war in guatemala rigoberta tr  He declined in
00:06:24 the peace agreements, he worked to
00:06:27 find some agreements, some
00:06:31 conditions for the end of the
00:06:34 civil war, and after the end of the war he
00:06:37 continued to do activism to try
00:06:42 to get the leaders of Guatemala, the leaders
00:06:46 of the army, that the
00:06:48 war criminals be tried.  tried
00:06:51 for the crimes that
00:06:54 some generals had committed were tried but they
00:06:58 were tried many years later they
00:07:00 were tried in guatemala including
00:07:05 the one who was the president of the government
00:07:07 who had been president of the government
00:07:10 during part of the civil war
00:07:13 called efraín rios montt efraín was
00:07:17 tried and in the case of frank he was
00:07:20 tried for genocide for genocide and
00:07:25 for crimes against human rights
00:07:29 later the trial was canceled and an
00:07:33 attempt was made to try again
00:07:36 but he was already very old and because he was very
00:07:40 old he did not enter the court again  prison
00:07:43 efraín already died already died when he was older and
00:07:47 well many other leaders of the
00:07:50 time also already died  Of
00:07:53 course, many of them were never tried
00:07:56 for their crimes, but Rigoberta continues to
00:08:00 do the
00:08:01 same thing, I continue to do activism for
00:08:04 the rights of indigenous people, for the
00:08:07 rights of minorities, for the
00:08:09 rights of women, and
00:08:13 against inequality, no, and you

157,"00:00:00 Today I am going to explain to you how Mexico
00:00:04 achieved independence from Spain,
00:00:07 how it managed to become independent, it managed to
00:00:11 separate from Spain and how it
00:00:15 is celebrated as it is still celebrated today.
00:00:22 Ah
00:00:24 [Music]
00:00:26 Well, Independence Day is
00:00:30 celebrated on September 16 and is  it celebrates
00:00:35 that
00:00:38 independence is celebrated or is celebrated the beginning of
00:00:41 the war of the war for the
00:00:43 independence of mexico is celebrated and it began on
00:00:47 September 16, 1810 so what happened
00:00:54 this day this day miguel hidalgo miguel
00:00:58 hidalgo and miguel hidalgo was a priest
00:01:01 he was a priest he was a priest in the town of
00:01:04 dolores and miguel hidalgo this day
00:01:09 called the people to revolutionize to start the
00:01:13 war of independence then this
00:01:17 war lasted for years it lasted many years it was
00:01:21 a civil war and it was a
00:01:23 guerrilla war of small attacks  small
00:01:26 battles it was not a very intense war or
00:01:30 of very big battles
00:01:31 and it ended in 1821 yes and in 1821 mexico
00:01:41 got independence but mexico
00:01:44 all  via accepted the king of spain the king
00:01:49 of spain was ferdinand the seventh ferdinand the
00:01:52 seventh ferdinand the seventh had been
00:01:56 thrown out of spain by the french if he was no
00:02:00 longer king of spain because the french
00:02:02 the good government napoleon had
00:02:06 thrown him out of spain but mexico said well
00:02:10 yes yes  that you are going to be our king but
00:02:14 then in 1823 he no longer ceased to be the
00:02:21 king of Mexico because in Mexico it
00:02:24 became a republic it
00:02:27 became a government without a king in a country without a
00:02:30 king then on October 4th of the
00:02:36 following year  from 1800
00:02:38 24 the first constitution of mexico was signed
00:02:42 the federal constitution of the
00:02:45 united mexican states yes yes the usa
00:02:50 like the usa of america are called
00:02:53 united mexican states and still today it
00:02:57 is the official name of mexico is
00:03:00 united mexican states then in
00:03:05 1825 it was the  The first year in which
00:03:10 the independence party was celebrated was
00:03:15 celebrated on September 16.
00:03:18 A party was held for the independence
00:03:22 of Mexico from 1825 then in
00:03:27 the  the following years spain tried to
00:03:31 recover mexico it tried to attack again it
00:03:34 attacked mexico several times it
00:03:38 attacked in several places but it did not
00:03:41 succeed it did not manage to recover
00:03:45 and finally in 1836 spain recognized the
00:03:53 independence of mexico spain accepted it
00:03:55 said ok now you are your own country
00:04:00 so since  This year, Mexico has
00:04:03 changed a lot, there have been changes in
00:04:07 government, different government systems,
00:04:09 there have been several constitutions,
00:04:13 there have been wars, Mexico lost
00:04:16 most of its territory, most
00:04:19 of Mexico is now part of the United States
00:04:24 of America,
00:04:26 so in 1910 the building was built.  angel
00:04:32 the angel is a monument in
00:04:36 mexico city that commemorates
00:04:39 independence celebrates the country's independence
00:04:42 so how is independence celebrated now
00:04:46 what mexicans do now
00:04:49 is on the 15th day of
00:04:54 september each year they make the cry of
00:05:00 pain that  it is the cry of pain it is the
00:05:03 cry of pain commemorates the call of
00:05:06 miguel hidalgo when mig  uel hidalgo
00:05:10 called his parishioners he called the
00:05:14 people who lived in his area he called them
00:05:17 to take up arms and go to war not on

00:05:27 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. at 11

00:01:09 what we are going to need. It will be a
00:01:12 pot,
00:01:13 ok, a pot with a lid, it may not be the
00:01:17 same stage of  the pot but there is
00:01:19 no problem with covering everything well
00:01:21 on this side we have more ingredients
00:01:24 we are going to need a cutting board
00:01:26 we are going to need
00:01:28 a knife it could be a knife like
00:01:31 this one a more professional knife if
00:01:33 you are professional chefs good for
00:01:36 you not me  but I know how to cook Mexican
00:01:39 so we are going to need a
00:01:41 spoon it can be small large
00:01:44 medium metal plastic no ok it has
00:01:47 to be resistant and hard we are also going to use
00:01:51 some tweezers to avoid
00:01:55 burning our hands ok we are going to need
00:01:59 a fork
00:02:02 we are going to use it too  a blender
00:02:07 obviously with the blender machine
00:02:09 ok we are going to use
00:02:13 a small saucepan pan but as well as
00:02:19 for heating it
00:02:21 can be without a lid don't worry we are going
00:02:24 to need water too
00:02:26 I just put a little bit of water because I was not going to
00:02:28 put the drop of water and this  It's
00:02:30 basically
00:02:32 if they're thirsty, they're already drinking water, but
00:02:35 we're going to need water too, okay,
00:02:38 tap or tap water or we can
00:02:41 also  We will use normal water to drink
00:02:45 Let's continue with the ingredients we are going to
00:02:47 need now if we go with the
00:02:49 ingredients ingredients
00:02:51 we are going to need zucchini these
00:02:54 zucchini I don't know where you are from where you
00:02:57 live in which town in which city in which
00:03:00 country but these are the zucchini that
00:03:03 we have in  mexico when i traveled to
00:03:05 brazil they had some
00:03:09 giant pumpkins if you have a
00:03:13 giant pumpkin make it a whole giant pumpkin
00:03:15 that is delicious but these are the
00:03:17 ones we have here so after
00:03:21 we pick that pumpkin
00:03:23 we also have chayote here we are going to
00:03:27 make two versions one  version with
00:03:29 zucchini and another version with chayote
00:03:32 I love both but there are those who
00:03:34 don't eat zucchini and there are those who one
00:03:39 is already very slippery and there vice
00:03:42 comment so we
00:03:45 're going to need tomatoes to make
00:03:47 our sauce they can be bigger they are
00:03:51 smaller  here we call this
00:03:53 tomato in brazil- people
00:03:57 call this tomato and for
00:04:00 we tomatoes are tiny green ones
00:04:02 but this is tomato
00:04:05 how many tomatoes are we going to use here
00:04:07 we are going to use about three only because
00:04:10 we already had a sauce made
00:04:12 but I am going to show you how to
00:04:14 make this wonderful and super
00:04:17 rich sauce ok let's  you need onion it can
00:04:21 be a whole onion or a piece of
00:04:23 onion
00:04:25 here we have only a little piece of
00:04:26 onion but with this it is enough
00:04:29 we are going to use cheese cheese of your
00:04:32 choice if you like
00:04:34 gouda cheese manchego
00:04:40 cheese cheese oaxaca cheese  cheese the cheese that you
00:04:44 like to use because here we have other
00:04:47 myths because this one that this is called
00:04:50 cheese to melt fresh cheese is the one we
00:04:54 have with that is enough the
00:04:56 next thing we are going to use
00:04:58 you can use himalayan salt or
00:05:01 pink salt which is one of  those who are
00:05:03 using a lot now because it is
00:05:05 healthy we are also going to need
00:05:08 grain salt we are going to help to remove it so
00:05:11 that you can see it salt of grain inside  Ormente is
00:05:13 grain salt
00:05:16 and we are also going to use ground black pepper.
00:05:20 This we are going to take out a little plant for
00:05:23 the carnation.
00:05:25 Ground black pepper later,
00:05:30 you can smell it if you want. We are going to use
00:05:32 oregano.
00:05:41 ok
00:05:44 this is a special touch and this is the
00:05:48 secret of the house that later we will see
00:05:50 why
00:05:52 cinnamon we are going to use cinnamon cinnamon and
00:05:55 zucchini and I didn't believe it either my
00:05:59 mom gave me the recipe but they already were
00:06:02 ok
00:06:03 and finally we are going to use the  last
00:06:06 things ingredients all the
00:06:08 ingredients are ready let's go with the utensils
00:06:11 we're going to use soap
00:06:14 and we're going to use sponges so that after a
00:06:19 while and here on this side I have the things
00:06:24 aluminum foil
00:06:28 ok if you have if you don't have nothing happened
00:06:31 but since I'm leaving  to go to a meeting
00:06:33 you have to leave the preparations I have
00:06:36 to leave them warm we are going to use
00:06:38 some glass containers because
00:06:43 since I am going to take them I am going to leave
00:06:45 my pumpkins here and
00:06:47 So I have to heat my chayotes when I
00:06:50 get to my aunt's house and I'm not going to
00:06:52 take something made of plastic.
00:07:04 better take it in a
00:07:07 refractory glass container and you
00:07:09 heat it there and you can also use
00:07:12 these things that are ovenproof to
00:07:15 make recipes
00:07:17 and now we are going to start with the recipe
00:07:20 and the first thing we have to do is
00:07:22 have our pot this pot  I have it
00:07:25 here for several minutes and it has
00:07:28 been here for a long time that we are going to put water in it, it
00:07:30 can be tap water or water in the
00:07:32 tap or it can be water that you consume is
00:07:36 to drink daily I have put
00:07:38 tap water because it boils ok what  What
00:07:41 we want is for this water to start to
00:07:43 boil when it starts to boil we are going to
00:07:46 put our vegetables inside ok
00:07:50 you can put them with this strange little thing
00:07:52 that comes out or you can cut it like
00:07:56 you  You want, I'm going to put them like this
00:07:58 but to avoid burning myself we're going to use
00:08:01 this because if the water jumps it's going to
00:08:02 burn me
00:08:05 so we're going to put them here
00:08:08 we're going to put all of these inside a curious fact
00:08:11 these chayotes take a long time to
00:08:14 cook well so what we want
00:08:16 is  put them in before I already put a
00:08:20 chayote in so that it cooks, king,
00:08:22 look, it's almost there, it's all watered down,
00:08:25 but we're going to put all our
00:08:27 hospitals in here
00:08:29 and we're going to raise the fire a little
00:08:33 if you can see the fire here, we're going to
00:08:34 raise it so that it's  sooner and if we
00:08:37 cover it it will be much
00:08:39 sooner because the heat is concentrated
00:08:41 inside and where our vegetables
00:08:43 are we are going to prepare the
00:08:46 sauce ok guys here we are going to make the
00:08:49 sauce ok we are going to take our
00:08:51 tomatoes ok and  We are going to cut them a
00:08:55 little bit to help the blender
00:08:57 not do all the work. We can
00:09:00 cut them in half. We can cut them in
00:09:02 four or you can put them like this but they
00:09:05 are not too bad.  With the blender, if not,
00:09:08 it won't last long, we're
00:09:11 cutting them here, and as you can see on this side, on this
00:09:14 side, we already have the sauce made, which is the
00:09:17 sauce that we're going to be making,
00:09:18 but I'm going to show you step
00:09:21 by step.  the sauce we are going to take our
00:09:24 blender
00:09:27 and already taking the blender we are going to put
00:09:29 all our tomatoes inside the
00:09:33 blender ok
00:09:35 I do not know how much capacity your
00:09:37 blender has but this is more or less what
00:09:40 we are doing we are going to leave it for
00:09:42 a little side and we are going to also  then
00:09:44 use our piece of onion that
00:09:46 we have here we don't use many onions
00:09:48 and you almost don't like the onion don't
00:09:51 put too much on it we're going to put this
00:09:54 amount of onion ok
00:09:56 ok so we're going to remove this that
00:09:59 I don't like
00:10:02 cut
00:10:04 and you can remove the  bits the
00:10:07 layers of onion and just
00:10:09 place them inside the
00:10:12 container
00:10:14 and well in what this is living
00:10:18 what follows to put in the sauce is water
00:10:20 here we are going to use water that
00:10:22 we drink  We are going to add a bit,
00:10:25 we are not going to add a lot because if
00:10:26 we add a lot it will be very
00:10:28 watery, that is, very watery, we add a
00:10:32 little, I think that with that we already have
00:10:34 enough.
00:10:37 In
00:10:41 the blender we are going to put we are going to
00:10:45 put grain salt ok you can
00:10:48 put Himalayan salt but it will
00:10:51 cost a little more
00:10:52 so the recipe recipe that we have
00:10:55 had from my mother and my grandmother and for
00:10:57 generations they tell us that you have to
00:11:00 use salt  how much salt are we going to use
00:11:02 that is to taste but since here in Mexico
00:11:06 we use salt a lot we are going to put
00:11:07 this in it and we are going to test it to see
00:11:10 how much it lacks we put it here
00:11:15 and now we are going to cover it
00:11:19 and now the time has come to blend ok
00:11:23 we are going to use our blender we
00:11:27 put it in the blender now guys we are going
00:11:30 to start blending but since it sounds
00:11:32 very loud and I don't want to hurt your
00:11:33 ears I'm going to blend it for about 10-15
00:11:36 seconds and after sampling  We have the
00:11:38 result
00:11:40 and
00:11:42 we have already blended our sauce. Look at
00:11:45 the color. You are going to say it does
00:11:48 not look like this color at all. It is a
00:11:51 strawberry choco milk and this is a
00:11:53 Mexican sauce, but you are going to see the technique so
00:11:57 that it stays the same and now we are going.  let's
00:11:59 try this to see if it lacks salt
00:12:03 ok it
00:12:08 's perfect salt was very good for us
00:12:10 if yours has been a little
00:12:13 tasteless you can put a little
00:12:15 more salt more onion but if you look it
00:12:17 's quite a lot of sauce and we only used 3
00:12:20 tomatoes  ok we are going to remove the one here
00:12:22 the next step is to clean our
00:12:25 kitchen space guys here we are going to
00:12:28 take our onion ok what are we going to
00:12:31 do we are going to cut a little bit of
00:12:33 onion ok and when I tell you a little bit
00:12:36 is not a little but it is a little  and
00:12:38 we try to make the
00:12:42 parts of onion that we occupy very thin ok
00:12:44 so we are going to use how many onions
00:12:48 I don't know if you are
00:12:50 onion lovers use a lot of onion if
00:12:52 you think I am cutting in a
00:12:54 shape  wrong and I would have to use my
00:12:56 hand so very well I don't know how to cut
00:12:59 but here I am with you ok I think
00:13:03 we are going to use a little more
00:13:04 because there are many people who are
00:13:06 going to be eating and we are going to use more
00:13:09 since we have our  chopped onion,
00:13:11 as you can see, I'm only using a little bit
00:13:13 because in reality, there were very
00:13:15 few tomatoes, but now what we
00:13:17 're going to need is our little pot, ok, the
00:13:21 little one, we're going to take up the time,
00:13:24 but I forgot to tell you what we're going to
00:13:25 need with a, oil can be used
00:13:29 or you can  be used for 8
00:13:32 I have this coconut oil ok which is
00:13:35 what we are going to be using so
00:13:37 we are going to put it here so that
00:13:40 our onion does not stick to us we are going
00:13:43 to save it and from the table we are going to pass it
00:13:48 here but first we are going to  take it if you
00:13:52 can see my sister is making a
00:13:54 spaghetti here
00:13:55 very good but good right now we
00:13:58 are cooking this we are going to learn
00:14:00 our fire at a medium temperature and
00:14:05 we are going to  leave it for a few seconds
00:14:09 we are going to take our table with the
00:14:11 onion and once our pot is hot we are
00:14:14 going to put it inside the pot you
00:14:17 can listen
00:14:22 to what this onion is here it is
00:14:25 cooking we do not want it burnt ok
00:14:27 so please turn it down to  the
00:14:28 temperature once it is already
00:14:31 cooking and while we are going to check
00:14:34 our vegetables how they are going we are going to
00:14:37 reduce them with a knife or a fork
00:14:40 if they look we are going to use our tongs
00:14:43 so that they realize if it gets in they see it is
00:14:46 like very easy not even  I'm
00:14:48 pushing it and the knife is already being inserted
00:14:50 , which means that they're almost there.
00:14:52 We're going to see our chayote,
00:14:56 too. This day is good,
00:14:59 because I put this chayote in much
00:15:02 earlier, okay, and the other one, the others are
00:15:07 harder, if you look closely.  It costs me a little
00:15:09 more work to get in. You can
00:15:12 remove the skin sooner or later or
00:15:15 leave it with the skin as you wish,
00:15:17 since we have checked our onion and
00:15:21 our grue  Those vegetables, if you can look at
00:15:24 the onion, it's a little
00:15:27 golden, ok, golden, that's that term that
00:15:29 we see there as a little
00:15:33 golden, ok, a little brown, a little
00:15:37 brown,
00:15:38 we're going to take our sauce that we had
00:15:41 mixed with the tomato and the onion and
00:15:44 the salt and we're going to  Let's put it inside this,
00:15:47 guys, because if I put the
00:15:50 sauce in the pan, the hot pan is
00:15:53 going to start to boil and it's going to
00:15:56 be a mess or a mess.
00:16:01 that
00:16:03 we put it quickly carefully
00:16:06 there it is
00:16:09 that we are
00:16:11 going to leave our sauce here that it
00:16:13 boils that it boils that it boils it is
00:16:17 that these little bubbles that we see
00:16:19 here come out ok that the water is already very
00:16:20 hot it reaches a temperature that it
00:16:23 begins to do or be  in a state of
00:16:26 boiling
00:16:28 we are going to take our oregano that we have
00:16:31 lacked in the sauce recipe ok
00:16:33 we are going to take a little how much I don't know if
00:16:37 you like oregano a lot use a lot
00:16:39 if you don't look at it first  We are going to grind with
00:16:42 our hands
00:16:44 and we are going to put it
00:16:47 in our sauce.
00:16:58 boil
00:17:01 our tomatoes and they will start to give
00:17:03 the little color of the other sauce that I
00:17:05 showed you the moment we have been
00:17:08 waiting for our vegetables are now ok
00:17:11 we are going to lower the heat if you want we are going
00:17:12 to in fact we are going to put out the fire
00:17:14 because I eat the water now  It's hot and it's
00:17:17 going to keep heating up my vegetables.
00:17:19 We're going to take out. We're going to start
00:17:22 with the pumpkins first and we're going to leave the
00:17:24 chayotes at the end because I told you that they
00:17:27 're a little tougher. Well, I'm only going
00:17:30 to take one out to give you an example.
00:17:32 What are we going to do? We
00:17:35 have our pumpkin here, we're going to
00:17:37 remove this tip, ok, later
00:17:40 you can eat it if you want, if you don't,
00:17:41 leave it here and we're going to cut our
00:17:45 pumpkin in half
00:17:48 once our  pumpkin is at the
00:17:51 end and broken we are going to remove it if you
00:17:54 want this part here that we see
00:17:56 as a little bolder that is we
00:18:01 remove it our next step will be to
00:18:05 remove all this from here because there is
00:18:08 all this pulp we are going to
00:18:10 remove it with a lot  be careful that they are
00:18:12 not going to break
00:18:14 guys here I am going to give you a super type
00:18:16 ok when you do this it is much
00:18:18 more difficult to get all the pulp out with the
00:18:22 spoon so for that
00:18:24 we also want the simple fork and
00:18:25 simply do this and how do you see it comes out
00:18:29 easily ok and then they just
00:18:32 spoon out the rest what
00:18:34 has
00:18:37 finally come out the moment you have been
00:18:39 waiting for we are going to pray with our sauce
00:18:41 come and see the color of this sauce if
00:18:44 you look it has almost appeared it is
00:18:46 cold nothing more than  that is why it has changed
00:18:47 but it is almost the same we are going to put
00:18:49 our sauce in here ok if you
00:18:53 look closely this also has bits of
00:18:55 onion ok a little bigger but
00:18:58 all good since the  we have emptied it
00:19:00 we grab our famous spoon
00:19:02 we mix a little this smells it does not taste
00:19:06 delicious and now the special secret
00:19:10 we have been waiting for cinnamon
00:19:14 we are going to put cinnamon in our sauce
00:19:18 also cinnamon and cinnamon in our
00:19:23 sauce a few touches of cinnamon 12
00:19:28 34
00:19:31 here we are taking out our  chayotes
00:19:33 for you to see is a little
00:19:35 different the technique ok what you have
00:19:37 to do is cut it here I am
00:19:41 leaving them with the shell because I really like
00:19:42 the shell we are going to cut it
00:19:45 in half
00:19:48 and once it is cut by the
00:19:50 We have half of it this way, ok, it's not the
00:19:54 same with the pumpkins, it's
00:19:56 easy to remove, ok, a little bit, but if you look closely,
00:19:59 almost nothing comes out, it's a little
00:20:01 complicated, ok, everything is also
00:20:03 complicated, which is what I do, I pass
00:20:06 a knife or we can't  chop to the
00:20:09 bottom because if we chop to the bottom
00:20:11 it will break and everything will come out ok
00:20:13 we do it from above
00:20:16 we turn around as if it were an
00:20:18 avocado and what  What happens is that when
00:20:22 we have it ready, well cut and nothing
00:20:25 else with a spoon, we put it in and take it out and
00:20:29 there is a hole left, guys, what we
00:20:31 just did here, look at our
00:20:33 zucchini, some are not perfect,
00:20:35 others broke a little but it's okay,
00:20:37 you can  rescue from this side
00:20:39 we have chayo 3 we have more chayotes and
00:20:42 chayote yes zucchini ok what follows
00:20:45 is that we are going to use our
00:20:47 that we are going to cut it into pieces ok they
00:20:50 can be smaller bigger and
00:20:53 what is next this cheese we are going

159,"00:00:00 I am going to talk to you above all about art and
00:00:03 culture in Spain during that time, it is
00:00:06 what is called the Golden Age
00:00:11 [Music]
00:00:14 because it has been a long time since I recorded a
00:00:18 video on the history of the history of
00:00:21 Spain' sorry I am very sorry I know  You
00:00:24 really like history videos
00:00:27 so I'm going to do more from
00:00:30 now on I promise to keep
00:00:33 making more history videos okay
00:00:36 and in the last video I told you about the
00:00:39 Spanish empire I told you about the conquest
00:00:42 of America especially America  through
00:00:45 Spain'
00:00:46 and today I am going to talk to you about the same period,
00:00:49 the same period of time, the same
00:00:51 centuries, but from another point of view, I
00:00:55 am going to talk about art and
00:00:58 culture in Spain during that period,
00:01:01 during the same period, is what  it is
00:01:03 called the golden century it is called the
00:01:06 golden century and well it is called the golden century
00:01:09 although it is normally considered that it lasted
00:01:13 longer it lasted more than a century it is considered it is
00:01:17 usually considered between 1492 and 1492 it was
00:01:24 the end of the reconquest and it was the
00:01:28 download  covering of america then
00:01:31 the golden age between 1492
00:01:38 650 or sometimes a thousand 681 well there are
00:01:44 different ways to define it this
00:01:47 time considers it coincided more or less
00:01:51 with the dynasty of the habsburgs the
00:01:55 habsburgs were a dynasty of kings a
00:01:58 family of kings and the following video
00:02:02 that  I will make history about these
00:02:05 kings about the Habsburgs and about everything
00:02:09 that happened in Spain in Europe also
00:02:12 during this period during these years
00:02:15 so this period is called the
00:02:18 Golden Age because it is considered that the arts
00:02:22 and culture in Spain at this time
00:02:25 Well, they were very good, it was a
00:02:29 very important time for culture and the
00:02:31 arts, it is considered the most
00:02:34 important time for literature, books,
00:02:37 novels, theater, poetry from Spain,
00:02:43 and that is sometimes considered up to 1,681
00:02:49 because this year was the year  in which
00:02:54 pedro calderón de la barca died pedro
00:02:58 calderón de la barca how good he wrote
00:03:02 theater he wrote poetry then this
00:03:06 time in this time spain  It had a lot of
00:03:11 influence in Europe and art in the
00:03:15 Spanish language also had a lot of
00:03:17 influence in Europe, especially because
00:03:21 at that time Spain had money, it had a
00:03:24 lot of money for all the gold, all the
00:03:28 silver that came from the Americas that
00:03:30 came from the colonies, then this
00:03:34 period.  it is divided into two into two parts
00:03:38 from the point of view of the art of the
00:03:41 arts
00:03:42 and the renaissance
00:03:45 and the baroque
00:03:47 renaissance and baroque and well
00:03:51 aesthetically visually they are very
00:03:54 different the renaissance from the baroque and
00:03:57 this change
00:03:59 this change from renaissance to baroque
00:04:02 a very important reason  it was the
00:04:05 counter-reformation that is the counter-reformation
00:04:09 the counter-reformation was a reaction in
00:04:14 europe a reaction by catholics
00:04:16 by the catholic church and the countries the
00:04:20 governments and the catholic people against the
00:04:23 lutherans against protestantism the
00:04:27 protestants that was another branch of
00:04:31 christianity that appeared in this  time
00:04:34 and the catholic church the vatican did not
00:04:38 make a list well the vatican but in the
00:04:41 In the case of Spain, well, the Catholic
00:04:43 Church of Spain made a list of
00:04:46 all the books that are prohibited
00:04:49 for Catholics that are prohibited for Catholics in
00:04:53 Catholic areas, such as
00:04:56 Spain, in Spain, above all, we were, and
00:05:02 Catholicism continues to be, the greatest religion.  the church made a
00:05:06 list of prohibited books that
00:05:08 could not be read and many were
00:05:11 related to Lutheranism or
00:05:13 Protestantism
00:05:14 so in the baroque religion
00:05:19 began to be more important in art
00:05:21 in the arts in painting in
00:05:24 writing and with that influence of
00:05:28 religion everything becomes darker
00:05:32 more pessimistic and even though the beginning
00:05:36 the renaissance was quite different
00:05:39 in spain the renaissance is more a
00:05:44 tendency to vulgarization to make
00:05:47 everything vulgar to talk about normal people
00:05:50 to talk about everyday
00:05:53 problems problems we have  Well, the people, the
00:05:56 normal people, a tendency towards
00:05:59 realism to make everything more realistic
00:06:02 and also to make fun of  things to
00:06:05 laugh at things about
00:06:08 past ideas about very strict ideas to make fun of to
00:06:13 make satire for example
00:06:16 of knightly novels chivalrous novels
00:06:18 in which the knight with his sword his
00:06:22 shield his spear is a perfect person he
00:06:25 is a very  strong that he is never
00:06:29 wrong or that he has no defect,
00:06:33 no moral defect, he never does
00:06:35 bad things and so on, during the
00:06:38 golden age, if a satire is made, it is
00:06:42 a satire of this of the knights of
00:06:45 the knights of the chivalric novel
00:06:47 and  don quixote is a very clear example no
00:06:51 don quixote is a very clear example of
00:06:53 satire of satire comedy of this
00:06:57 chivalric novel that was the classic it
00:07:00 was what existed before
00:07:02 then in the golden age
00:07:04 it breaks enough with the ideals and with
00:07:08 the dogma  From the Middle Ages of the above,
00:07:11 then some very important artistic forms
00:07:15 of the Golden Age' are the
00:07:18 picaresque novel. The picaresque novel is
00:07:22 very characteristic of the Golden Age' in
00:07:24 Spain.  a what is the picaresque is comedy
00:07:28 are comedy novels in which
00:07:30 normally the protagonist the
00:07:33 most important character is a young person and the
00:07:37 most classic example the best known
00:07:40 is lazarillo de tormes the book of
00:07:43 lazarillo de tormes is not sure
00:07:46 who  he wrote it but it is a very
00:07:49 famous book and they made us read it at
00:07:51 school I had to read it at
00:07:53 school then there is satire satire
00:07:56 is like a critic who
00:08:00 laughs at something usually laughs at something that
00:08:02 existed before and  an example is
00:08:06 don quixote don quixote de la mancha'
00:08:08 'miguel de cervantes' satire can
00:08:11 exist in prose like quixote don
00:08:15 quixote is prose or it is not narrative it is a
00:08:18 book but there is also poetry and
00:08:22 there is also theater or satire in
00:08:26 form of theater and then there is
00:08:29 also comedy simply humor
00:08:33 the most important thing was theater there were
00:08:35 many plays written at this
00:08:38 time that were humorous plays that
00:08:41 were plays well to laugh then
00:08:44 c  Who were the most important poets
00:08:47 of the Golden Age in Spain a very
00:08:52 important poet was Luis de Góngora Luis de
00:08:56 Góngora was good later I'm going to
00:09:00 write it down
00:09:01 Luis de Góngora was a very important poet he
00:09:04 was also a playwright
00:09:07 playwright is a person who writes
00:09:10 theater  who writes plays no
00:09:12 luis de góngora was also a
00:09:15 playwright then francisco quevedo
00:09:19 also a very important poet but who
00:09:22 also wrote novels and also
00:09:25 wrote plays and santa teresa
00:09:29 de jesus santa teresa de jesus' was a
00:09:33 nun wrote poetry especially the
00:09:36 second half of the golden age' during
00:09:40 the baroque this is poetry not theater
00:09:44 playwrights people who wrote
00:09:47 important plays were
00:09:50 tirso de molina tirso de molina is like
00:09:55 a tongue twister the name was
00:09:58 also a poet he also wrote novels and also
00:10:01 wrote theater but hey it's very  It was
00:10:04 very important because of his plays,
00:10:07 there was Pedro Calderón de la Barca, as
00:10:10 I have already told you.  edro calderón de la barca

00:10:18 considered the three great
00:10:20 playwrights of the golden age' pedro

00:10:27 very important play that is to live the
00:10:31 dream and then lope de vega these were

00:10:53 the golden age' and of painters we
00:10:57 have El Greco and we have Diego  Velázquez
00:11:01 and he painted a very famous painting
00:11:04 called Las Meninas

00:11:31 [Music]
00:11:33 since things
00:11:38 then at this time science was
00:11:41 also very important
00:11:43 science in Spain and a lot
00:11:47 apart from Europe was a bit
00:11:49 of a continuation of l  or inherited by the
00:11:52 Arabs of what we knew thanks to
00:11:54 the Arabs, the Arabs taught us a
00:11:57 lot about medicine, mathematics and
00:12:00 other things and at this time, because
00:12:03 this work was continued, it was a very
00:12:06 important time for science
00:12:08 at this time the rae was founded  the rae that
00:12:12 still follows now the royal
00:12:16 spanish academy of the language of the
00:12:19 spanish language that still now makes its
00:12:22 dictionary has the dictionary of the
00:12:24 spanish language and is therefore the
00:12:27 most important organization for
00:12:30 spanish for the spanish language

00:12:35 buildings from this period there are still
00:12:38 buildings now such as the facade of the
00:12:41 University of Salamanca or the Monastery

00:00:31 [Music]

00:00:38 few photos and come on, let's start
00:00:41 this is a photo of me and my wife,
00:00:44 Jim, and we're in Barcelona, ​​and if last year,
00:00:49 2020, we started it in Barcelona
00:00:54 , ​​we started it in  I was at my
00:00:58 mother's house we were at my mother's house in
00:01:00 Spain it was the first time my wife
00:01:03 came with me to Spain and the first time
00:01:07 she went traveling to Europe or traveling
00:01:10 outside of Thailand and Laos
00:01:13 so well it was a trip  very very
00:01:17 special for her and I was also able to
00:01:19 introduce my wife to my family so
00:01:22 well it was a fun trip and we
00:01:26 are here at the end at the end of the image you
00:01:29 can see the arc of triumph which is an area
00:01:32 an area that many people visit in
00:01:35 barcelona is  an important monument of
00:01:38 the city and yes here as you can see
00:01:40 with a jacket and because it was good it's
00:01:43 a little cold it's not very cold but
00:01:46 it can be a little cold in winter
00:01:47 this was our
00:01:51 good party to celebrate that we
00:01:55 had gotten married  legally we were married a
00:01:57 few months before in thailand but
00:02:00 this was the first public thing
00:02:03 we did we had a meal it was not
00:02:06 long many hours but only one
00:02:08 meal you can only invite
00:02:11 family and friends it was not a lot of people in
00:02:14 total i think there were 60 people
00:02:16 then  We had a good,
00:02:19 small party for a wedding, many
00:02:21 people throw bigger parties and well, you see, he

00:02:30 videos I have some videos with my mother
00:02:33 on the channel and well, my  father my
00:02:35 sister to other people but I have
00:02:38 covered their faces because I don't know if they want
00:02:40 their face to be seen in a public video
00:02:43 so well it will be covered but it
00:02:46 was something  We
00:02:47 rent it very much like a little house I think it
00:02:51 was an old warehouse an old
00:02:53 wheat grain warehouse or something
00:02:57 but now they have turned it into an
00:02:59 events room meeting room
00:03:02 we took catering we paid for a catering
00:03:05 for skewers that bring trays with
00:03:07 different skewers  and canapés and such
00:03:09 then it was something very very simple and
00:03:12 this was also that at the beginning of
00:03:14 2020 still during the same the same
00:03:18 stay in spain worth next to
00:03:21 our apartment shortly after returning to
00:03:25 thailand from spain we bought the apartment
00:03:28 and this this is the room  This is
00:03:31 this room, this is what I have
00:03:33 now turned into a studio. As
00:03:35 you can see, the walls were cream-colored,
00:03:38 like a cream-colored color, and I have
00:03:41 painted them all. The bed is no longer there, this
00:03:43 mirror that you see is no longer there.
00:03:46 I have changed the curtains  the table from ikea chair and
00:03:48 the white square table from ikea are
00:03:51 still there, there isn't one yet
00:03:53 but everything else is very different
00:03:56 I covered the floor with carpet  with a
00:03:58 few squares of carpet then good
00:04:02 but this is if this is the flat when
00:04:05 we came to see it the first time we
00:04:07 came to see it before buying it and well it
00:04:10 's my first flat it's the first time he
00:04:12 bought a flat he had never bought a
00:04:15 flat  or a house and now let's see now

00:04:20 time to see how many years it takes us
00:04:23 to pay for the apartment that we will
00:04:25 be back in Spain the most because we will be

00:04:35 we went to Spain a second time in 2020
00:04:38 and you will think Pablo you are rich you have a lot of
00:04:41 money to travel no the truth is that
00:04:44 we ended up with quite little money
00:04:46 after having to go to Spain a second time
00:04:49 now  I'll explain why but
00:04:51 these are my mother's noodles it's my mother's
00:04:54 noodle stew which
00:04:58 is very tasty and if you watch the
00:05:01 private videos you already know that I don't usually eat
00:05:03 meat but if I go to someone's house  And the
00:05:07 food they have includes meat, well, of course,
00:05:09 I'm not going to tell the
00:05:13 person who is inviting me to their house,
00:05:14 I don't want to eat this, then, and
00:05:17 this, well, when I was little I ate it a lot and
00:05:19 I liked it, I really liked
00:05:21 those noodles.  You can see that it has
00:05:23 carrots, it has peas, it has
00:05:26 red pepper but it is not spicy, ours is not
00:05:28 spicy. In Spain, normally the food is
00:05:30 not not spicy and it has veal, and
00:05:33 it is very good, and here, well, also
00:05:35 walking around around from, well,
00:05:40 close to where  it lives in me where
00:05:42 my mother lives not far away you can go for a
00:05:45 walk in the countryside and such and see the countryside
00:05:47 so I'm going to explain why I
00:05:49 was in Spain I went to Spain for an
00:05:52 operation so you can operate on me in the
00:05:54 hospital and
00:05:56 you see  the private videos if you are
00:05:59 subscribed in homeland to see the
00:06:02 private videos you will already know you will know
00:06:05 why I went to have an operation on
00:06:08 my head they opened my head and they
00:06:10 operated on my brain so you want to know
00:06:13 why  And what was the result? Well, I
00:06:17 leave you the link below to sign up for the
00:06:19 pattern, but hey, we continue. I have more more
00:06:22 photos, but hey, we took this photo
00:06:24 because it was a beautiful place with
00:06:27 these, which are flowers. I don't know if they are
00:06:30 flowers or like fluff.  they leave
00:06:33 the plants and we went for a walk
00:06:36 around well near my
00:06:39 mother's house and if my mother doesn't live in the country
00:06:42 it's not in the country it's in a city
00:06:44 but well it's not very far from
00:06:47 areas and fields and  forest and such that more
00:06:51 during this it was her after the
00:06:55 operation after the operation on
00:06:57 my head that's why I wear the hat I wear
00:06:59 the hat so that the sun does not
00:07:02 hit the wound and it was a few days after
00:07:06 the operation when I already  I was feeling
00:07:08 better now I could walk well and such and
00:07:11 we went where we went to Sant Antoni
00:07:14 I think this was Sant Antoni de Calonge
00:07:16 which is on the Costa Brava the Costa
00:07:19 Brava is the northern half of the
00:07:22 Catalonian coast in the Mediterranean Sea
00:07:25 and we went here with with  jim my wife  and with
00:07:29 my mother and yes we spent a few days at the
00:07:33 beach and we had a good time
00:07:37 back in thailand back in bangkok i
00:07:39 took this photo because i was surprised i was
00:07:42 quite surprised when we were in
00:07:44 spain. the covite lackovic as they say in
00:07:48 the news
00:07:48 lakovic was  It was getting worse, more people
00:07:51 were getting it, no, but here in
00:07:54 Thailand there had been zero cases for
00:07:57 months for several months with zero cases, but
00:08:00 we arrived in Thailand and everyone was
00:08:02 still wearing masks,
00:08:05 everyone was wearing masks, and I thought, oh my gosh
00:08:07 , they take it very seriously
00:08:09 and there are people responsible.  more people here with
00:08:11 masks with zero cases of kobe than
00:08:13 in spain where in spain' there well I
00:08:16 don't remember but like ten thousand a day
00:08:19 or so and I was surprised so I took
00:08:22 a picture this is the skytrain it's the train
00:08:25 it's not a monorail  but it is
00:08:27 an elevated train an elevated train that there are a couple
00:08:30 of lines through bangkok a
00:08:32 sunset a sunset in bangkok many
00:08:34 times the sunsets are beautiful
00:08:37 and  n in bangkok because there are not many
00:08:40 days when all the sky is clear
00:08:42 so many times there are clouds where
00:08:45 the sun reflects and it looks beautiful and secondly
00:08:47 I think it is pollution
00:08:50 air pollution I think it makes
00:08:52 this contrast of  blue and
00:08:55 red colors and such makes it look more
00:08:57 beautiful of course
00:08:59 pollution is bad air pollution is
00:09:01 bad for the lungs but
00:09:04 many sunsets are beautiful
00:09:06 this was good visiting this I already made
00:09:10 a video visiting this  temple but
00:09:12 hey temple
00:09:13 this is
00:09:15 a park a theme park that you go to and
00:09:18 you can see buildings that have been
00:09:20 built just for you to visit it's not
00:09:22 a real temple but hey it's very
00:09:25 pretty and it will be there because it's pretty it
00:09:27 's a place where you can see  photos of
00:09:31 thailand of beautiful places many times they
00:09:33 put this photo and this is the
00:09:35 huge city the ancient city that is
00:09:38 in this near bank you can go with
00:09:41 the skytrain with the train
00:09:42 the elevated train can be  It can go very
00:09:44 easily this is that it's a crab I
00:09:49 don't know if you see it if you see the crab but it
00:09:51 's here it's tiny and this is its nest it
00:09:54 's the hole where it
00:09:57 hides and all this around are
00:10:00 little sand balls that it has been taking out  that he
00:10:03 is taking out and he made me
00:10:06 thank you very much we saw this on
00:10:09 the beach on which beach would he say it was a
00:10:12 thing he would tell me they were a thing mind we went
00:10:14 to the beach here in thailand and on the
00:10:16 beach there were thousands of crabs
00:10:19 small crabs like
00:10:21 there were  if that is very small it was like that more
00:10:24 or less wide something like that and there were
00:10:26 thousands of crabs and when you
00:10:28 walk you get closer the crabs
00:10:31 all go into their hole and
00:10:34 hide and it was very very funny and well
00:10:38 I always like to go  to go to the sea to go to the beach
00:10:40 and I wanted to remember that moment and this is
00:10:43 also a thing for me it is on the same
00:10:45 beach that there was a swing my wife
00:10:47 was swinging I know here that it is a
00:10:49 place a beach also very very beautiful
00:10:52 you see how green there are not  much more
00:10:55 vegetation and large trees and much
00:10:58 greener than in my area
00:11:00 of ​​spain than
00:11:03 in the mediterranean area in the mediterranean area
00:11:04 yes there are plants but they are usually
00:11:07 shrubs or lower vegetation or there are
00:11:10 trees but there are trees  with
00:11:13 tougher leaves with leaves with perhaps a
00:11:16 darker green color that better withstand the
00:11:18 cold of winter while in
00:11:20 Thailand there is a lot of water, a lot of
00:11:23 humidity
00:11:24 so the vegetation
00:11:26 is very, very leafy and well,
00:11:29 this photo seemed pretty to me, this is also  In Cosa
00:11:32 Met
00:11:32 this is a statue that there is when you
00:11:35 arrive at the port of Cosa Meta there is a
00:11:37 statue of a demon, a demon that I
00:11:40 don't know if it was, I don't know if it's a mermaid, also if it
00:11:42 has a fish tail, I don't remember,
00:11:45 but well, here it is.  You see, it's a female demon,
00:11:47 as it can be seen clearly, and my
00:11:50 wife finds it funny, these,
00:11:52 these statues, not where you can see, you can see the
00:11:56 breasts or you can see the ass, you can see
00:11:59 the statue's penis and it makes it funny  and they
00:12:03 wanted to take a photo at the statue
00:12:05 and I think that's it I think this is the
00:12:07 last one well in the end even though we are
00:12:10 in Thailand and it has been a better year
00:12:13 than in other places than in other
00:12:15 countries regarding the cob and also  even
00:12:19 so, there is a certain level of being
00:12:22 careful and such and we also had a
00:12:26 reason to save money that I think I
00:12:28 will explain to you shortly and
00:12:31 we didn't do many
00:12:32 but well yes, two trips to Spain and
00:12:35 then we have moved around here a bit
00:12:38 in thailand and well I know what it is I don't know
00:12:41 when you will be seeing this yes it will be
00:12:44 May or June it will seem a little late
00:12:46 for me to explain what I did
00:12:49 in 2020 but well maybe next year
00:12:51 I will do it sooner I will give myself more  hurry up
00:12:54 and I'll show you I don't know if I will because
00:12:56 this 2021 it may be even worse that
00:12:59 we go to fewer places due to the
00:13:02 Lakovic issue that is now getting worse it
00:13:04 's getting worse in Thailand but
00:13:07 well we'll see see you in the
00:13:09 next video I reckon  If you want to
00:13:11 know more, you want to see more videos
00:13:15 about these things, why did I return to
00:13:18 Spain, what was the result of the
00:13:21 operation?
00:13:30 only 7 dollars a month
00:13:34 you will have more
00:13:35 than a thousand private videos that you can see and
00:13:39 we make two new videos every day they
00:13:42 are all intermediate or advanced level this
00:13:45 only if you are already at the
00:13:48 intermediate level or higher ok come on bye
00:13:57 ah
00:13:59 [Music]
",3
195,"00:00:00 In the previous video I explained to you that
00:00:04 María Cristina the regent, the
00:00:08 queen's mother, and I went to France and the
00:00:12 dictator Espartero also fled, he went to
00:00:17 London, to England, and when she was only
00:00:21 13 years old, Elizabeth the second
00:00:26 became Queen of  Spain Let's
00:00:30 see if Isabella managed to stabilize the government
00:00:33 of Spain
00:00:43 so in
00:00:47 1844 the reign of Isabella
00:00:50 Segunda began and the moderate decade from
00:00:55 1844 to
00:00:58 1854 began, ten years a decade, it was not the
00:01:02 moderate decade if you remember,
00:01:05 the Carlists were there.  The most
00:01:08 traditionalists were the most conservative
00:01:11 but they lost the war and at this
00:01:13 time in the government there were
00:01:16 moderates and liberals the moderates
00:01:19 being the most conservative in
00:01:23 government and these were ten years in
00:01:26 which they were in government the first
00:01:29 moderate was  narváez narváez was the
00:01:33 first leader of the moderate government he was a
00:01:36 military man he was also a military man and he
00:01:39 had already fought against
00:01:41 espartero co  ntra espartero who ended up
00:01:44 going to london so the queen
00:01:47 supported this government well when
00:01:50 the queen started she was 13 years old I don't know
00:01:52 to what extent she knew nothing about the
00:01:55 government but apparently the queen
00:01:58 supported this government she
00:02:01 supported narváez and this  government makes a new
00:02:04 constitution the constitution the
00:02:06 constitution of
00:02:09 1845 is a light constitution it is not a
00:02:13 revolutionary constitution or very innovative or anything
00:02:16 so this constitution and this
00:02:19 government defends the creation of a
00:02:22 centralized state a uniform state to which
00:02:26 all of spain' is directed to be controlled
00:02:29 in  the treasury is updated in the same way with the same system
00:02:31 the treasury is
00:02:34 the ministry of spain that collects
00:02:37 taxes that collects taxes
00:02:40 gets money so that the government
00:02:41 has money and updates the electoral system they
00:02:45 update the voting
00:02:48 in fact they make them stricter if already
00:02:51 in  At that time many people could not
00:02:53 vote
00:02:54 there are many conditions to be able to
00:02:57 vote  Well, they make it even stricter,
00:03:00 even fewer people could vote and
00:03:02 during these 10 years the Liberals have been kept
00:03:06 out of power, the Liberals
00:03:09 had no power in the government during
00:03:12 this time, so at this time,
00:03:14 Isabel Segunda when she was 16 years old, not a
00:03:18 few more years.  Late at the age of 16,
00:03:21 Isabella marries her cousin if they marry
00:03:25 Francisco de Asís Francisco de Asís here
00:03:28 Francisco de Asís was 24 years old and
00:03:32 that was his cousin.
00:03:37 At that time their
00:03:40 age difference was quite large and their
00:03:42 marriage did not go very well they had
00:03:45 many problems in addition to the
00:03:47 age difference it is said that Francisco was
00:03:50 homosexual he was gay but even so
00:03:53 they had 12 children they had here 12 12
00:03:57 children 12 12 children although many
00:04:01 many died when they were
00:04:03 still small and well because of this
00:04:05 marriage this union began the second
00:04:09 carlist war why because the carlists did not
00:04:13 want that is  abel to marry
00:04:15 francisco de asís they wanted her to
00:04:19 marry the son of carlos the son of carlos
00:04:21 who was also isabel's
00:04:24 second cousin but the liberals didn't
00:04:27 want the king to be a carlist they didn't want it
00:04:30 and they started a war a war that lasted
00:04:33 three  years the second carlist war
00:04:35 lasted three years and again the carlist
00:04:39 lost again it ended in
00:04:43 1849 the carlist lost and
00:04:47 won well the liberals won
00:04:49 relatively more liberal than the
00:04:51 carlist the government of spain won not
00:04:54 then during these three years during
00:04:56 this war the  government approved the
00:05:00 concordat of the holy see the holy
00:05:03 see is the vatican
00:05:05 the father of the vatican of the catholic church they
00:05:07 made a concordat they made
00:05:11 a treaty with the government of spain' the
00:05:14 government agreed to give money to the
00:05:16 church to pay part of the
00:05:19 country's taxes  I would give them to the church and
00:05:22 also the Catholic church
00:05:25 would control the schools it would have control over the
00:05:28 schools in Spain then after  After the
00:05:32 end of the war, the
00:05:34 railway was built, lines
00:05:38 were built, tracks were built, not many
00:05:41 railway lines in Spain, but it was found
00:05:44 that the government, well, there was corruption in
00:05:47 the government and in
00:05:49 the railway construction contracts
00:05:51 there had been a lot of construction, a lot of corruption.
00:05:54 a lot of people who had taken money
00:05:57 then in
00:06:00 1854 the army rebelled against the
00:06:03 government the revolution of the vikalvarrada took place the revolution of the
00:06:09 vikalvarrada took place already in
00:06:11 1854 well that the army rebelled
00:06:14 against the government then here
00:06:17 the moderate decade ends and begins  The
00:06:21 progressive biennium from
00:06:25 1854 to
00:06:28 1856 is two years, two years, that's why it's a
00:06:33 good me. The progressive biennium, the
00:06:35 government changed, stopped being moderate and
00:06:38 became more progressive, so
00:06:41 within this revolution of the
00:06:43 Vikalvarrada, there was General O'Donnell,
00:06:46 the General.  o'donnell does not have a Spanish name,
00:06:48 I don't know why, maybe his parents
00:06:51 were from outside our country, for sure
00:06:53 but well in this revolution o donnell
00:06:55 fights against the government and gets
00:06:58 the government to sign an agreement and this
00:07:01 agreement asks the government to make
00:07:03 reforms to make progressive changes
00:07:06 so a lot of people supported
00:07:09 o'donnell supported o'donnell right
00:07:12 now isabel segunda  he tries to control the
00:07:15 situation a bit and brings
00:07:18 back espartero espartero the former
00:07:22 progressive soldier who had to go to
00:07:25 london well isabel brings him back and
00:07:28 puts espartero puts espartero as
00:07:32 head of government and Mr. these
00:07:35 soldiers don't play don't play  at
00:07:37 baseball puts o'donnell as minister
00:07:39 of war as the leader of the army of
00:07:43 spain then news comes out that
00:07:46 the government is going to make a treaty with
00:07:49 great britain with the government of great
00:07:51 britain of the united kingdom is going to make a
00:07:53 treaty that will  to harm
00:07:56 the trade the trade of barcelona the
00:07:59 trade of castilla of the castilla
00:08:03 the castillas various regions of spain
00:08:06 would be harmed
00:08:08 So when it comes to buying and selling, then in
00:08:11 Barcelona and in Castilla there are riots, the
00:08:14 people riot and well, there is a crisis
00:08:17 in the government
00:08:19 and Espartero Limited is part of the game.
00:08:21 Espartero is going to like to leave. Well, he
00:08:25 is not leaving this time  abroad but he resigns
00:08:27 and ceases to be the leader of the government
00:08:30 then the liberal union from
00:08:36 1856 to
00:08:39 1863
00:08:41 well here the good I liberal ends and
00:08:44 the government of the liberal union begins
00:08:47 so in this period that happens when
00:08:50 espartero resigns espartero says I no longer
00:08:54 i want to work here and the queen puts
00:08:57 o'donnell puts o donnell in
00:09:00 power but o donnell is only
00:09:03 in power for three months because he doesn't get
00:09:06 along with the queen they don't think the same
00:09:09 way o donnell and the queen then the
00:09:12 queen tries two different moderate governments do
00:09:16 n't work either no
00:09:18 elections and people vote for o'donnell
00:09:22 so o'donnell will last
00:09:25 four and a half years this time four and a half years
00:09:28 in power this time  It was a
00:09:31 fairly long period and that is why the government is called
00:09:33 long if you imagine four
00:09:37 and a half years then at this time the
00:09:39 economy of Spain improved the
00:09:42 economy rose what happens that the government of
00:09:45 O'Donnell began to bill itself to
00:09:48 fracture it began to have problems no
00:09:51 there was a single ideology in his government
00:09:54 there was not an idea a thought a
00:09:58 line of thought that united
00:10:00 people but more than anything else people
00:10:03 united because of the person of o'donnell because of the
00:10:06 character and when people started to
00:10:10 disagree  agreement on the specific ideas
00:10:13 that they were going to apply because the government
00:10:16 broke up or donnell was in a position
00:10:19 in which he did not have enough people to
00:10:22 support him he could not govern and o'donnell
00:10:24 also resigned he also said this
00:10:28 cannot be fixed I am leaving then
00:10:31 In 1863 and
00:10:38 1868, in 1863 and 1868, and this time is called the final crisis,
00:10:42 which happened at this time, the
00:10:45 moderates made various attempts to
00:10:48 convince the liberals to form
00:10:50 part of a government that  they accept a
00:10:52 government that is designed for
00:10:55 them to lose so they never
00:10:57 have power and then the liberals get
00:11:00 more and more discontented
00:11:03 and less and less happy with that
00:11:06 situation and there comes a point where the
00:11:09 liberals are so tired of the
00:11:12 try to deceive with benghazi we are going to
00:11:15 do this but not really
00:11:18 you really have no way to win in the
00:11:20 end they get tired that they no longer want to
00:11:23 accept anything unless they order
00:11:25 that they can directly govern they
00:11:28 can make decisions
00:11:30 directly then to avoid this
00:11:33 so that the liberals do not take power,
00:11:36 a dictatorship begins, the
00:11:40 narváez dictatorship then begins the dictatorship of
00:11:43 narváez narváez is much more the ex-
00:11:46 strict no longer tries to reconcile with the
00:11:50 liberals does not try to concede anything to the
00:11:53 liberals and gets the liberals and
00:11:57 the progressives still  adopt
00:12:00 more extreme positions become even
00:12:02 more radicalized then again there was
00:12:05 an uprising h  There were protests and it ended
00:12:09 in the glorious revolution in

",3
161,"00:00:00 hello guys how are you once again your
00:00:02 mexicana here talking to you
00:00:05 today we have a new video today
00:00:08 we are going to do something completely
00:00:10 different from what we are used to
00:00:12 I am not going to talk about my life well
00:00:16 maybe some things will come out but really
00:00:18 today  We are going to do makeup, we are going to
00:00:29 characterize a character, I am going to
00:00:32 tell you a little about how when we are
00:00:35 doing theater, actors, actresses,
00:00:40 people who are in theater, we usually put
00:00:42 on makeup a lot in any
00:00:45 presentation, or at least when the director
00:00:47 asks us not to put on makeup, we do
00:00:49 makeup, but sometimes  Sometimes you have to
00:00:51 characterize a character, which
00:00:54 means that we are going to give him something that
00:00:59 cannot be seen. Today we are going to have a
00:01:03 characterization, that is, I am going to
00:01:07 become someone and I decided to give them
00:01:11 a characterization that they think
00:01:15 they have never seen me like that and well, that  It's the
00:01:17 first time, so I'm not wearing anything, nothing
00:01:19 on my face, I'm like this, with nothing, with
00:01:22 nothing, because today I'm going to characterize myself
00:01:26 wisely.
00:01:29 Grandma's flowers that's how it is then look, we're going to
00:01:33 start so that it's not too much trouble
00:01:34 because I'm going to try to make it as
00:01:37 fast as possible but
00:01:38 makeup always takes a little bit of
00:01:40 time so the first thing we're going to
00:01:42 do if you're a woman and  Well, you have
00:01:44 hair to hold or if you are a man and
00:01:48 you have long hair
00:01:49 we are going to take our hair we are going to
00:01:51 do what can be done okay so
00:01:54 that our hair will not bother us
00:01:56 while we are doing our makeup this
00:02:00 is new I have already done
00:02:02 this makeup many times  It's been a long time
00:02:06 since I got on as a granny in
00:02:08 a theater on a stage but I
00:02:11 love playing the character and in the end
00:02:14 we're going to try to play an
00:02:16 old woman ok so we're going to start with
00:02:19 the first thing if you guys though I have the
00:02:22 face completely and without makeup washed
00:02:24 without anything like this we are going to use
00:02:28 our face in this way we are going to
00:02:30 try to make it as easy
00:02:34 as possible because we are not going to make it very professional
00:02:37 v  We are going to make it easy, simple and
00:02:39 make it look very fun, very cool and
00:02:42 I think it is also Halloween, but if you
00:02:44 want to have some option or if you
00:02:48 just want to have fun and do
00:02:50 something different, we are going to do this. I hope
00:02:52 it turns out better for you than I am.  to do
00:02:54 my best, it's been a long time
00:02:56 since I've done makeup characterizing
00:02:58 characters, but I like it a lot and well,
00:03:02 let's start first of all, if
00:03:05 you have glasses, we're going to remove them, it's the
00:03:07 first time you've seen me without glasses, I don't
00:03:09 know, but well, and without anything  You're welcome, so
00:03:12 what confidence do I have in the first
00:03:15 thing we're going to do is this is what they're called and well,
00:03:18 we're going to use these correctors this
00:03:21 is a color I don't know if you can see it
00:03:23 if it looks like that how focused I
00:03:26 don't have glasses I don't see  nothing
00:03:28 but I'm going to do my best
00:03:30 so it's hard for me to put on makeup without
00:03:32 glasses or if I have my glasses it's like
00:03:34 going to the mirror I have a mirror here I
00:03:36 'm going to try to make it look on
00:03:39 camera but in some  Things I'm going to be
00:03:41 turning the mirror over okay so the
00:03:43 first thing we're going to do we're going to do
00:03:44 a face correction which means that
00:03:47 the contour of our face has
00:03:50 maybe your face is a little
00:03:52 thinner I have it in the shape of an
00:03:55 oval  or in the shape of a circle, not
00:03:58 as much as a circle, but a little more
00:04:00 elongated, you know, but neither elongated,
00:04:02 thin, it's like elongated, chubby, so
00:04:05 what we are going to do is first draw
00:04:07 a circle in our head, I don't know if you
00:04:10 can see it, tell me why I
00:04:13 am  half that I don't see we are going to draw a
00:04:16 circle this is normally done when
00:04:19 they are doing makeup but I
00:04:22 like to do it we always draw a
00:04:24 circle on two sides
00:04:29 I don't know if you can see here you can see it
00:04:30 then we are drawing a circle on the
00:04:33 whole face and  what are we going to do
00:04:35 fill these spaces not much ok
00:04:37 we are going to try to fill these
00:04:39 spaces also in the lower part
00:04:44 everywhere ok this is what we have to
00:04:46 do very carefully the c  The smell will
00:04:48 depend on the color of your skin. I am very
00:04:50 fair so it really has to be
00:04:52 something clear and with a sponge we are going to
00:04:55 blend up here
00:04:58 this makes us have a contour
00:05:00 around our face ok
00:05:03 sorry I look so we
00:05:06 use a word  who is called
00:05:08 emaciated as if terribly tired,
00:05:13 that is, but as a tired tired woman
00:05:19 who did a lot to do a lot
00:05:22 of housework well
00:05:24 here we have this first step which
00:05:28 is the easiest if you don't want to
00:05:29 do it don't do it but I always
00:05:31 I like to do it and well, we are already
00:05:33 doing it. The next thing we are going to do,
00:05:36 see my eyebrows. See my eyebrows here.
00:05:40 Everyone has different eyebrows. What we are
00:05:42 going to do now is with a white concealer.
00:05:44 This was a slightly darker concealer,
00:05:46 without being so white, but
00:05:50 We are going to use this white a lot I hope
00:05:53 you have it if you don't have it try to
00:05:55 do it with
00:05:57 white makeup face paint but we are going to do it
00:06:00 with this one that we are going to  we are going to do we are going to
00:06:02 cover our eyebrows
00:06:05 even if you think it is a lot it is not much
00:06:07 everything is fine we are going to cover our
00:06:09 eyebrows everything is going to start to look a
00:06:11 little funny a lot and in the end they are
00:06:15 going to know me as an old woman
00:06:18 this is the theater and well  I like it a
00:06:20 lot so we are going to do this we are going
00:06:23 to cover our eyebrows and with our
00:06:26 sponge we are going to try to blend a
00:06:29 little bit ok blend is how you can
00:06:35 make it look not so heavy that it
00:06:38 spreads a little bit of the color
00:06:41 I know it looks bad now  but it will look
00:06:44 better it will look better ok
00:06:45 let's try to blur well the truth is
00:06:47 that since I can't see that's why I wear glasses
00:06:50 I need how to do granny vision
00:06:53 because my little eyes sometimes see well
00:06:57 sometimes not so much but hey guys well
00:07:01 I'm very confident and I hope
00:07:04 Have fun too and learn a lot with
00:07:06 this once our little sponge was more or
00:07:09 less doing this,
00:07:12 half white, right, well, we'll fix it right now,
00:07:16 we're going to do it as we're
00:07:19 supposed to  We want it, we're going to want it, it's the
00:07:22 little white things that come out. My first
00:07:25 gray hair came out when I was nine years old,
00:07:28 so I must be around 23,
00:07:31 I don't know, but well, what are we going to do?
00:07:34 These are going to be final details, but
00:07:36 we're going to  go putting it so you can see
00:07:37 that the hair has to be white
00:07:39 so we're going to put a little bit here
00:07:43 not all the hair ok if you want to put it
00:07:46 on all of it well here's to you but we're going to
00:07:48 try to do this it won't
00:07:50 hurt your hair  Everything is fine if you
00:07:53 pay attention, we are looking a little
00:07:55 older and we have to do this, blend it, we
00:07:59 have to blend it with our
00:08:03 sponge, ok,
00:08:05 the good nuns because they don't
00:08:07 hurt your face if it doesn't help you, ok, if it does
00:08:10 n't, it will scrape you and you will stay  all
00:08:12 irritated all irritated you're not going to like
00:08:15 putting on make-up again
00:08:17 how confident that they see me like this very
00:08:21 confident well then we're here
00:08:24 if you notice I have some strange medium dark circles
00:08:26 here we are going to cover them with a
00:08:28 little bit of white too  Also below I
00:08:31 have to tell you that there are many ways to
00:08:32 do old lady makeup but this
00:08:34 has always worked for me I have always
00:08:36 liked it and when I was at
00:08:39 school many years ago I became
00:08:43 several old lady characters they were my
00:08:45 favorites but hey there it is  We already have
00:08:49 later we are going to put a little more in
00:08:51 the hair but this time that I played the
00:08:55 character of an old woman I put on a wig,
00:08:58 something fake, fake hair and I filled it
00:09:01 with white baby powder, it
00:09:04 was very difficult to transform that wig,
00:09:08 but that hair  false but I did it well
00:09:12 guys now that we are like this this is the
00:09:14 funniest part that we are going to
00:09:16 start to see each other as old people so
00:09:18 what are we going to do we are going to start
00:09:19 from the neck up, do you
00:09:21 think so I don't know  look so drastic and
00:09:23 see the change what we are going to
00:09:26 do
00:09:27 is that all of us have bones
00:09:29 and we have wrinkles and some pieces of skin
00:09:33 what we are going to do is mark these
00:09:36 and I will  Let's see the mirror but hey,
00:09:37 what we are going to do is mark ourselves
00:09:40 if they notice, for example, the bones
00:09:45 with I am using a brown color
00:09:47 depending on your skin, ok, maybe if
00:09:51 you are not, if you are dark-haired or dark-haired, you can
00:09:55 use coffee to  The best is a darker one,
00:09:56 not so light. My skin is going to
00:09:59 show this immediately, but since
00:10:02 there are a lot of people in the theater, what
00:10:06 we need is for the people in the
00:10:08 back to see us if I put on a
00:10:11 line like that, that line and you the  sale, you
00:10:16 know, imagine the spectator or the
00:10:19 person who is at the back of the theater
00:10:21 will not see you, so they have to be
00:10:23 very heavy make-up and that they are very noticeable.
00:10:32 to be at the back
00:10:36 the person who is behind the
00:10:38 theater is going to say wow he looks super cool
00:10:40 but when you get closer to the actor
00:10:42 he will always look like they are looking at me
00:10:44 well guys so what are we going to do
00:10:46 we have to wrinkle  ar and find those
00:10:48 small spaces where we feel that
00:10:51 we have
00:10:54 holes or things like that right now it looks like this we are
00:10:57 going to change it what we are going to do
00:10:59 here
00:10:59 we are going to tighten the neck
00:11:03 and we are going to trace all those little pieces
00:11:07 those folds of those places
00:11:10 where your  nerves your veins we are going to
00:11:12 trace everything and outline everything ok let me
00:11:16 concentrate because if I don't concentrate it wo
00:11:18 n't come out so I'm going to do it I'm going to
00:11:20 turn to the mirror because I can't see and here
00:11:22 on camera I can barely see so better here
00:11:25 they will see me from the side but  It's fine
00:11:27 and right now I can't talk because I have
00:11:29 to do this so excuse me but
00:11:32 go
00:11:40 ahead and do it, look at all sides of his neck, not just in front,
00:11:43 ok, I know it looks kind of ugly, what
00:11:46 are you doing, but it doesn't matter, they're going to see
00:11:48 what  it will look good if the
00:11:51 men have one we have the men
00:11:54 have something here called an
00:11:56 apple we call it the apple
00:11:58 which is a little ball they have here  in the
00:11:59 throat here and here in the throat
00:12:02 try to mark the right one on the
00:12:05 outside sides because that is where
00:12:07 older people also get wrinkles,
00:12:09 which later are really wrinkles,
00:12:12 no, and there are people who wrinkle like
00:12:15 that on their side  you know well this looks kind of
00:12:20 weird but it will remain it will
00:12:21 always remain remember that it must
00:12:23 have a sharpness your pencil must have a sharpness ok
00:12:27 don't leave it all there without a
00:12:30 sharpening point we are going to sharpen it we are going to sharpen it with
00:12:33 a sharpener
00:12:35 and throw this away now  the tip fell off
00:12:37 let me work, that's it, the tip is ready,
00:12:40 let's go on with this,
00:12:43 we already did a little bit of the neck after a while,
00:12:45 we're going to give it a little more
00:12:46 perfection and we're going to do, you know I
00:12:49 'm going to put on my glasses, it's not that  If I
00:12:51 put on the glasses I'm going to look like an old woman
00:12:53 or a granny. Now, if we
00:12:55 do, I'll try to do my best.
00:12:57 What are we going to do? We're going to do
00:12:59 the same thing we did with the neck, but
00:13:00 now in this part here,  We have to
00:13:03 mark all those lines here here
00:13:06 here we have to mark
00:13:10 all those lines here you have to be a little
00:13:12 mouth I call it the baby mouth
00:13:14 that is like that
00:13:17 and we do all those lines ok I'm going to
00:13:19 look weird but this is what it is
00:13:21 what to do ok
00:13:24 we also mark the dark circles because
00:13:26 as we grow our
00:13:28 skin dangles and we need to
00:13:32 have our dark circles not
00:13:35 if you look here we have some lines
00:13:39 uh huh
00:13:42 everyone has different skin and
00:13:44 everyone will have one less wrinkle
00:13:46 one more mark  one mark less
00:13:50 we call this part crow's foot
00:13:52 that's
00:13:56 good let me see myself in the mirror because if
00:13:58 not
00:14:00 it won't stay look also in this
00:14:02 part here
00:14:04 we produce we say produce the lord
00:14:06 and it's this part here
00:14:09 this here the forehead of  well I look
00:14:13 half ra the truth but that's how it is that's how the
00:14:16 forehead is higher up you have to play well
00:14:19 well the face remember not to do this
00:14:22 daily because if you don't it will stay
00:14:24 forever not forever but your
00:14:27 The body gets used to wrinkling the skin
00:14:30 and it is wrinkling no ok if you look closely this
00:14:35 is more or less I look like the witch from
00:14:37 Snow White well we are also going to make
00:14:41 these lines that we have here they are rivers
00:14:45 we are going to smile
00:14:48 these lines we are going to try to mark
00:14:51 what  It is the nose here so that a
00:14:54 little depth can be seen
00:14:57 and we go down here they are rivers
00:15:02 we are going to smile also on the sides of
00:15:05 our mouth
00:15:09 there are people like me who have a little
00:15:11 eye here and this must
00:15:14 also be marked because it is a characteristic of
00:15:16 my old woman
00:15:18 not much just like that ok why see
00:15:20 when I smile hello ok it's starting to
00:15:26 appear yes a bit they are seeing themselves
00:15:28 age in a few minutes but
00:15:31 hey also these lines here
00:15:35 and now we are going to make our little
00:15:38 baby mouth
00:15:40 and we are going to mark all the lines  What
00:15:43 we have here is already running out of
00:15:46 point, we are going to sharpen it, this is
00:15:49 very important because if not, the lines
00:15:51 will be fat, ugly and very frowned upon, you
00:15:53 have to remove them.  arle punta if you get
00:15:56 to see exaggerated that's the theater that's the way it is
00:15:59 then don't worry about it everything is
00:16:03 fine everything controlled
00:16:07 we can even mark the lips a
00:16:09 little so that they are a little more
00:16:11 wrinkled things in mexico we have
00:16:15 some people who dance and who  They
00:16:18 dress as old men, of course, they use an
00:16:20 old man's mask, they just dance with
00:16:23 the cane, it's very, very entertaining,
00:16:26 well, we're going to continue here,
00:16:30 we have to find all the
00:16:32 wrinkles, try to make more wrinkles with
00:16:35 ourselves, and thus give it a
00:16:37 little more
00:16:39 mustiness.  our character ok look at
00:16:44 this side
00:16:46 the truth is that I need to see myself because
00:16:48 so in the camera I don't see anything very good
00:16:52 very good there goes our character in the
00:16:56 forehead I think we are almost
00:16:59 complete but as it is looking good
00:17:02 bad that we need more here  not like
00:17:06 it's very clear there this is
00:17:07 itching the tip is medium
00:17:10 medium rare let's sharpen it again
00:17:15 you have to be very very see with
00:17:18 Be careful with this because if you don't, you can
00:17:20 also hurt them, of course, if you
00:17:22 are professional makeup artists
00:17:24 and you are seeing this, greetings, greetings,
00:17:28 greetings,
00:17:33 and I never took it. Well, I did take
00:17:36 makeup classes because theater needs a
00:17:38 lot, but just like you say that
00:17:42 professional that  I try professionally
00:17:45 but I will never compete against a
00:17:47 person who studied makeup, not like
00:17:51 I am studying nutrition, but I
00:17:53 will never compete against a person who
00:17:55 knows I don't know what a doctor is who studied
00:17:59 for many years and knows more about
00:18:01 conditions like diabetes like
00:18:04 diseases  more serious, you know, you know
00:18:07 what I mean, well, I hope that if
00:18:10 we are here now we are going to also
00:18:13 do the line that is here because
00:18:15 when we are older,
00:18:19 our eyelids start to droop, falling
00:18:23 to gravity down into the earth, it already hurts
00:18:26 me  stinging this it's a little
00:18:30 dark around here I don't know if you
00:18:32 send me or I'm too blind not to
00:18:34 see me I know the j  uro that is difficult we
00:18:38 wrinkle our nose and we are missing
00:18:42 all the marks of the nose look
00:18:44 carefully
00:18:46 we are going to wrinkle our face we are going to
00:18:49 frown is how to do this and
00:18:54 we are going to give ok
00:18:56 to all that line that we see we are going to give it
00:18:59 that it comes never know  you imagined seeing me like this
00:19:02 so now enjoy it I repeat since we
00:19:05 are all different we are all going to have
00:19:07 lines and things in different places
00:19:09 so it's fine ok it
00:19:11 's fine
00:19:12 ok don't worry if they are very
00:19:16 marked or very little the best thing is that they
00:19:18 are very well marked at least  in
00:19:21 theaters and we need very
00:19:23 marked lines because later when we are
00:19:27 doing plays or in full
00:19:29 performance the actors tend to sweat
00:19:32 so it's complicated it's complicated
00:19:36 guys after our makeup falls off
00:19:37 as we sweat it
00:19:40 starts to fall off and things like that  that we have
00:19:43 to be very very careful with that
00:19:46 where they think I'm missing is strange
00:19:49 here is that I have lines here but
00:19:51 not here anymore well we are going to mark
00:19:54 Here, like this, we are going to make a cheekbone here, that is,
00:19:58 when we are older, this starts to
00:20:01 droop, this dangles like this,
00:20:04 so what we are going to do is
00:20:06 make a line here like a little
00:20:09 circle, look how it goes from here from the
00:20:11 nose to the top
00:20:15 .  I'm going to see the nose because if it's not
00:20:17 going to go wrong the nose is going to go down in this
00:20:21 line that we did and here we're going to
00:20:25 raise it see we're going to raise it here
00:20:28 I don't know if they realized more or less
00:20:31 how it is if it's very marked it doesn't
00:20:33 happen  nothing to see the difference when
00:20:36 the skin falls off and here I am still here I look like
00:20:39 a person about I don't know how many years old
00:20:42 here he looks younger not
00:20:44 because his cheek has not yet fallen off well here we are we
00:20:47 do this to see if they come out the same since
00:20:51 they don't  I see
00:20:53 nothing here here our cheeks fall off
00:20:57 and it goes up it has to go up to the ear
00:21:00 come see how far it goes up not here it has
00:21:04 to go up here to your ear and if you have just
00:21:06 realized that I have small ears
00:21:08 yes I have small ears big eyes
00:21:11 big lips maybe i o  Very
00:21:14 big eyes again I am tall but I have
00:21:17 small ears for good the end of
00:21:20 energy anyway in the cinema I would take you into
00:21:23 account here we have a lady a
00:21:26 granny more granny because
00:21:28 the lady's cheeks have fallen off and we are going
00:21:31 to do
00:21:32 look  We are going to re-emphasize these
00:21:34 that we need a little bit,
00:21:38 especially here, look at these bones.
00:21:43 I forgot the name of what we
00:21:47 call clavicles.
00:21:57 Older people,
00:21:59 if you look at the majority of people who
00:22:02 are a little bigger and
00:22:05 have the best of being a little
00:22:06 overweight, so you don't notice it, but
00:22:09 really thin people or
00:22:10 the elderly or grandparents, their
00:22:13 bones and bones are very noticeable.  the neck yes
00:22:15 then well we already have here we are going to
00:22:18 do everything a little faster everything
00:22:20 but really what they have to do
00:22:22 is this
00:22:23 ok this is the longest
00:22:26 and well now  For the only thing we can do
00:22:28 is ours, what can we call
00:22:32 our characteristics as
00:22:35 old women, for example, I have a mole here,
00:22:38 but in the theater the person from the
00:22:40 back of the theater will not be able to
00:22:42 see me, so we are going to mark them a
00:22:44 little more  strong against seeing because it
00:22:46 has a point
00:22:48 we are going to score a little harder
00:22:49 all of that we can invent moles I
00:22:52 don't know I want to we are going to do not a mole
00:22:54 here
00:22:56 there it is I have a mole look at me we are going to
00:22:59 make my moon from here like the one from
00:23:02 darling is up right up  On the
00:23:06 lip, well, we already made one here or is it
00:23:09 a wart?
00:23:22 It seems it's my little eye
00:23:27 where else we can get
00:23:29 enough of a wart for the lady but
00:23:32 remember to always mark this line
00:23:34 well I don't know if it's well
00:23:36 marked by  that I can't see if the
00:23:37 lenses again I tell you but but well
00:23:41 and that the eye bag also falls
00:23:45 we lower a little also under the eye
00:23:48 and well guys you can see this
00:23:51 if you think you are missing
00:23:52 somewhere else keep doing it  until, well, they
00:23:57 already knew that everything is fine, fine,
00:23:59 the next thing they have to do is
00:24:01 now they are going to pass the white corrector over very gently
00:24:04 , which is on
00:24:07 top, well, okay, well, they can pass the
00:24:10 white concealer with little traces or dots.
00:24:13 so in line also
00:24:16 nothing happens
00:24:18 you have to pass it you have to pass it on this
00:24:21 side we are going to pass it from above above
00:24:27 here
00:24:29 you have to pass it everywhere
00:24:33 if we pass it through all the lines we
00:24:36 did most of the lines
00:24:38 below the eye
00:24:40 ok it doesn't matter that everything goes
00:24:44 wrong but let's try to get them close to
00:24:47 our brown color I think I need a
00:24:50 little more here no good now what are we going
00:24:52 to do let's grab our sponge
00:24:54 and see  We are going to do nothing more than a few
00:24:57 not very strong touches because if we do not we are going to
00:25:00 fade and remove all the color that
00:25:03 we have, it will meanwhile then this that you give
00:25:06 me states or the video ok or do you want to
00:25:10 listen to me talk if true very good
00:25:13 well then we do this  we have to
00:25:15 be very careful that our colors don't
00:25:18 fade away we're going to pull from here up
00:25:20 from here up from here up we pull
00:25:25 everything
00:25:26 well well well the nose we're careful
00:25:31 the truth is that it looks a little
00:25:32 stained but they'll see right now what we
00:25:34 're going to do  give another touch with our
00:25:38 color whatever brown color well we lacked here
00:25:42 we are going to give it here well everywhere
00:25:46 guys we have to give it everywhere ok
00:25:49 now once our face is a
00:25:51 little whiter and so strange we are going
00:25:53 to talk to him again with our  brown color
00:25:55 but a little faster because
00:25:57 we already know where our brown lines are
00:26:01 and we will give it a little faster
00:26:05 there are some that are going to be erasing
00:26:07 it does not matter we are going to give it  above
00:26:10 remember to wrinkle your face frown
00:26:15 and produce sorry frown
00:26:17 our wart you can make a few lines
00:26:21 here slightly time is perfect
00:26:26 here we mark well that it is seen that it is a
00:26:29 bag a bag that we dropped and
00:26:33 our our dream these lines come
00:26:36 yes  They don't have a very good point, it's going to
00:26:39 be very ugly.
00:26:54 I don't
00:26:55 want to make it very long but this is more or less
00:26:57 the basis of how they should
00:26:59 do it more or less what are we going to do
00:27:02 for the last detail or last details
00:27:04 we are going to take our
00:27:06 white concealer and we are going to give them a little
00:27:09 more gray hair  not because they didn't
00:27:11 see each other much but now I have to
00:27:14 tell you that after this I'm going to
00:27:16 take a bath because
00:27:17 I have to tell you that one day I went out like this I
00:27:20 painted a little bit  or better
00:27:23 because at that time I saw a little
00:27:25 better but made up like that as an old woman
00:27:28 I went out with a wig, that is, fake hair
00:27:31 and I was dressed as an old woman and I
00:27:34 went out like that to buy some things in
00:27:37 the corner stores I went with my
00:27:39 car and  everything and I was doing a
00:27:41 character now yes I left
00:27:43 saying Andrea I didn't leave being Andrea
00:27:46 the old woman I went down to buy my things and
00:27:50 obviously she came out like that old woman and
00:27:52 spoke like an old woman very cool let's see if
00:27:54 one day I leave like this yes  You want it
00:27:57 only if you ask for it I'm going to the
00:27:59 street I recorded my person on the street I put on my
00:28:03 makeup as an old woman I also
00:28:06 dressed as an old woman you don't think that's anything
00:28:08 else like that I went with a girl's boy's
00:28:12 clothes no no I didn't go  very well
00:28:17 dressed as an old woman with a skirt and
00:28:20 a little bag with a jaguar print
00:28:24 something like that would be very very real I put on a few
00:28:27 extra kilos and some things up here a
00:28:31 little bigger and people
00:28:34 stared at me as an old man like that
00:28:36 now from there  Now it's because I want to connect it
00:28:39 was a lot of fun guys and one day is a
00:28:42 day they want to and they ask me of course yes and
00:28:44 with all pleasure just ask me
00:28:46 because if you don't like the idea then
00:28:49 we continue doing makeup at home
00:28:52 absolutely nothing happens  Well,
00:28:55 we already did this, see the hair a little
00:28:57 more realistic, of course, if we wanted
00:28:59 this painted, well, we would also put ourselves
00:29:02 here, you know, the old woman I don't know what hairstyle they
00:29:05 want for the old woman, a bun, not a
00:29:08 bun, is what they use, I think that
00:29:09 the old women don't  We are going to do this, we are going
00:29:13 to loose it, it seems loose to you, an
00:29:17 old rebellious woman like that rocker, no, so
00:29:21 we are going to put them here, be careful, otherwise
00:29:23 it will break
00:29:25 and then I will not be able to put on makeup anymore,
00:29:27 I have to bathe, come because they can see what
00:29:31 What am I doing for you guys?
00:29:33 Well, I hope your makeup looks
00:29:37 prettier since you can see and
00:29:39 appreciate things in
00:29:42 front of the camera or in front of your mirror, but
00:29:45 here I am doing it  Half blind
00:29:46 when I put on my makeup I put on my
00:29:48 glasses I put on my makeup if I have to put
00:29:50 on my eye makeup I put it like that the
00:29:52 lens is weird but well here we
00:29:56 are now we are perfect my hair looks a little
00:30:00 better no let's see if it doesn't look
00:30:02 very difficult on me  to take this off but
00:30:05 well it's fine it's fine because it's a
00:30:09 young oak tree that dyed her hair
00:30:11 [Music]
00:30:13 ok yes no
00:30:17 if I stay no it just looks like
00:30:20 we still have back here but well that's
00:30:22 not visible anymore we already have too much white in
00:30:24 our hair
00:30:26 I'm going to leave it like this so that it's a
00:30:28 rock granny, give it all a
00:30:31 good, good, what we're going to do
00:30:33 now is simply grab a
00:30:35 reddish color, a red color or a not-so-red color, we
00:30:42 're going to use our brush, ok, what are
00:30:45 we going to do?
00:30:47 come on here we are going to put this color here as if it
00:30:50 were a little more of another color I
00:30:53 am not putting on makeup the old lady is not doing makeup
00:30:54 but sometimes older people
00:30:57 have these parts of another
00:30:59 color yes as I told you  at first a
00:31:03 little emaciated emaciated we are going to
00:31:05 put ourselves a little on the eyebrow down
00:31:10 here ok down here down here down well
00:31:15 you realize the color the tone the
00:31:18 tonality that it gives is different it is not
00:31:22 worth something like that now if you want to
00:31:25 emphasize  a little more for theater
00:31:28 as she doesn't see very well but for theater
00:31:30 I would do it much more markedly because
00:31:32 when I'm far away the person
00:31:34 may not see me so well without having ok
00:31:37 what are we going to do we want our
00:31:39 old lady with the eyelashes a  a little
00:31:43 designated, we are going to show each other our
00:31:45 eyelashes and if you are a man, then no, but
00:31:47 if you look, it changes, it changes
00:31:58 a bit, but well, let's suppose that our old lady is medium modern, medium rare, well, a little, just a little bit because
00:32:02 my little eyes are already tired and what can we
00:32:05 do about it?  It's better to paint our
00:32:07 old lady's lips a little color, you can
00:32:10 see that they like it. Sometimes I'm
00:32:13 putting on a little purple-pink color, not
00:32:16 so much because they don't really paint themselves much.
00:32:19 or there is a little bit of red left but we
00:32:22 fix it quickly and quickly
00:32:24 with a little bit of white powder that is not
00:32:28 white as flesh-colored and
00:32:31 is not
00:32:33 in this one and we give a final touch it
00:32:37 is with powder it
00:32:40 is powder as well as powder we are finished
00:32:44 if they sting they were removing  some
00:32:46 things or maybe it's because I feel
00:32:48 half blind but it doesn't matter now let's go
00:32:51 now with the final character
00:32:54 I would have made it a little more
00:32:56 marked as I told you but it didn't turn out so
00:32:58 bad in fact this line was kind of
00:33:00 weird not like  good dog it's fine now
00:33:05 we're going to put on the glasses I don't know if
00:33:07 I have glasses around here as well as more
00:33:09 of an old lady but I think I don't think I
00:33:12 'm going to have to put on the glasses that I was
00:33:13 wearing
00:33:14 they don't know they're not right let's
00:33:18 put on these glasses  We are going to do the
00:33:20 interpretation oh look I can see myself now
00:33:23 I look high which is not bad
00:33:25 it turned out the hair looks more or less good I would
00:33:27 have made it a little whiter
00:33:28 but now we are going to do the
00:33:30 interpretation of  grandma ok ok ready
00:33:33 let's see what they want me to say
00:33:35 well let's do the farewell with
00:33:39 the character of the old woman let's see
00:33:40 how she stays alive we have to make the
00:33:43 changes like this then let's do it let's
00:33:45 see if they understand my voice with this but  It goes,
00:33:49 my child says very well,
00:33:52 thank you very much for watching the video, I say goodbye to
00:33:55 your Mexican
00:33:58 and whatever you are doing, have my
00:34:02 patient,
00:34:06 yes,
00:34:11 I think a lot, God bless you
00:34:16 and nothing, I love you very much,
00:34:20 many children,
00:34:29 always this type
00:34:33 and they give us the boys.  They hear a lot
00:34:35 and I'm leaving I have to change this already
00:34:38 scared me I love you very much They send you
00:34:40 many many greetings and you know that they can
00:34:42 do wonders in fact this looks
00:34:44 like looking from the
00:34:47 side I'm leaving because if I don't I'm going to
00:34:50 become the old woman  but I would love to
00:34:52 show you a little more, maybe a
00:34:54 monologue, maybe I have to
00:34:57 do something to them, no, but well, now that I'm leaving,
00:34:59 the old woman is leaving, but the old woman has
00:35:02 to be in a good position,
00:35:06 but not much, because
00:35:12 take care of it, see
00:35:15 you soon,
00:35:19 it's my turn to eat
",3
102,"00:00:00 today I'm going to play minecraft and we're going to
00:00:04 explore we're going to explore yes yes
00:00:10 [Music]
00:00:14 hello well yes I've made a new world of
00:00:18 minecraft a new world that I don't know
00:00:22 and I'm going to explore but I'm not going to explore
00:00:26 anything
00:00:28 I'm not going to explore new  caves and mines
00:00:33 mines where you are going to mine and
00:00:38 places dark places because maybe I will find
00:00:42 interesting things but also
00:00:46 surely there are enemies and I have to
00:00:49 fight
00:00:53 and well I'm going to explore but something
00:00:56 important in minecraft is to have wood to
00:01:00 have wood from trees not this is
00:01:03 a tree  and i'm going to take wood because it's
00:01:07 pretty pretty important
00:01:11 and for that you have to punch the
00:01:14 tree
00:01:16 in punches it
00:01:19 's pretty slow 2.2 punches
00:01:22 this is not completely unrealistic
00:01:26 in real life you couldn't break a
00:01:29 tree with your punches but hey it's
00:01:33 fun otherwise it would be very  boring
00:01:36 minecraft if you couldn't punch and
00:01:40 so I have wood and with wood I can
00:01:46 make planks of wood
00:01:50 with planks of wood I can make
00:01:53 for the los  sticks are necessary
00:01:58 now you will see you can make a lot of
00:02:00 tools with the sticks
00:02:04 and this is a workbench here here
00:02:09 that doesn't bother and on the workbench
00:02:12 I can make bigger things
00:02:17 and the first thing is going to be a pick
00:02:23 a pick
00:02:25 and
00:02:28 I don't know if  I'm going to make a sword
00:02:31 a sword what happens that the sword the
00:02:33 sword is not the wooden sword is very
00:02:37 loose it is not very strong it does not hit very
00:02:40 hard and around here I would have to have rock
00:02:44 there was rock I am not going to take rock I am going to

00:10:39 I'm hearing enemies
00:10:45 we're going to get out of here
00:10:53 super super realistic you can't
00:10:57 go up the cascade
00:11:03 s  It's getting dark it's dark
00:11:07 how bad let's see what am I going to do I'm going to
00:11:11 hide here
00:11:16 I'm going to hide and spend the night here
00:11:20 hiding like a coward
00:11:24 like a coward who doesn't dare doesn't
00:11:25 dare to fight
00:11:27 what am I am a  funky
00:11:36 I'm going to make a good one here is that I
00:11:38 don't really need space
00:11:42 I'm just going to make myself I'm going to make myself a door
00:11:44 with the door
00:11:46 I can I can see I can see outside
00:11:49 and I can see if it's still night or not
00:11:51 and can wait
00:11:53 can you hit the night then
00:11:57 here with this I make myself a door well
00:12:00 three doors
00:12:01 three doors
00:12:07 and the door
00:12:10 and see there because I don't see that there are
00:12:14 different types of doors and in this
00:12:16 with this one you can't see the outside
00:12:19 well well nothing I'll
00:12:21 wait here I'll wait here until daylight
00:12:23 because when it's night there are
00:12:26 enemies there are dangerous enemies that are going to
00:12:29 kill
00:12:31 me so I'll wait until
00:12:34 daylight so that the sun rises and I'll
00:12:37 go hunting to hunt animals to eat to be
00:12:41 able to improve to heal myself the energy to
00:12:43 heal  life because now I
00:12:46 only have 44 hearts left not 4 out of 10
00:12:50 and if you eat if you're not hungry
00:12:54 then life goes up you can recover your
00:12:57 strength but now I'm hungry you're
00:13:00 a little hungry and I need to eat
00:13:03 so I'll wait I'll wait until
00:13:06 morning
00:13:08 but  It's a few minutes in this game
00:13:11 I don't remember if it's like 5 minutes or something
00:13:14 like that but you can see here you can see that
00:13:17 the stars are moving they are
00:13:19 passing and if you have to wait
00:13:24 to see
00:14:03 one thing that I can do is
00:14:06 build  do things I can't make
00:14:10 an oven
00:14:13 an oven
00:14:17 and this oven is used
00:14:19 to cook food but it is also
00:14:22 used to make metal to make iron
00:14:26 because here I have I have iron but
00:14:30 I
00:14:32 have raw iron I have iron mixed with rock and you have to
00:14:34 melt you have to  melt the iron to be
00:14:38 able to have
00:14:41 iron ingots and now you will see the ingots
00:14:44 are like gold ingots, no, but
00:14:46 these are made of iron
00:14:49 very well and with iron you can  make
00:14:51 a sword a stronger sword a pick
00:14:54 also a stronger
00:14:58 pick I'm going to make myself an ax with a
00:15:01 stick
00:15:02 I don't have sticks I don't have sticks left to
00:15:06 make axes now we will teach what
00:15:09 an ax is
00:15:13 but I don't have sticks either to make
00:15:16 swords for  to do anything we
00:15:18 need sticks for any
00:15:19 tool you have to use sticks and
00:15:25 to make sticks he needed 22
00:15:28 wooden planks and I only have 1
00:15:31 so nothing
00:15:33 else what can I do I can't do anything
00:15:37 just wait I have to wait
00:15:42 with this I can make a bow the  arches
00:15:45 the arches are going well
00:15:47 and if I have gravel there is no serious and here
00:15:50 no no
00:15:52 good well I hope nothing even if the
00:15:55 iron is made that's it it's over the
00:15:57 iron is over
00:16:01 okay that's it I have all the
00:16:04 iron ingots tomorrow when the sun rises
00:16:07 I will be able to  make more tools it's still
00:16:11 dark
00:16:36 I'm going to make an ax I don't have sticks I
00:16:44 do
00:16:48 n't dare
00:16:50 I dare to look for wood
00:16:58 I need I need wood urgently
00:17:04 I hope they don't see me no  the
00:17:07 monsters the enemies see me

00:32:15 hurts me it is not that maybe I have killed him and  It
00:32:18 was
00:32:19 not necessary, it is not necessary to kill him, well, if it doesn't
00:32:22 hurt, once the poor little pick killed him,
00:32:26 here is the iron, the dear iron,
00:32:29 but I have to go down below, if I go down
00:32:32 or below, there will be diamonds and other things.
00:32:35 Interesting because there is a bit of
00:32:37 coal
00:32:41 but I've seen more iron I don't need all
00:32:43 the coal
00:32:45 but iron yes all the iron I
00:32:48 can iron is quite valuable and it
00:32:51 's super dark here it's
00:32:55 worth
00:32:59 more iron
00:33:03 I don't know how deep the cave will be
00:33:06 because there are caves  that they are not very
00:33:07 deep ions and now it is getting
00:33:11 quite small
00:33:12 so I am afraid that it will not be very
00:33:15 very deep the cave is light down there
00:33:20 and scary
00:33:23 hello little friend
00:33:27 what am I going to do I
00:33:31 don't want you at all no I don't have to
00:33:33 go  there at all because there is no
00:33:36 way to go anywhere here it's
00:33:38 over well it's the same I'm not going to I
00:33:40 'm not going to bother it it
00:33:43 doesn't bother me it's down there it can't
00:33:45 come because the water then pushes the
00:33:48 water doesn't let it come
00:33:51 good  in another place because beyond that
00:33:56 don't worry there are going to be
00:33:58 enemies that I have to fight anyway
00:34:01 and the wind
00:34:06 picks up
00:34:09 more iron here
00:34:11 and up to 3
00:34:15 if it seems that the bats don't attack
00:34:17 so it's good
00:34:22 here there are  lava lava can be used
00:34:27 well any material use
00:34:29 this because I don't need this at all
00:34:31 you can use this to hide it
00:34:35 let's say or to remove it but you can also
00:34:39 find the source the origin
00:34:43 of the lava
00:34:46 you can put
00:34:48 a block there
00:34:52 I'm here risking risking  my
00:34:54 life
00:34:56 well
00:34:59 over there there is nothing mind the sooner
00:35:01 we are going to look let's see here the
00:35:04 truth
00:35:06 I need torches
00:35:09 the water here I don't know if it's my friend
00:35:14 there
00:35:17 is lapis lazuli this is lapis lazuli lapis
00:35:19 lazuli well I know it from
00:35:22 minecraft I don't know exactly in real life
00:35:24 what is lapis lazuli for but
00:35:28 here I think it is used to give
00:35:30 things a blue color lapis lazuli is
00:35:33 blue and can be used to make things
00:35:37 blue and I don't have I don't have so I
00:35:40 have space
00:35:42 yes yes I have space ok
00:35:45 what else was there  iron there is a little
00:35:47 iron there
00:35:49 to see
00:35:52 the rite cute and dear' with me with
00:35:57 dad very well it's
00:36:00 okay that more up there I
00:36:03 don't want to go up I want to go down because I do
00:36:05 downstairs there are more valuable things there are
00:36:07 diamonds and there are other precious metals
00:36:12 around here it may be that there is iron but
00:36:15 good enough
00:36:18 ah
00:36:20 water water rich water
00:36:22 good good luck lucky there was water
00:36:25 I'm going to make a bucket
00:36:27 I'm going to make a bucket because it's good to have
00:36:30 a bucket of water to throw water on when
00:36:32 you're burning
00:36:34 I can make myself I think it's 33 iron
00:36:39 to make a bucket and someone correct me I ca
00:36:42 n't hear you even if you correct me it's not
00:36:45 me but hey I'll see if I can make
00:36:49 a bucket there are recipes here
00:36:53 I will also need the work table
00:36:56 there are recipes
00:36:59 and this would be this tools
00:37:02 knows the cube here this is the cube you can
00:37:04 take álava with the cube I don't know the museum
00:37:07 melts the cube is there if there are only
00:37:10 three of perfect iron
00:37:12 I already have I already have five
00:37:16 zombie I don't
00:37:20 attacks I will do this to myself this also helps
00:37:24 me to get wool
00:37:27 where you are zombie I hear you very close
00:37:32 this
00:37:34 and this serves to shelter to cut
00:37:38 wool from sheep and it is very useful to
00:37:41 make a bed  You need wool to
00:37:43 make a bed,
00:37:45 as I discovered in the last video, the
00:37:50 wool has to be all the same color
00:37:52 because of course you are not going to make a bed by
00:37:55 mixing colors of wool,
00:37:59 but
00:38:01 hey, if I find several sheep of the
00:38:03 same color, I can easily make a bed.
00:38:06 let's eat I don't know what fills the
00:38:09 base the pig or eternity but I'm
00:38:12 hungry to see if with a pig with the
00:38:16 pig it's enough
00:38:18 ok
00:38:20 well I have some iron I'm not going to
00:38:22 finish because it takes it takes a while
00:38:25 but yes with this I can  do or
00:38:28 do something true yes boots boots and
00:38:32 iron boots very well and I can do this I
00:38:35 can wear it and it's more protection to
00:38:37 do the pants are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7
00:38:42 of irons and I would have enough
00:38:44 but hey I am I am  very macho
00:38:48 I don't need to have a full armor
00:38:54 oh okay
00:38:56 and what else I think is that I think I've already
00:38:59 explored most of the cave but I
00:39:07 'm not going to miss the opportunity to
00:39:10 get iron seems like an addict here
00:39:13 as if it were e  l iron out my drug
00:39:18 look over here I
00:39:22 wanted water I'm going to get water
00:39:26 where there is water
00:39:29 I want to get water with the bucket because
00:39:31 if the same thing happens to me as before if I
00:39:34 fall
00:39:35 [Music] well
00:39:38 no
00:39:47 this is not the first I don't want this
00:39:50 water because  This water helps me go up and down it
00:39:52 's like an elevator but there was
00:39:55 more water somewhere
00:39:59 there was more water but I don't want to release the
00:40:03 clipper well it's the same later I'll
00:40:06 find more water around here
00:40:11 oh
00:40:14 now
00:40:28 2
00:40:34 like that
00:40:37 damn if there are several zombies  It's
00:40:42 hard to keep them away and it's just that they
00:40:44 hit everyone because if they don't get
00:40:55 a little closer that way I'll
00:40:58 heal myself faster
00:41:00 okay good very good very good very good
00:41:07 okay bats but hey
00:41:09 bats are your friends bats are
00:41:12 also more
00:41:18 zombies  the little animals are very
00:41:20 cute the bats are flying in
00:41:27 real life I like them they are very
00:41:29 pretty
00:41:29 there are people who are scared
00:41:34 not by the bats but I
00:41:36 like it here on iron  I'm going to illuminate the
00:41:41 whole room to be safer to be
00:41:44 safe and I hear water there is also water, it's
00:41:47 worth a little lapis lazuli I don't know
00:41:52 why I'm going to do it I don't know if you can
00:41:55 make a blue bed, it
00:41:58 would be nice to have a blue bed
00:41:59 blue color come here it's not a flare it's a
00:42:02 torch torch
00:42:09 just a little bit of iron
00:42:12 here's a little more that's it and that's it
00:42:15 venice my land so here's a
00:42:18 small room with the smell of gold
00:42:23 and gold found
00:42:26 and here's water  Well take the water
00:42:29 later take the water more gold
00:42:31 today I was only afraid of this
00:42:37 [Applause] In
00:42:52 the end I couldn't I couldn't
00:42:54 kill it It's hard it's hard to kill the
00:42:57 clippers
00:42:58 okay,
00:43:00 by the way creepers I don't know if in
00:43:03 English it means how  something that is
00:43:05 scary
00:43:09 so here it goes very well
00:43:13 it is caught I would say that it can be mined in
00:43:19 minecraft and spread when you chop
00:43:21 when which I chop something gold can be
00:43:23 mined faster than iron
00:43:28 I think iron
00:43:31 and skeletons skeletons give my  edo
00:43:34 because they have tree 100 bow and
00:43:37 arrows and they hurt you they hurt you from
00:43:41 far away
00:43:44 I'm going to first clean the area
00:43:48 I'm going to clean the area of ​​enemies
00:44:01 here here it's not
00:44:03 big that's
00:44:06 good I'm going to risk it but there's no
00:44:09 mistake more iron
00:44:14 and a  a little more
00:44:19 and more iron is
00:44:23 worth
00:44:24 so
00:44:27 when here
00:44:37 I don't know if I need that much but
00:44:41 and for now I can forget about iron
00:44:46 because in the caves you always find
00:44:48 many metals
00:44:50 there is always a lot of iron
00:44:53 and a lot so what was there now what
00:44:58 so I can take it I don't remember
00:45:01 where was lora
00:45:09 here there is water here well
00:45:14 well I'm going to ignore the iron for now
00:45:16 because I already have a lot
00:45:18 and I'm going to see
00:45:21 where the gold was although
00:45:25 I still hear the skeletons
00:45:33 okay
00:45:35 very well
00:45:38 here we are
00:45:44 because I hadn't come to see it's the same
00:45:47 connect  It connects with the road from before,
00:45:50 it takes the same place, here
00:45:54 there is only coal
00:45:57 , I'm back in the same place, it's worth
00:45:59 it, there's more up there, no way, and I
00:46:03 brought it there,
00:46:09 so I'll give you everything.  or
00:46:15 here
00:46:32 more water
00:46:37 seems to end here
00:46:40 or it's going down
00:46:42 to down it's good the more now well
00:46:50 good iron too since we are since
00:46:54 we are well I take the iron it
00:46:55 doesn't weigh me down neither does it weigh you down in
00:46:58 this game you won't go  slow down because I have a
00:47:01 lot of iron
00:47:05 why
00:47:06 come and I have discovered something we are small
00:47:13 it means that I have found something
00:47:17 there is nothing
00:47:21 a little
00:47:34 but here there is nothing I don't know I don't know if
00:47:37 it means something that music yes
00:47:39 I have really found something that
00:47:42 in this game  you can go wherever you want
00:47:44 you can explain why go
00:47:46 anywhere
00:47:48 but it doesn't seem like there's anything
00:47:51 I don't know I don't know why there was the little music
00:47:55 but I think it has to mean
00:47:57 something
00:48:08 good well
00:48:12 I'm not giving up
00:48:14 maybe it was just nothing else
00:48:18 oh
00:48:19 oh
00:48:23 well  I'm going the other way and if not if there
00:48:27 is nothing else in a test state then I'll go to
00:48:28 another another cave
00:48:35 ah
00:48:45 this is the skeleton
00:49:02 the bone I want the bone I don't want this
00:49:07 this eye spider eye
00:49:13 how did it get here where it came from
00:49:15 skeletal
00:49:18 to the equine
00:49:21 here there are going to be more enemies I'm going
00:49:25 to make torches
00:49:31 and I have a few but hey I can do
00:49:33 more
00:49:34 very well nothing down he for
00:49:37 us is an idea
00:49:40 and why
00:49:42 and I think we're going to leave it here
00:49:46 look this gives you experience  also in
00:49:48 lapis lazuli it gives you experience points
00:49:51 I don't know what it's for in this game the
00:49:53 truth is in other games
00:49:56 with experience and before stronger or it
00:50:00 gives you more life points but minecraft not
00:50:03 in minecraft life not the hearts
00:50:06 the hearts you can always see  they are
00:50:09 the same
00:50:15 here we have lava dangerous lava
00:50:24 it will be saved next week
00:50:31 that's good this is an interesting place
00:50:34 to explore well I'm going to leave it here
00:50:37 I'm going to maybe put it in the furnace I'm going to
00:50:41 make iron and gold and other things
00:50:46 I'm going to put  also the work table
00:50:50 and well when we see each other in the
00:50:52 next episode
00:50:56 I will already have all the gold and iron when
00:50:59 it is ready
00:51:03 and I will have everything ready all the
00:51:07 iron from the iron here
00:51:11 and I will put the gold the gold
00:51:17 and see
00:51:19 you see you in the next episode see you
00:51:24 later
00:51:28 ah
00:51:31 ah
00:51:32 [Music]
",3
160,"00:00:00 Today I want to talk to you about the
00:00:03 reason why I think it is very good to
00:00:07 use a vpn to learn languages ​​to
00:00:13 learn Spanish how can you use a
00:00:16 vpn to watch series watch movies and other
00:00:21 content that you cannot see from your country
00:00:28 [Music]
00:00:30 ah
00:00:32 Well yes, a vpn can help you a lot
00:00:37 to learn languages ​​but I have to
00:00:40 tell you that this video is sponsored
00:00:43 by express vpn express vpn has not
00:00:50 given me money to make this video
00:00:52 but if you sign up if you
00:00:56 subscribe to vpn then dreaming spanish
00:01:12 Well, you will get a part of the price, no, so it's a vpn, for example, from your computer you have a computer and you connect JCE to
00:01:16 a server, JCE connects us to Netflix, for example,
00:01:19 JCE doesn't connect you and you ask for
00:01:24 Netflix, give me the series, give me the
00:01:28 paper house for example the series you are
00:01:30 watching not netflix go see where you are see
00:01:34 where you are
00:01:36 if he sees that you are in some countries then he
00:01:40 gives you more things or less things for
00:01:44 For example, if JCE connects you to Netflix
00:01:47 from a computer, your
00:01:50 computer is in the US, it's in the United States of
00:01:55 America, Netflix will teach you 433 things,
00:02:02 433 series and movies in Spanish.
00:02:13 also
00:02:17 a computer a computer on the internet in
00:02:21 the cloud jce connects them to a vpn and the
00:02:25 vpn connects to netflix what happens
00:02:30 are you not in spain and netflix
00:02:34 netflix thinks that you are in
00:02:37 spain
00:02:39 so yes from the us
00:02:45 these contents are in spanish  Not from the
00:02:48 United States
00:02:48 I offered you 433 things
00:02:53 from Spain there are 2,286 in Spain
00:03:00 if Netflix sees that you are in Spain it will
00:03:03 tell you okay I have 2,286 movies and series
00:03:09 in Spanish it is
00:03:12 five times five times more than from the
00:03:15 US that is not why I recommend using a vpn
00:03:20 if you already  you are watching series you are watching
00:03:24 movies in Spanish it can go very well
00:03:26 to have many more options to
00:03:30 watch series and movies to see more and to
00:03:34 be able to find the ones you re  Maybe
00:03:37 you like them
00:03:39 so this is an example with netflix
00:03:43 but there are other examples there are websites
00:03:47 of television channels for example that if
00:03:49 you are not in Spain or you are not in their
00:03:53 country in their country in Latin America
00:03:55 they will not let you watch some series or  they will
00:03:59 let us see nothing so for example in
00:04:02 spain this happens with rtve rtve is
00:04:10 the national television there are several
00:04:12 television and radio channels then there is
00:04:16 another company that is antena 3
00:04:19 the sixth and then there is telecinco
00:04:23 and 4 that all let you see everything if you are
00:04:29 in  spain if you are not in spain there are
00:04:32 things that you cannot see
00:04:35 all this the links the links to
00:04:39 see these television channels and their
00:04:42 series I leave them below in the description
00:04:45 okay this is in spain
00:04:50 you have seen what to do and do the
00:04:53 keys
00:04:55 so in spain you have these in
00:04:59 colombia there is rcn
00:05:03 rcn the good thing about netflix is ​​that you don't
00:05:09 need another account you don't have to
00:05:12 make another new netflix account
00:05:14 you don't have to make a separate account  You don't
00:05:18 have to pay for Netflix with a
00:05:21 Spanish card or a card from another country. You
00:05:24 can't use your card,
00:05:27 your Visa or
00:05:30 MasterCard, your country's credit or debit card with
00:05:34 the same account, just by going
00:05:36 to the change country extension in your browser
00:05:40 and  that's it you can see
00:05:43 everything in meff leaks another example netflix
00:05:46 from mexico offers you 970 programs
00:05:52 from mexico no they are still more more than
00:05:56 in the usa i don't know if the same as in
00:06:00 spain maybe some of you can see from
00:06:03 mexico that you can't see  from spain
00:06:06 but with express vpn
00:06:09 you can change countries at any
00:06:11 time very quickly so how to
00:06:15 find things in spanish on netflix
00:06:18 you have to go to netflix.com bar browse
00:06:24 bar audio ok try going to this
00:06:28 address and you should be able to choose
00:06:31 spanish there will be a list  a list of
00:06:34 languages ​​yes no if there is no spanish you will have
00:06:39 to make a profile on netflix you have
00:06:42 the profiles maybe you have to make a
00:06:46 profile hit make a profile a profile
00:06:49 new a profile later and make a profile
00:06:53 in Spanish then surely you can
00:06:56 find things only things with
00:06:59 audio in Spanish what happens with hb or hb or
00:07:04 in Spain we have h veo but for this
00:07:09 for hb or yes you have to make
00:07:12 a separate account  In HD you
00:07:16 need a card, a visa or
00:07:18 mastercard from Spain' so it doesn't go as
00:07:23 well as Netflix so among
00:07:27 there are several options there are different
00:07:30 companies that offer vpn I recommend
00:07:34 express because they give me money
00:07:38 but not really I already used
00:07:41 express I paid  I paid for express vpn
00:07:45 when I was in China when I lived
00:07:47 in China so from China I could see

00:09:46 and
00:09:47 [Music]
",3
194,"00:00:00 today I'm going to build my own city with
00:00:05 buildings roads schools hospitals
00:00:10 yes come come with me to see how I
00:00:14 do it
00:00:17 [Music]
00:00:20 hello well yes today I'm going to play cities
00:00:25 skyline this game that is similar to
00:00:29 simcity no and my goal is to make a
00:00:33 city where  people be happy be very
00:00:38 happy I'm going to try to be a good mayor
00:00:41 and if you like it if you like me to play
00:00:45 this game in the future I can also
00:00:48 try to be a bad mayor so
00:00:53 let's start as you can see it's similar to
00:00:56 simcity it's like a  more modern version
00:01:00 of sim city and i really liked
00:01:03 simcity when i was little in fact i
00:01:06 think i think it was the first
00:01:09 videogame i bought with my own money it
00:01:12 was sim city 3000 we bought it halfway
00:01:16 with my friend but hey this is quite
00:01:18 different  as you will see now you will see
00:01:22 why because they can be done look look
00:01:25 they can be made roads roads
00:01:27 with twists the roads can turn
00:01:31 my god that is much better than being
00:01:34 encouraged well let's start  r so
00:01:37 we have this area to begin with we can
00:01:40 build in this area and well after
00:01:44 it goes away it will grow we can
00:01:47 make the city bigger here
00:01:50 we already have the highway the highway that
00:01:54 comes to our city and then we have
00:01:56 to start here to build our
00:01:59 town our city  what we are going to do
00:02:02 we have roads different types of
00:02:05 roads for now if there are not many
00:02:08 types only this two
00:02:11 lane road very good with parking
00:02:13 spaces with little traffic what we are going
00:02:17 to do we are going to see we are going to enter here
00:02:20 maybe
00:02:22 very well and here when we build  it
00:02:26 shows us that it shows us to see it
00:02:30 shows us the space on the sides on each
00:02:32 side it shows the space where
00:02:35 things can be built houses can be built
00:02:38 and such good we are going to start
00:02:40 coming coming here then
00:02:45 here we are going
00:02:47 to see it is like that no  one less maybe I don't know if
00:02:51 I can undo undo what I've done
00:02:56 okay here I can delete the road
00:03:01 I'm going to do the one that has a  here
00:03:06 345 here not again very well very well
00:03:12 here is my perfectionism all
00:03:15 fixed
00:03:19 well here has not been very perfectionist
00:03:21 but well here we already have the first
00:03:23 street which will be the first street
00:03:26 in our city we can make zones
00:03:29 we are going to do here  residential area
00:03:34 people are going to live here all this is a
00:03:36 residential area come on if all this is going to
00:03:40 be good for now here and here
00:03:43 then it is slow we are going to give it here
00:03:46 move forward and it tells us here what
00:03:51 we need
00:03:52 what things we need if the people are
00:03:56 happy or not, at some point he is going to
00:03:58 tell us what he needs but
00:04:01 one thing that I do know is necessary,
00:04:04 we are going to stop it, it is electricity and water,
00:04:07 water, let's see, there is no water, we do not have
00:04:12 to get water to people, so
00:04:15 One way is from the river to see what is
00:04:18 here pumping station from here
00:04:21 we can bring water bring water
00:04:25 to the people who pass by when people
00:04:30 pee they poop it has dirty water we will
00:04:35 need this a system  sewer drain
00:04:38 dirty water from the sewers
00:04:41 and this is going to go to the river and from the river we want to
00:04:46 take clean water we don't want to take
00:04:49 dirty water no so
00:04:53 we are going to put the pumping station a little far up a little
00:04:57 up in the direction above  of the river
00:05:00 and we are going to bring sewers from here
00:05:05 to the houses
00:05:07 and that it covers here all of this area very
00:05:11 well that we need more electricity
00:05:13 a power plant there is
00:05:17 coal but the coal plant there has
00:05:21 pollution two things pollution and
00:05:24 noise pollution make noise make
00:05:28 noise too then  people do not
00:05:30 like to live near a station of
00:05:35 something that makes noise of anything
00:05:36 that makes noise we are going to try
00:05:40 to put it here ah but it
00:05:43 has to have a road for
00:05:45 water it is not necessary but for this  yes
00:05:47 well we are going to put a road here
00:05:50 this is going to be a road to our
00:05:53 industrial zone here you will see the
00:05:57 industries and the power plant will
00:06:01 be here t  Everything is very good, here it is coming,
00:06:04 there is already a power station and we
00:06:08 have to lay power lines
00:06:10 from an area that is connected.
00:06:14 How do we do this? I don't really know how it
00:06:18 works, but here we can bring and then
00:06:21 we have to bring electricity here
00:06:23 too, let's see, let's see.  if this works as
00:06:27 we see this you have to connect it there is no
00:06:30 electricity you have electricity no no
00:06:32 here and here yes there is electricity it only
00:06:36 comes here ok when there are houses
00:06:40 when people build things there
00:06:42 they connect the electricity is connected by itself
00:06:45 it is already connecting ok  You just have to
00:06:48 let people build elevated highways very well.
00:06:50 Okay, we have
00:06:53 elevated highways. What else do we go here?
00:06:57 We have a demand for residences.
00:07:12 now it seems that it is okay that more
00:07:14 water consumption this is the water is ok
00:07:17 we are going to need commercial and
00:07:21 industrial areas  ials but for now they don't
00:07:25 ask me for them maybe we don't need to
00:07:27 build them here we already see the first
00:07:30 houses and there are people here living who
00:07:34 want they have garbage I think they
00:07:36 have garbage we need to build here
00:07:41 I don't know how we build it a
00:07:44 garbage disposal system okay I  raised I have been
00:07:48 my first garbage city that this to
00:07:51 delete zone industrial zone well I
00:07:55 have no way to create here something for an
00:07:58 area to dump garbage districts
00:08:02 garbage needs a population of 400
00:08:05 I have to wait for the
00:08:07 population to rise to see if it rises that it reaches  400
00:08:12 and then I can seriously I have to leave
00:08:16 the dirty people here with the garbage
00:08:20 so that they let me create something to create a
00:08:24 garbage system this is my city
00:08:27 how many children adolescents young
00:08:29 adults elderly and the level is worth
00:08:34 attractiveness of the city attractive zero
00:08:37 attractive  0% you are going to live in the garbage
00:08:41 surrounded by garbage we have that when
00:08:45 the population rises here
00:08:46 I see that it puts more 1272 I don't know if it rises every
00:08:50 day now it has b  Ajado ok I think there are
00:08:53 few things few residential areas
00:08:56 I am going to fill all this with residential
00:08:58 now it will rise to more and there is demand
00:09:02 for a commercial area so I can here
00:09:05 if I can do all this commercial and
00:09:08 all this here residential and maybe some
00:09:11 stores here when I enter  ok, let's see,
00:09:15 the toilet doesn't work and the water in the shower
00:09:17 smells horrible what's wrong with the
00:09:18 sewage I don't know what's wrong with the
00:09:21 sewer well I know what's wrong
00:09:23 with the sewer we need here
00:09:26 this drain the drain where can it
00:09:30 be here I'm not going to  put here and
00:09:34 that the water reaches it then there is something very
00:09:36 funny about this game and that is that the
00:09:40 water, the water pipes and the
00:09:43 sewers are the same, it works
00:09:46 through the same tubes, well, not the
00:09:50 same ones, don't you see that there are two colors
00:09:52 maybe  blue clean water and green
00:09:56 dirty water sewage water and here I
00:09:59 also have to bring electricity if not it doesn't
00:10:02 work let's see where from here
00:10:05 here very well here it already has
00:10:09 electricity available  Onibility of
00:10:11 electricity Very low consumption I
00:10:14 have I have a lot of power Ok that's it,
00:10:17 the drain works here and it's
00:10:20 night there now I don't see anything but look there are
00:10:22 lights there are lights on the street how good
00:10:27 look in my houses we can
00:10:30 zoom in a lot look they have names  of the streets
00:10:35 three families
00:10:38 young illiterate people have no
00:10:42 education there are no schools yet in my
00:10:44 house let's see the truck mineral truck
00:10:48 don't look
00:10:51 there is a lot of detail you can see here everything
00:10:54 beautiful street has the same name
00:10:57 all this street has the same name and
00:10:59 We don't have anything newer we have to
00:11:02 reach 400 to see if we reach 400
00:11:06 inhabitants here there are already houses we
00:11:10 need more we don't need more
00:11:13 residential area because if not here we won't
00:11:17 reach 400 here I have deleted I want to
00:11:21 delete only this well I have deleted
00:11:24 everything here  another street how long this has
00:11:28 to be let's
00:11:42 see  here aligned and another street here
00:11:45 very good and here again
00:11:49 residential area with a residential and
00:11:52 residential I think this is fine
00:11:55 it's night I don't know if I want it to be
00:11:58 night it doesn't have to be night no
00:12:00 options okay deactivate activate
00:12:05 cycles  day and night he deactivated it and now
00:12:08 well always day better not like this let's
00:12:10 see what we are doing or people
00:12:13 need to work come let's
00:12:16 let people work industrial zone it's
00:12:18 still raining so it rains
00:12:21 that's why I think I can make it just
00:12:23 part  I can't make it just part of
00:12:26 it I can't draw here how I do it here it's
00:12:29 okay to draw
00:12:33 that all of this is an industrial zone here and
00:12:36 here very well okay you already have an industry
00:12:40 what problems we have that you need
00:12:42 here people have it nice here with the
00:12:45 rain we can see here  suv cars
00:12:47 owned by willow lewis
00:12:50 people have names everyone
00:12:52 has names you can rename
00:12:54 the car seriously watch mode so
00:12:57 watch something  or how strange it's not worth it so
00:13:01 the water is working or that you're doing
00:13:05 well I don't know if I can select maybe
00:13:08 removing water here normal operation
00:13:11 drainage system capacity 100
00:13:14 120,000 people are happy but I have
00:13:17 to increase the population it's still okay there
00:13:20 are areas where I lack water  There's no water here,
00:13:24 look, look, if we haven't put water here, we
00:13:27 're going to make sure that the
00:13:29 water reaches everyone here
00:13:31 like that
00:13:34 and then, well, more or less, it's not perfect,
00:13:37 it's not optimal, but if the water already reaches
00:13:41 everywhere, it's fine.
00:13:44 So the population is now up, the
00:13:46 industries that we have lack water,
00:13:49 the industries need water,
00:13:52 I also think that the water is going to be the most complicated thing in
00:13:55 the game, it will be the
00:13:57 water that reaches everyone, but it
00:14:00 is important if there is not  water people have a
00:14:02 bad time very well how are we doing with money
00:14:04 17,000 people ask for industry they want
00:14:07 industry but hey there is no
00:14:11 zone industrial zone there is space here
00:14:14 to build industries for now  It's going very
00:14:16 well, let's see if we reach 400 and we can
00:14:20 take care of the garbage now. I don't know
00:14:22 what people do with the garbage. I don't know where
00:14:25 they're going to throw the garbage. It's not around here.
00:14:30 name of
00:14:32 why the name of the street is now
00:14:34 slim lewis or louis as de louis and here
00:14:38 beautiful has changed the name to this
00:14:40 d
00:14:41 and the media continues to be
00:14:43 beautiful street how curious it is all automatic
00:14:46 the names of the streets 300  We reach
00:14:49 300, let's go well, I know we can change
00:14:52 the taxes, but I'm going to see the
00:14:57 budget, they'll give us work, it will produce more
00:14:59 electricity if we give them more
00:15:01 budget, more money, okay, I don't know if
00:15:04 this is important for now, I'll leave it like this,
00:15:07 income tax income here here you
00:15:12 can touch  i need 400 inhabitants
00:15:14 there are also parts of the game are
00:15:18 locked they are unlocked when you
00:15:20 reach certain milestones certain
00:15:23 positions not certain certain little ones
00:15:28 certain things you get with the
00:15:31 city let's see  Here there is a
00:15:35 general restaurant I am very well and then we have
00:15:38 different
00:15:41 densities low and high density low and high low and
00:15:45 high I also think that we have to
00:15:47 reach
00:15:48 somewhere some milestone to be
00:15:52 able to use them here you are fine or they
00:15:56 don't complain  You're welcome there is dirt there is
00:15:58 society because of the factories and the
00:16:01 power station but for now I don't have other
00:16:04 better ways I have this yes I do have
00:16:08 wind turbines yes they make noise but
00:16:11 do not pollute the air cost 6,000 for
00:16:15 how many megawatts between 0 and 8 can be
00:16:19 zero yes  there is little little wind okay there are
00:16:23 goals I have not become a village with
00:16:26 400 now I can use taxes
00:16:31 garbage service hospital and school well I am going
00:16:34 to do everything I need a
00:16:37 garbage service with a landfill that I am going to put
00:16:40 where I am going to put the landfill  I don't know
00:16:43 how big it has to be next
00:16:45 to a road I can also do
00:16:47 how I'm going to do this you can do
00:16:49 here a road has 4
00:16:52 I can do it here and  make all of
00:16:58 this a landfill no no this is not a
00:17:00 landfill rubbish here it has to be
00:17:04 next to a road ok i'm going to put it
00:17:07 here this is a landfill and the
00:17:10 landfill fills up but you can also
00:17:13 process the garbage you can recycle  and
00:17:16 do other things with the garbage and when
00:17:19 it's close to being full maybe we can
00:17:20 do other things with the garbage
00:17:23 build an incineration plant
00:17:25 but of course the incineration plant
00:17:28 well I can't use it I still need
00:17:31 a bigger population and of course it
00:17:34 pollutes a lot no  it will create a lot a lot of
00:17:38 pollution hospital well they only give me
00:17:41 a hospital I will put it in a
00:17:43 place where people can use if
00:17:47 people can get here okay it reaches the
00:17:50 whole world and then a school
00:17:55 I can put the school here and also
00:17:58 very well it also serves  everyone
00:18:00 serves everyone yes yes I don't think it
00:18:04 can be seen because of the color well I don't know let's
00:18:07 see let's see let's see touched here I can see
00:18:10 to locate or sell I can't  see the area,
00:18:14 the area that the hospital reaches, no,
00:18:17 but when you build it, when building
00:18:20 a hospital, for example, it tells you
00:18:23 where it goes from the areas that are
00:18:25 covered, then we see that all this
00:18:28 is green, so it means that
00:18:30 this hospital is doing well now  it reaches
00:18:33 all the people the school not much no the
00:18:37 school only goes as
00:18:40 far as here the green zone I need another
00:18:43 school I don't know if I need another school it's
00:18:45 10,000 and I have 15,000 only
00:18:49 that's enough
00:18:51 what I can do is connect the
00:18:53 road no because here it will be easier to
00:18:56 get to school I can make this
00:18:59 road here with a curve can
00:19:02 make the road not like this not how I
00:19:05 do it like this now the school should arrive
00:19:08 the school now yes well it arrives a little
00:19:11 a little more
00:19:11 neither  very strange but well
00:19:14 we have a lot of capacity in the school we
00:19:18 do not have institutes or universities for
00:19:20 now it is a basic school a primary school let's
00:19:22 see for now I'm going to give it up  jar
00:19:24 like this I don't know how to know if I'm doing well
00:19:30 if people have access to education or
00:19:32 not there are illiterates with primary education
00:19:35 0 low density building yes I think
00:19:39 it's this and without siesta
00:19:42 and I think it doesn't reach it doesn't reach
00:19:44 the  school everyone maybe I can
00:19:47 build one here like I would build a
00:19:50 school here I have to build a house
00:19:53 but hey what happens now yes now it has
00:19:55 turned green ok yeah I'm not sure
00:20:00 it needs to be two schools but hey
00:20:03 I already have two schools let's see here school
00:20:06 normal there are two students out of 300 per
00:20:10 population the amount of population I
00:20:12 don't need two schools there aren't 104 out of 300
00:20:17 but hey they need more houses they want
00:20:20 more houses very well we're going to
00:20:24 build long roads here yes what's up what's

158,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about the previous king of
00:00:03 Spain, Juan Carlos, first, Juan Carlos,
00:00:08 first, who is the father of the current king,
00:00:10 because many people liked him, he
00:00:14 liked Juan Carlos, first he was a fan, he was a
00:00:17 fan of the king, but now there are many
00:00:22 people who don't like him.  he even likes juan carlos
00:00:25 first he left spain yes yes
00:00:29 then juan carlos first is king or
00:00:33 was he was king of spain since 1975 if his
00:00:40 grandfather was king his grandfather had already been
00:00:43 king and was king until 1931 until
00:00:52 1931 his grandfather was king king  then came a
00:00:56 republic in which there was no king then
00:00:59 came the war came a dictatorship and
00:01:03 after the dictatorship in 1975 juan
00:01:08 carlos was made king his father no his
00:01:12 father was never king he never had the
00:01:15 chance to be king so until
00:01:18 75 there was  a dictatorship the dictatorship of
00:01:22 franco and franco chose him he chose
00:01:26 juan carlos first to be king and
00:01:29 at that time there was a government there was a
00:01:32 government but it was not a
00:01:35 democratic government but well there was a president there
00:01:39 were ministers and e  n 1975 franco the
00:01:46 dictator dies franco dies and at
00:01:49 that time many people many
00:01:52 people in spain hoped that the country
00:01:56 would open up
00:01:58 that it would open up that it would become a
00:02:01 little freer that there would be more
00:02:02 freedoms and they hoped that there would be more
00:02:05 democracy but
00:02:08 the  The president at that time and part
00:02:11 of the government did not want they did not want to make
00:02:14 reforms they did not want to make
00:02:17 real reforms serious reforms
00:02:20 important reforms and the president does it the
00:02:23 president resigns he leaves and then the
00:02:26 king supported a change towards democracy he
00:02:29 supported continuing on the democratic path
00:02:33 convert Spain into a democracy and
00:02:36 this change ended in 1977 since 1977 in
00:02:45 Spain we have had a
00:02:47 democratic monarchy we have had a king but
00:02:51 also elections and a
00:02:53 democratic government I think it was a good idea it
00:02:56 was a good idea for Juan Carlos to
00:02:59 first support democracy because
00:03:03 during  the 20th century in the
00:03:07 20th century all the kings the kings who
00:03:12 have tried to cling to power what  They have
00:03:15 tried to continue with power since
00:03:18 most of them have ended up either dead or
00:03:22 exiled in exile in exile
00:03:25 outside their country,
00:03:27 but well, the fact that Juan Carlos
00:03:29 supported democracy made
00:03:34 many people in Spain many people in
00:03:37 Spain  I would like many people in
00:03:40 Spain to support him as king and there is
00:03:43 a second reason a second reason
00:03:46 why many people also liked him
00:03:50 and it happened in 1981
00:03:55 in 1981 it happened on
00:04:03 February 23, 1981
00:04:07 and they were a group  of civil guards the
00:04:11 civil guard is like a police force
00:04:15 sometimes it's a bit like an army it's
00:04:17 like a mixture of police and army
00:04:20 but more like police and there was a
00:04:25 group a group of civil guards who
00:04:28 entered the congress they entered the
00:04:32 congress when  they were choosing a
00:04:35 president they were deciding who was going
00:04:38 to be the next president well they
00:04:41 entered with weapons they went to congress with weapons they
00:04:43 tried to carry out a
00:04:46 coup a coup and return to a
00:04:50 dictatorship  So that there would be no more democracy
00:04:52 and that there would be a dictatorship again, the
00:04:58 whole world
00:05:11 then King Juan Carlos first
00:05:13 went on television, he appeared on
00:05:17 television saying no, no, that there
00:05:21 was not going to be another dictatorship, that the constitution had to be
00:05:24 respected, respect the law
00:05:26 and  that there was going to continue to be democracy
00:05:29 then more people also began to
00:05:33 approve of the king's monarchy, more
00:05:35 people began to like the king
00:05:37 but recently in recent
00:05:40 years several things have happened that have
00:05:44 caused many people to dislike
00:05:47 the  King no and I know that this is the reason
00:05:50 why you are here you want to
00:05:54 know because corruption crime
00:05:58 bad things no then for a long
00:06:02 time it was already known that Juan Carlos
00:06:05 first had lovers that the king had
00:06:08 lovers that he went with with various  women
00:06:11 but the problems the real problems
00:06:15 began
00:06:17 in 2011 to see blue maybe
00:06:21 in 2011 in 2011 his daughter the king's daughter
00:06:26 and his son-in-law the husband of the king's daughter
00:06:30 you  they saw legal problems due to
00:06:34 corruption due to tax evasion due to
00:06:37 money laundering and in 2012 the king had
00:06:42 an accident and it was also
00:06:46 very important news in 2012 spain
00:06:49 was still in the crisis there were many people
00:06:52 without work the king went to botswana
00:06:56 botswana in africa he was  to hunt elephants he
00:07:00 went to kill elephants during the hunt he
00:07:03 had an accident he hurt himself and that is
00:07:07 why many people found out that he had
00:07:10 gone hunting elephants if he had not
00:07:12 had this accident we
00:07:15 would not have realized it we would not know
00:07:17 then in 2013
00:07:21 he  He found out that King Juan Carlos
00:07:25 had first used two million two
00:07:29 million two million euros, not
00:07:32 public money, money that was not his,
00:07:36 not his money. He used that money to
00:07:39 renovate a house.
00:07:48 a house that was in the
00:07:52 compound where the royal family lives
00:07:55 well it's not a castle it's a house but
00:07:57 well we're going to pretend it's a
00:07:59 castle and here I saw  via one of his lovers
00:08:04 corina larsen I think you will
00:08:07 hear this name plus colina larsen
00:08:10 was one of his lovers she lived in the same
00:08:13 compound in the same area where the
00:08:17 royal family lived in another house and juan carlos
00:08:20 used two million euros to reform
00:08:23 this house to fix it to
00:08:25 improve this house and the king and corina corina
00:08:30 larsen had met in botswana at
00:08:34 the botswana elephant hunt in
00:08:37 2014 the king abdicates the king says he is no
00:08:42 longer king he is no longer going to be king and
00:08:45 his son becomes king many people say
00:08:48 that the king did this
00:08:51 so that the image
00:08:55 of the royal house would not worsen so as not to harm his
00:08:58 son not to harm his son not to make
00:09:01 it more
00:09:05 difficult for his son to reign in the future  to be king of
00:09:08 Spain so as not to make the Spanish
00:09:11 have a worse and worse image of the
00:09:15 royal house but the problems do not end here
00:09:18 this year in 2020 it has been known
00:09:22 that the king received 100 million
00:09:26 because he received 100 100 million he received 10  0
00:09:30 million saudi arabia from the country of
00:09:33 saudi arabia gave him 100 million
00:09:36 because because they gave so much money a
00:09:40 government from another country to this money this
00:09:45 money received it in 2012 if he received it
00:09:49 as donations they said it was a
00:09:53 donation
00:09:54 but this money has been related  with
00:09:59 some works that took place in saudi
00:10:02 arabia saudi arabia contracted works to
00:10:07 manufacture a train a
00:10:09 high-speed train line and a train like the bird of
00:10:13 spain a high-speed train and
00:10:15 apparently king juan carlos
00:10:18 helped helped in those negotiations he
00:10:21 got  The company from Spain
00:10:24 will lower the price and
00:10:28 as a thank you as a thank you because the
00:10:32 government of Saudi Arabia gave him this
00:10:35 gift of one hundred thousand one hundred million of one hundred
00:10:38 million euros
00:10:40 so when this was known when
00:10:43 Spain found out about this donation the king
00:10:47 current felipe felipe sixth the king said
00:10:52 that he renounced his
00:10:55 father's inheritance that he did not accept money that he
00:10:59 would receive from his father that he was not going to
00:11:01 accept  ar any money from his father or an
00:11:03 inheritance when his father died that
00:11:06 he would not accept the money from the king of the
00:11:08 previous king of Juan Carlos first not
00:11:11 then that he was not going to
00:11:14 benefit from these 100 million and well and
00:11:18 others and more  money and also king
00:11:21 felipe sixth took his father's salary
00:11:25 he took his salary until then until
00:11:28 this year
00:11:30 juan carlos first still received a
00:11:33 salary he received money every year from the
00:11:36 state for being part of the royal family
00:11:38 for being part of the royal house well
00:11:42 King Felipe the Sixth received a salary. He
00:11:46 took it from him, he said, he already has
00:11:49 enough money, I take his salary,
00:11:52 so for this, for this, for everything
00:11:56 that happened, what happened before 2014,
00:12:01 what happened before the king abdicated.
00:12:04 the king ceased to be king the king
00:12:08 cannot be judged they cannot judge him
00:12:11 not the kings in Spain kings and their
00:12:15 children are above the law the law
00:12:18 does not apply to them they can do whatever they
00:12:21 want they cannot they cannot be  can
00:12:24 judge  They cannot go to prison but
00:12:27 after 2014 starting in 2014 if the
00:12:34 king commits a crime he commits a crime well
00:12:37 the king the old king juan carlos
00:12:38 first no if juan carlos first commits
00:12:42 a new crime well yes yes he
00:12:45 can be judged  You can not judge for this
00:12:47 new crime and now this year they have
00:12:51 begun to investigate
00:12:55 the former king, the former king for also
00:12:59 tax evasion and money laundering
00:13:03 so on August 3, 2020
00:13:09 the news came out the train the king and the
00:13:13 former king  he has left spain he has
00:13:16 left spain
00:13:19 in spain he is called the emeritus the king
00:13:22 emeritus the previous kingdom well on
00:13:27 august 3rd we learned that the king
00:13:30 had left spain the spanish
00:13:33 government said so the spanish government communicated
00:13:36 it  I knew I already knew it before
00:13:38 but I still hadn't said anything and they
00:13:42 said that from now on the king was going
00:13:46 to live abroad and he's going to live in
00:13:48 another country he didn't say they didn't say where they didn't
00:13:52 know where and they said it was to
00:13:55 do  He made it easier for his son to reign to
00:13:58 make it easier for his son Felipe the
00:14:01 sixth to become king and he also said that he
00:14:05 was available to the Spanish justice system,
00:14:07 yes, for the crimes
00:14:12 of money laundering and tax evasion
00:14:15 if he was going to be tried  that he
00:14:18 was available and that he would return to
00:14:21 spain what happens he did not say which country
00:14:25 we do not know if the country he is going to
00:14:29 is really a country where he would be
00:14:31 extradited would send him in spain- we
00:14:35 do not know if he would really return if he
00:14:38 has to return it is something that  I guess
00:14:41 we'll see, we'll see it in the future, although
00:14:44 I don't have much confidence in this because
00:14:48 because the government, the government of
00:14:51 Spain,
00:14:54 has helped Juan Carlos
00:14:57 first to hide things several times and has helped
00:15:01 Juan Carlos first to hide his
00:15:04 lovers for  An example of not knowing, well,
00:15:07 some problems that he had had,
00:15:10 but of course, the image of kings, the
00:15:14 image of the monarchy of the royal house, right
00:15:16 now is at the worst moment
00:15:21 in history.  recent ai in the worst
00:15:24 moment it has been in recent
00:15:25 decades
00:15:27 and the emeritus the former king juan carlos
00:15:30 first it is known that he has been at
00:15:34 least he has been in the arab emirates it is not
00:15:38 known if he is going to stay there if he is going to
00:15:40 stay to live  in the arab emirates or not
00:15:43 or is he going to go somewhere else
00:15:45 so well there is this debate about whether the king
00:15:49 is simply living
00:15:52 abroad to be calmer or if he
00:15:55 has fled if he has escaped from
00:15:57 justice in spain and well  he will not want to
00:16:01 return even if they try to judge him
00:16:03 even if they try to do justice
00:16:07 for the crimes he has committed no
00:16:09 so now more people than ever are
00:16:12 asking for a republic that spain
00:16:16 becomes a republic there are more and more
00:16:19 republican people in spain who  He does not
00:16:21 want there to be a monarchy, although for
00:16:24 now none of the majority parties,
00:16:26 at least of the two
00:16:29 largest parties in Spain,'
00:16:32 one of the two asks for the repubblica, asks
00:16:35 that there be no more kings, that there be no more
00:16:38 na monarchy and a royal family
00:16:40 in Spain' and tell me what
00:16:44 you think you believe that
00:16:48 kings and princes if they commit a crime if they
00:16:51 do something illegal they should be judged
00:16:54 as a normal person or not also tell me
00:16:58 in the comments if you believe  in
00:17:01 2020 this year you think it's a good idea to
00:17:05 continue having a monarchy to continue
00:17:08 having kings and well if you like

00:00:17 I think your previous video was very
00:00:20 successful people liked it a lot
00:00:23 [Laughs]
00:00:29 we started recording the same day
00:00:32 but well I'm sure yes I'm
00:00:34 sure  it was very successful and today you are
00:00:39 going to tell us a story
00:00:42 if we really like stories a
00:00:45 story that in my opinion is very
00:00:47 funny it is going to make us laugh you are going
00:00:50 to make us laugh so I hope
00:00:52 so but if I don't normally
00:00:55 consider myself a very  funny not
00:00:58 this story makes me very funny you
00:01:01 laugh yourself I laugh myself well
00:01:04 surely we
00:01:06 laugh too so it is a story that
00:01:09 I have not told many people no and
00:01:12 when I have told someone they have
00:01:14 told me they  they have been stunned they have
00:01:16 not been me if they have not laughed they have not
00:01:21 been surprised because they
00:01:24 were part of the story and you have
00:01:27 told those affected
00:01:30 [Laughter]
00:01:32 then tell us a little a little more
00:01:34 when it happened
00:01:41 I'm not going to close it for a couple of hours it will be
00:01:47 hours but I don't think this is
00:01:49 torment because it's raining well let's
00:01:53 see it's a story that happened to me
00:01:56 when I was very little it was
00:02:00 in 2010 I was 10 years old 10 years 10
00:02:06 years okay  so you were old
00:02:09 enough for three
00:02:12 schoolmates to blame you for what i'm
00:02:16 imagining i don't know if it happened at school or
00:02:19 not so here's the thing this
00:02:23 story is a story of how i
00:02:25 got something i did that was my
00:02:29 fault  to make it not my fault and
00:02:32 that they will blame the rest of the class on the
00:02:35 rest and right or on everything and it didn't hit the mark on
00:02:38 me no it doesn't affect me like that
00:02:46 then this story happened on an
00:02:52 end of year trip ok that is with your
00:02:55 classmates  from school with the teachers
00:02:57 but it took more than 5 hours from the school to the
00:03:00 south of Spain to the park of Doñana like this
00:03:04 because we haven't explained where
00:03:07 you are from and he's from Madrid it's Balañá and the
00:03:12 school you went to was in Madrid
00:03:14 in Madrid
00:03:15 5
00:03:16 And it was this Saturday, nana, which is a
00:03:20 very famous, very beautiful, very large natural park
00:03:24 and it is located in the south of Spain,
00:03:29 and I also remember very well because at
00:03:32 that time the World Cup was held at the World Cup,
00:03:36 this year Spain won
00:03:39 and it is a  Shakira's song
00:03:51 and everyone was with soccer
00:03:54 even though we were 10 years old, Spain is
00:03:57 soccer culture
00:04:00 and so we went there and we went to
00:04:03 a very nice Andalusian-style house
00:04:06 with a central patio and the dining room was
00:04:11 at the back and there was like a second  floor
00:04:16 that was also like a corridor
00:04:19 only with the doors of the
00:04:22 applications and that overlooked the central patio
00:04:25 also a train would be all doors
00:04:29 above on the first floor and on the
00:04:31 second floor as well and you left the
00:04:34 room and saw the direct patio it blocked me
00:04:36 You were in the central patio, yes,
00:04:38 we would meet there to play,
00:04:41 well, have a good time and then, well, I
00:04:45 had one in one of the
00:04:46 rooms below
00:04:50 and the rooms were four
00:04:51 people so I was with three
00:04:53 friends
00:04:56 and the rooms were not very big they
00:04:58 had lines, that is, one bed on top of
00:05:02 the other
00:05:03 and this band one in front of the other that
00:05:06 there was a bunk since there was another well
00:05:09 because sometimes when you go on a
00:05:13 weekend trip  During the course you go to a very large house
00:05:15 with a bedroom with many people in
00:05:18 one room. I don't know if this was not
00:05:21 what an Andalusian house was like, so old, they
00:05:26 were like many, many rooms,
00:05:28 but very small.
00:05:34 A similar hotel, yes, but
00:05:39 for us we were small children
00:05:43 and then, well, the room was very small
00:05:47 and I perfectly remember
00:05:50 that the bathroom the bathroom door was green
00:05:52 green green and it had a hole,
00:05:56 so not a hole.
00:06:02 I go to a sword or to the
00:06:05 hole through the middle of the door and
00:06:09 then we put a handkerchief in the
00:06:11 middle of the door so that it couldn't be seen
00:06:16 and well, we were there I don't know what night
00:06:19 It was I don't know what night it was but one night we
00:06:22 ate lentils
00:06:25 and I don't like lentils I didn't
00:06:26 like them in the past and I still don't
00:06:29 like them no well look they are healthy
00:06:32 for your company yes yes but I don't know I don't
00:06:35 like them you can look at doing it you have a  smell
00:06:39 and like a plate of lentils I
00:06:41 prefer lentils that are thicker
00:06:44 than broths I don't like broths that
00:06:47 much okay and what happened tonight
00:06:52 then well nothing we all went to
00:06:55 bed quietly we were sleeping
00:06:58 we were with we were wearing a
00:07:01 sleeping bag we were  sleeping in our
00:07:03 bunk with the sleeping bag and I
00:07:06 remember that one of the nights we were
00:07:09 fooling around pretending to be
00:07:11 worms inside our sleeping bag
00:07:14 instead of sleeping on these trips it always
00:07:18 happens that you end up going to sleep at
00:07:21 so many no more
00:07:22 either because you are talking to your
00:07:25 friends or actually doing something
00:07:28 later I don't know what time
00:07:30 we would go to sleep but the
00:07:33 next day I wake up
00:07:37 disgusted with an ace  co what is this
00:07:43 because it is my calm on the entire side it
00:07:45 was full full full of lentils
00:07:50 and I thought that someone had come
00:07:52 to play the prank on me and had
00:07:56 thrown lentils at me I was on the
00:07:58 top bunk I had not thrown lentils on top
00:08:01 and the lentils
00:08:04 had also slipped down the wall to the
00:08:06 bottom part, it had reached your
00:08:09 partner below with the honey if simply when
00:08:12 talking the lentils had not been put on
00:08:14 top of that but it did not smell for
00:08:20 example of vomit or something not  there was no
00:08:22 vomiting it was just lentils and
00:08:25 who was it who was it then
00:08:27 we called the teachers we called
00:08:31 everyone the rest of the students because
00:08:34 we were students in three courses they will be the
00:08:36 students of 9, 10 and 11 years old to come back a lot I
00:08:41 thought it had been one  one of the older ones
00:08:43 who had played a joke on us hadn't
00:08:45 thrown lentils on us there was
00:08:47 someone who knew you didn't like
00:08:50 lentils
00:08:53 but hey why not
00:09:00 [Music]
00:09:02 then well everyone
00:09:06 my  friends in my room also super
00:09:08 indignant how could
00:09:11 someone have texted someone because they did it to you
00:09:15 because the doors didn't
00:09:18 lock or from the inside or something
00:09:21 I think I don't don't remember very
00:09:23 well but I don't think so  Because in the event
00:09:26 of an accident, the
00:09:28 teachers had to have easy access,
00:09:31 they had to be able to enter to help them
00:09:35 and we called the teachers and the
00:09:38 teachers put all the students
00:09:41 in the central patio and began to
00:09:43 ask very carefully who it was
00:09:49 and  no one no one stops their teachers
00:09:52 they look good in very strict lives no no
00:09:56 but the breathing was clear they became
00:09:59 serious and clear and asking
00:10:02 who it was and no one answered
00:10:04 then they said
00:10:07 very well you are all punished
00:10:11 until they say who is guilty
00:10:15 So the days went by punishing everyone,
00:10:17 they didn't know they were guilty
00:10:22 and the last day we were on the bus
00:10:25 to go back to Madrid all together and well
00:10:30 we were talking to each other.  e people and
00:10:32 we were saying in the end the culprit has not been found it has
00:10:34 never been
00:10:37 known who was the culprit who could have
00:10:39 been
00:10:41 and it was at that moment when I had a
00:10:45 momentary flashback
00:10:50 I remembered the one who was here just the
00:10:54 best I stop yes in  In the depths of
00:10:57 my mind I remembered that
00:11:02 at night all of a sudden I only
00:11:05 remembered that I made this gesture it's as if I
00:11:07 got up suddenly
00:11:10 and then I did what I had to do and
00:11:13 I went back to sleep so they are calm well
00:11:18 then I stopped
00:11:20 without an appointment me
00:11:22 and I have vomited everything that I had in
00:11:27 my stomach
00:11:29 and the rest of the class has been blamed
00:11:31 and indeed it gives me that obviously that
00:11:35 is what happened because then I remembered that
00:11:38 indeed there was something like my stomach
00:11:40 was not feeling very well  It makes
00:11:41 sense because I don't
00:11:44 love lentils and well
00:11:48 years later this was obviously on the
00:11:50 bus I didn't tell anyone I
00:11:54 didn't say a word
00:11:57 and I didn't tell anyone so
00:11:59 we went back to Madrid nobody knew who
00:12:01 had been  or no one knew who it had
00:12:04 been and the next day not the next day
00:12:08 in a few years
00:12:11 I told him I think some of my friends
00:12:14 who were in the same room well
00:12:17 it hadn't been it had been me and he
00:12:21 says no seriously you can't see
00:12:27 so to me it is a story that makes me
00:12:29 very funny yes it is very surprising
00:12:32 oysters I did not imagine a little
00:12:36 where it could have come from but well
00:12:39 because he declared you had given me clues
00:12:41 you had already told us that it had been
00:12:44 your fault and such
00:12:48 but  yes not because normally it is easy to
00:12:51 tell these vomit it is not clearly it
00:12:53 smells like vomiting and it did not smell vomit it
00:12:56 was nothing behind lentils I do not know I
00:13:00 would not have digested them they did not simply
00:13:03 do them or inside and for fort
00:13:08 and your body perhaps as a self-defense mechanism well
00:13:18 yes yes yes it is a story a
00:13:21 surprising story
00:13:24 if I had had the same thing
00:13:27 happen to me I might have also
00:13:30 waited a few years before
00:13:31 [Laughter] can
00:13:35 you imagine that you had said it I
00:13:37 would have said hey pr  ofe but I
00:13:40 'm sorry no one I don't know how the teacher would have looked at me
00:13:44 if I had said it if you
00:13:48 had said it the morning that same
00:13:51 morning maybe if you hadn't said it on the
00:13:53 bus back it would have been the
00:13:55 worst and that was when I remembered in the
00:13:59 bus
00:14:00 imagine that I had said it on the
00:14:02 bus I would have been killed by everyone
00:14:04 on the bus it would have been the worst
00:14:06 because they had just swallowed all the
00:14:09 punishment of every day of the trip I
00:14:11 have not even been able to enjoy it
00:14:18 is that it is an automatic reaction that
00:14:21 we have  Sometimes,
00:14:22 even if it is unconscious, blaming someone else
00:14:28 when something bad happens to you, for example,
00:14:31 this also happened a lot in class.
00:14:34 The pencil case had been lost, no, you don't
00:14:37 say, I lost the pencil case, you say,
00:14:40 the pencil case was stolen.
00:14:46 It's my fault it's not me I
00:14:50 lost it it's you I stole it where it is
00:14:53 and you find it it was inside your
00:14:56 drawer and you say ah sorry it's like
00:15:01 you've known me tobacco no
00:15:06 yes we like to think that  well that the
00:15:08 culprits are others and not ourselves
00:15:13 I would say that it is a very Spanish behavior to
00:15:18 be the same I don't know I don't know if it
00:15:22 could not be I don't know if there are other societies
00:15:26 other cultures that tend more to accept
00:15:30 their defects
00:15:34 than  Seeing is a very human behavior,
00:15:38 very human,
00:15:40 but I would say that in Spain
00:15:45 we always try to blame
00:15:48 others, it
00:15:50 could be, there are cultures that are
00:15:52 perhaps more humble and where the
00:15:55 first reaction is to ask for forgiveness,
00:16:01 well, thank you very much.  for telling us
00:16:04 your story
00:16:06 so it has been a very
00:16:08 funny story maybe when I know when your
00:16:12 classmates the rest of the
00:16:13 classmates see the video they will tell you
00:16:16 Laura
00:16:18 you owe us days of travel
00:16:23 but hey I have good memories of that
00:16:25 trip being part of this
00:16:30 were even though  this for me is also a
00:16:32 good memory it is a funny memory it is
00:16:35 something now yes now you can tell it and
00:16:38 laugh not calmly if most
00:16:41 of the stories are like that in the  moment maybe
00:16:44 you had a bad time but then you
00:16:47 can tell it and you laugh at the stories
00:16:51 the moments that are bad in the future
00:16:55 when you look back are stories
00:16:58 that you usually laugh at as
00:17:00 long as someone did not die if
00:17:05 something excessively bad happened to them something
00:17:07 irreversible no  I know, thank you very much and
00:17:13 I hope you come back again
00:17:16 of course remember us the name of
00:17:19 your channel that's right after hours if I leave you
00:17:25 a link below in the description in case
00:17:27 you want to see the videos of the work okay

00:00:05 Hello, in a recent video about the
00:00:10 history of Spain, we talked about the
00:00:14 Austrians, the Austrian dynasty,
00:00:18 a dynasty of kings and queens, and
00:00:22 within this dynasty there was
00:00:27 Felipe Felipe Segundo, and today we are going to go
00:00:32 back a bit.  To explain a story
00:00:37 of the life of Felipe Segundo,
00:00:42 as we said, Felipe Segundo was the son of
00:00:47 Carlos Primero, there was no king, Carlos
00:00:52 Primero, and Felipe Segundo was his son, and
00:00:57 after Felipe Segundo, the next
00:01:01 king was Felipe
00:01:05 Tercero, Felipe Tercero, but Felipe Tercero.  It
00:01:11 was not the first son of Felipe Segundo, it
00:01:15 was not his first son, his first
00:01:19 son, no, no,
00:01:22 Felipe Segundo had had a
00:01:25 son before and today I am going to tell you an
00:01:29 interesting story about the life of this son.
00:01:34 So, as I already explained, Felipe
00:01:39 Segundo continued.  fighting fighting for the
00:01:43 possessions of spain in europe
00:01:48 the possessions in europe
00:01:51 holland not the holy empire for
00:01:55 catholicism for catholicism fighting
00:02:00 against the lutherans not and on  He went well
00:02:05 conquering the Americas in the new
00:02:08 world so the first son of Philip the
00:02:12 second was called Carlos yes he did have
00:02:17 another son named Carlos he did
00:02:21 not become king he was a prince he was the prince
00:02:24 he was not born in 1545 if he is normally
00:02:31 called prince carlos  from austria yes
00:02:35 because he was from the austrian family
00:02:37 carlos already had many
00:02:41 health problems when he was little he had problems i
00:02:46 don't know he had a fever quite often he
00:02:49 had a fever it seems he had
00:02:52 genetic problems problems in the
00:02:55 genes problems in the dna not that
00:02:59 good  Quite a few people in his family
00:03:03 had because their ancestors their parents
00:03:07 grandparents and such had married a lot
00:03:12 between cousins ​​being relatives being from
00:03:15 the same family having the same
00:03:17 grandparents for example in fact Carlos
00:03:22 had malaria when he was little he was sick with
00:03:25 malaria and that made him limp  that he
00:03:29 was limping that he walked he did not walk
00:03:33 well he could not walk well no and it seems
00:03:36 that he also had some
00:03:40 health problems m  ental had
00:03:44 head problems no in fact too old in
00:03:47 his early twenties
00:03:50 carlos felt that his father didn't trust
00:03:54 him he didn't give him responsibilities he didn't
00:03:58 give him power and carlos tried to
00:04:03 join the dutch rebels with
00:04:07 the dutch who were fighting
00:04:09 against his  father but they caught him they caught him
00:04:15 his father locked him up
00:04:18 but in the hills and carlos refused to eat he
00:04:23 said he wasn't going to eat and because he didn't eat
00:04:27 he died yes he died at 23 at
00:04:33 23 he died and of course felipe
00:04:39 second got very  sad he became very sad and he
00:04:43 was worried he was worried
00:04:46 because he had no son no
00:04:50 son had only daughters and for
00:04:55 many years he did not have any son
00:04:58 until many years later that he would have
00:05:02 felipe the third no
00:05:04 but today I want to tell you a story
00:05:09 of when  carlos was little when he was a
00:05:12 child
00:05:13 and believe it or not i heard this story
00:05:18 on a podcast a podcast from the usa an
00:05:22 american podcast yes its called
00:05:26 radio la radio la no qu  It's a
00:05:29 very, very interesting podcast, it's in English, it's in
00:05:33 English, that's why I don't recommend
00:05:35 that you listen to it, I recommend that
00:05:38 you listen to Spanish, no, but it's very
00:05:41 interesting, and today I've
00:05:44 started to investigate this story, to investigate a
00:05:48 little more to find out what  it happened that it had
00:05:52 happened or not and it is the story of when
00:05:56 carlos was 17 years old he was 17 years old he was
00:06:03 17 years old at 17 years old carlos
00:06:08 was at home he
00:06:11 was chasing a maid one of
00:06:14 the maids in his house was
00:06:16 chasing her and she fell down  the stairs
00:06:19 he fell he hit his head and
00:06:24 well he hurt his head
00:06:27 and at first it seems that nothing was happening
00:06:32 but his head began to hurt more and
00:06:36 more he began to feel bad and it got
00:06:41 really bad  his head became
00:06:44 sore it became inflamed his eye became inflamed he
00:06:49 couldn't open it he couldn't open it because it
00:06:51 was swollen or not all inflamed
00:06:55 and he began to have delusions he
00:06:59 didn't know what he was saying no one
00:07:02 understood what he was saying  when not
00:07:05 then his father his worried father
00:07:10 came to see him he came to see his son and they
00:07:13 called the best doctors the
00:07:17 best doctors in Spain and Europe
00:07:19 they called them and the doctors began to
00:07:24 try many things they tried many
00:07:27 ways to cure him
00:07:31 well wait  I'm going to get him out of jail
00:07:34 because here Carlos no he wasn't
00:07:38 in jail yet he wasn't locked up he was
00:07:41 in bed no so the doctors
00:07:46 made a hole
00:07:49 in his head they made a hole in his skull yes yes
00:07:53 but still he didn't get better  He did not get
00:07:57 better and the doctors thought that Carlos
00:08:01 was going to die, yes he was going to die,
00:08:04 so his father, Felipe Segundo, made a
00:08:08 pact with God, he asked God for something
00:08:12 and brought the relics of a monk, the
00:08:18 relics of Diego, Diego de  Alcalá
00:08:23 Diego de Alcalá was a monk, not a
00:08:26 religious person,
00:08:28 the relics are the corpse when the
00:08:32 person dies, not because the
00:08:36 corpse remains, the bones remain, the bones of
00:08:41 the person, and if it was an
00:08:44 important person for  It wasn't religion because at this
00:08:49 time people prayed they asked for
00:08:52 things from the bones of this person,
00:08:57 this monk or this priest and this was
00:09:00 Diego Diego de Alcalá Alcalá Alcalá is
00:09:04 a city
00:09:06 near Madrid Alcalá de Henares for I
00:09:10 don't know why  central spain
00:09:12 alcalá de henares
00:09:15 and is called diego de alcalá because diego
00:09:19 died he died in alcalá de henares he lived
00:09:22 the last years of his life in alcalá
00:09:25 but this diego would later
00:09:30 name him a saint the father of the
00:09:34 vatican would name him a saint and he became saint
00:09:38 Diego, yes, San Diego himself, from the city of
00:09:43 San Diego, in California, in the USA, then
00:09:49 Felipe Segundo brought the bones, brought
00:09:54 Diego's skeleton, brought the skeleton
00:09:59 and it is not very clear, it is not very clear if
00:10:03 he put the skeleton next to the bed
00:10:06 or at the  feet or he put it next to carlos
00:10:10 he put it here on the bed together with carlos
00:10:13 it's not very clear but well he brought the
00:10:17 skeleton into the room and asked him for a
00:10:21 miracle he asked him to save his
00:10:24 son no and it seems that car  the carlos touched
00:10:30 and touched the skeleton he touched the relics
00:10:34 of diego de alcalá and with his hand with the
00:10:39 same hand he passed it over his face like this
00:10:44 and felipe asked god for a miracle and
00:10:49 said he would return it to him if he did
00:10:53 a miracle for  he he would do a very big thing he
00:10:56 would also do a miracle for
00:11:00 god's sake then keep one thing in mind
00:11:04 this time was a time when in the
00:11:10 catholic church in the
00:11:13 vatican church you could pay for salvation
00:11:16 you could pay money to take away your
00:11:19 sins no and  you could pay money so
00:11:24 that other people prayed for you they
00:11:27 will pray for your salvation so that
00:11:31 you would go to heaven and not go to
00:11:33 hell and in fact it was one of the
00:11:37 reasons why martin luther martin
00:11:41 luther had started Lutheranism
00:11:44 or Protestantism
00:11:46 and well  and in fact, felipe segundo was
00:11:51 fighting against this against these
00:11:54 ideas to continue with the catholic religion, the
00:11:58 same as up to now,
00:12:01 so felipe segundo asked god for a
00:12:04 miracle and later  he left he left
00:12:09 the room the room where
00:12:12 carlos was a felipe second he left because he
00:12:17 didn't want to see his son die of course but
00:12:21 that night carlos slept well he slept
00:12:26 well for the first time after many
00:12:30 days he got better every day he
00:12:35 got better after  One week the
00:12:39 inflammation had already gone down and I
00:12:42 could see I could see
00:12:44 and after a month it had
00:12:48 already recovered and it was perfect as if
00:12:51 nothing had ever happened and well everyone
00:12:56 thought it was a miracle from Diego or
00:13:00 not from San Diego
00:13:03 now they think  It was probably
00:13:07 because they made a hole in his
00:13:10 skull that relieved the pressure on his
00:13:14 skull, but at this time, of course, they
00:13:17 thought it was because of San Diego. In addition, he
00:13:22 told Carlos that at night he had
00:13:26 had a dream, he had dreamed of a monk,
00:13:30 a monk.  without hair who came
00:13:34 and spoke to him and the monk had told him that he
00:13:39 would be fine that he would get better
00:13:41 then of course everyone thought that
00:13:44 that monk would have been Diego de Alcalá
00:13:48 then  Felipe Segundo felt that he
00:13:54 owed something to God that he had to
00:13:57 return the favor to God that he had
00:14:00 to repay God. Can't imagine if
00:14:04 you were Felipe
00:14:07 Segundo you thought that your son was leaving
00:14:10 but suddenly your son is normal, he
00:14:13 's perfect then  One of the things
00:14:17 that Felipe Segundo did was ask his
00:14:21 father, the Pope in the Vatican in Rome, to
00:14:24 ask him to name Diego de Alcalá
00:14:28 as a saint. They had already asked him a few
00:14:31 times, but Felipe Segundo insisted
00:14:34 more and in the end he managed to get them to name
00:14:38 Diego de Alcalá  like saint like san
00:14:40 diego
00:14:43 another thing that seems to be that he did although
00:14:46 it is not it is not very clear exactly no
00:14:50 it is not written anywhere that he
00:14:52 really was the one who asked for it
00:14:55 but it seems that he also asked for
00:14:59 a mechanical version of san
00:15:03 diego to be built a  robot not
00:15:06 at that time they were called automata
00:15:09 an automaton is like a robot made with
00:15:14 watch parts like watches he did not
00:15:19 ask them to build this robot here
00:15:22 you can see  er the robot is a robot 40
00:15:26 centimeters 40 centimeters high and
00:15:31 was made by a watchmaker a person a
00:15:34 man who was in charge of building
00:15:38 and fixing watches
00:15:40 the watchmaker Juanelo Turriano Juanelo
00:15:44 Turriano a great watchmaker and this person
00:15:48 was the king's engineer he worked  for
00:15:51 the king and this part of the story
00:15:56 is not clear yes he this person is
00:16:01 known to have worked for the king we
00:16:04 are not 100% sure that this automaton
00:16:08 was built by turriano but it seems that it
00:16:12 is most likely and also this robot
00:16:16 the automaton his  face looks like
00:16:19 san diego images to san diego images
00:16:23 left from that time but
00:16:26 not only that
00:16:27 the robot still exists now it
00:16:31 still works you can still wind it up and
00:16:35 the robot moves yes yes
00:16:57 four hundred years later after
00:17:01 400  years after it was built and now it
00:17:05 's in washington it's in washington dc
00:17:08 at the at the svyt smithsonian at the
00:17:13 smithsonian museum in washington if it
00:17:16 can still be seen now then when  or you
00:17:19 wind it up you wind up the robot
00:17:22 the robot walks walks its head
00:17:26 turns its eyes move it moves its mouth the
00:17:32 mouth moves it moves its arms and in its hand it
00:17:37 has a cross
00:17:39 not a Christian cross
00:17:42 and the table brings it to its lips  He
00:17:46 approaches her lips, kisses her to the cross and
00:17:49 then changes direction and
00:17:52 repeats the same thing again, doing the squares,
00:17:56 not if it's a prayer
00:18:01 machine, a machine to pray to God, a machine to
00:18:04 ask God for things, it's like the perfect
00:18:09 Christian does not always repeat exactly the
00:18:12 same ideal way of praying and the
00:18:17 mechanism all the parts are inside were
00:18:20 not visible because he was dressed in a
00:18:23 tunic with the clothes of a monk no and
00:18:28 well it is not very clear but it is said that
00:18:32 Felipe Segundo did this for  help
00:18:36 Catholicism to
00:18:39 and distribute to the world not the
00:18:43 perfect way to pray to save yourself,
00:18:47 your own family
00:18:49 and others, teaching the whole
00:18:53 world the perfect way to pray
00:18:55 to be a perfect Catholic and that's it
00:18:59 this is the story of carlos first
00:19:03 of the robot of carlos first
00:19:07 and well tell me if you liked it if
00:19:10 you liked this story write it in
00:19:12 the comments and in the next video
00:19:17 the next story video will
00:19:20 also be more or less from this time but it
00:19:23 is  a song that you do not expect and well if you
00:19:28 think you know it, then writing it
00:19:30 below is worth goodbye

156,"00:00:00 Hello guys, how are you once again, your

00:00:07 see today we are in the kitchen that
00:00:10 means that we are going to prepare another
00:00:13 recipe and today's recipe
00:00:17 has avocado protein and a little bit of
00:00:21 vegetable so you are going to love it we are going
00:00:23 to start the first thing to do to
00:00:25 wash your hands well guys right
00:00:34 now I am going to explain what
00:00:35 ingredients we are going to need for
00:00:37 our incredible and delicious recipe
00:00:39 I have to tell you that I have a
00:00:42 tenant a person who is  here in
00:00:44 the house that doesn't eat fish so
00:00:48 that's why I have to make a small change if
00:00:51 you don't eat fish well you
00:00:54 don't like any of that I have an option if you're vegan
00:00:57 sorry I don't have an option but I
00:00:59 'll tell you in a little while  Let's go with
00:01:01 the ingredients so what we are
00:01:04 going to need we are going to make portions ok
00:01:06 this is for five portions but per
00:01:09 portion we are going to use half and a half
00:01:13 tomato ok half half how  o I'm going to
00:01:16 make five portions, that's why I have two
00:01:18 tomatoes and a half, we're going to
00:01:22 also need avocado, I hope you have it in your
00:01:25 city, in your country, because it's delicious.
00:01:34 we are going to occupy a
00:01:37 quarter of the avocado ok we are going to need
00:01:40 onion this onion was already split
00:01:43 so we are going to use it it can be
00:01:45 white onion if you prefer or any
00:01:48 other that you like okay for those who
00:01:50 eat meat we are going to use here is
00:01:53 the  fish we call it tilapia fish
00:01:59 and for our tenant who doesn't eat
00:02:02 meat we're going to use he doesn't eat fish
00:02:04 sorry we're going to use chicken good
00:02:07 guys and another ingredient look I don't know if
00:02:09 you have it in your city in your
00:02:11 country in your continent I don't know  Yes, it exists,
00:02:14 but if not, I'm going to give you something that you
00:02:18 can use instead of the ingredient
00:02:21 for what we are going to use are these
00:02:25 that we have here, which are rice cakes.
00:02:27 I don't know if you have seen them.  This, but they are
00:02:30 normally used by
00:02:32 people who are fit when they have
00:02:35 nothing to eat for free, the dead ones are
00:02:38 these, well, they are made of brown
00:02:41 rice or rice and well, you can
00:02:44 put little things on top, such as almond cream,
00:02:47 I don't know, tomato web, let's go with
00:02:52 they if you do not have that ingredient you
00:02:54 can substitute it for this the
00:02:57 ingredient is
00:02:58 tostadas in mexico we use a
00:03:01 lot of tostadas that are tostadas made of
00:03:04 corn ok that is like the one you
00:03:07 use look with this one but not this
00:03:11 way this is magic for popcorn
00:03:13 the  The corn that is used there is a corn
00:03:16 that is in the corn plantations, they
00:03:19 are super big and well, they are
00:03:21 made there
00:03:23 like the tortilla.
00:03:32 make tacos with
00:03:35 these they make tostadas if you have them
00:03:37 incredible if you don't have them you can
00:03:39 use the rice cakes to
00:03:41 go with the dry ingredients that
00:03:43 we are going to need  itar to be able to give that
00:03:45 rich flavor to our fish and in
00:03:48 our chicken
00:03:49 we are going to use salt primarily of
00:03:52 course this Himalayan salt is
00:03:56 not on the brand this is rossa salt and we are going
00:04:00 to use it instead of conventional salt
00:04:02 which is white salt
00:04:04 We are also going to use a little bit of
00:04:06 oregano. You have already seen this, I hope
00:04:09 you know it if you do not recognize the name. It is
00:04:12 this type of plant that gives an
00:04:14 incredible essence and flavor to the food
00:04:17 and finally we are going to use
00:04:20 ground black pepper, whether  You grind it
00:04:23 or buy it, that's the way it is
00:04:25 and we're also going now with the things the
00:04:28 materials we're going to need are the
00:04:31 following on this side we have
00:04:34 the dishes as I told you I'm going to prepare
00:04:36 5 portions because we are five people
00:04:39 in the family if you are  Don't
00:04:41 worry, I'm going to prepare portion by
00:04:43 portion. We also need here because
00:04:46 this is like a griddle.
00:04:52 occupy other
00:04:56 separate pans to be able to make
00:04:58 our tomato and onion and we are going to
00:05:01 need a chopping board of
00:05:03 course a knife these knives are
00:05:06 incredible if you are from brazil thank you
00:05:09 brazilians they are very very good they have lasted
00:05:12 many years and they cut incredible without
00:05:15 sharpening we have here  also the table
00:05:17 that we are going to use a
00:05:19 mixing spoon can be different we are going to use
00:05:22 our spatula to be able to move
00:05:26 all the casseroles
00:05:28 and on this side we have some small plates there are
00:05:31 five small plates because we are going to make
00:05:32 five different portions and last but not
00:05:36 least we are going to use  What is our
00:05:38 spray going to do to help us prevent
00:05:43 our tomato from our onion from sticking to our fish? The
00:05:45 first thing we have to do is
00:05:47 start with our tomatoes.
00:05:52 this way
00:05:55 ok so that we have them in half each
00:05:58 person has to consume half ok
00:06:01 I don't know if I remember  Dan, I told them
00:06:04 that right now I am in a fit challenge with my
00:06:07 family to lose weight and have a
00:06:09 better diet, because this is part
00:06:11 of the challenge, so we are going to cut each
00:06:14 one, they can cut it into slices so
00:06:19 we can't cut it into small squares.  I
00:06:22 really recommend it this way because you
00:06:25 will see in a moment why
00:06:27 later we are going to put them in our
00:06:30 container and we are going to do that with
00:06:33 all the tomatoes that we have here
00:06:35 as you can see guys we already have
00:06:37 all our tomatoes cut and
00:06:40 now  We are going to put it in our purple onion.
00:06:42 I want to tell you that this
00:06:45 time one of our tenants
00:06:48 who does not eat fish does not want onions and does
00:06:52 not like onions so we are going to
00:06:54 do this without onions so that they
00:06:55 realize that everything can be done with this
00:06:57 recipe.  So we are going to cut it, I
00:07:00 recommend that you cut it so that it
00:07:03 is again in slices or in
00:07:05 bigger pieces so that it gives it a richer flavor.
00:07:07 Ok, here we have our new one.  stra
00:07:10 cut onion ok it's a bit if you want more
00:07:12 put the one you want and
00:07:15 we're going to grab a fist if we
00:07:17 're going to put our onion in
00:07:19 our different containers ok
00:07:22 since this person doesn't like onion we
00:07:25 're not going to put onion but yes to  The
00:07:27 rest of us are passionate
00:07:29 about eating onions, we already have our
00:07:32 tomatoes with onions and one without onions,
00:07:35 and what we have to do right now is
00:07:38 just put
00:07:41 our stove or all our
00:07:43 pans to preheat, so we are going to learn
00:07:46 each one of them.  of them the fire is low ok low
00:07:50 because if the onion is not going to burn
00:07:51 then we all have to
00:07:54 season our tomato and
00:07:56 onion for that we are only going to
00:07:59 use a little bit of salt
00:08:05 and we are also going to use a little bit of
00:08:08 ground black pepper let's go  to put
00:08:11 all the people who are going to eat
00:08:14 love it so there is no problem we can
00:08:17 put whatever we create without
00:08:19 exaggerating once we  and we have already done this
00:08:22 we are now going to put it in our sprite
00:08:23 in our pans that are already
00:08:26 hot to be able to make our
00:08:29 vegetables our next step once
00:08:32 we have put the spri in our pans
00:08:34 we are going to put and empty our
00:08:37 onion preparations with tomato in
00:08:41 our pan to  that we are going to use
00:08:43 our spatula and the quarters
00:08:48 in which our tomato is on the
00:08:51 fire we are going to start with the toasts
00:08:53 look these are the toasts they are very
00:08:55 thin but they are hard it is not like a
00:08:58 tortilla that folds easily we are going to
00:09:01 make the avocado  I said that we are going to
00:09:03 occupy a
00:09:06 quarter of an avocado per recipe, which means a
00:09:08 quarter, look how an avocado opens
00:09:11 if you have never opened it in your life, we cut,
00:09:14 we turn,
00:09:19 we make this movement:
00:09:21 equality, we have the avocado open,
00:09:25 now we are going to cut it into a quarter  ok
00:09:28 these are pieces of a quarter of
00:09:30 another avocado but for you to see I want
00:09:32 you to realize we are going to cut this
00:09:35 in half
00:09:37 and ah  Yes, we have a quarter of avocado,
00:09:42 as you can see, we only have 1 2 3 4
00:09:45 4 parts of avocado 4 quarters of
00:09:49 avocado because one of the tenants,
00:09:52 one of the people who is going to eat,
00:09:54 does not eat avocados either, and the person who
00:09:58 did not want onions told me  he didn't want fish he
00:10:01 doesn't want avocado either so we're going to
00:10:04 prepare our toast here we have it
00:10:06 and what we're going to do is just
00:10:09 cut little pieces in our avocado ok
00:10:12 listen well we have to distribute
00:10:15 this part of avocado for two toasts
00:10:19 ok don't finish everything here for the two
00:10:22 toast  The next thing we are going to do
00:10:24 so that our fish are on
00:10:26 time and nothing gets cold, we are going to
00:10:28 open them and we are going to put them
00:10:33 on the fire, we are going to put our fish fillets on the fire, then we are
00:10:37 going to get high
00:10:39 and it is very hot.
00:10:44 We are going to put our seasonings I don't know
00:10:47 if you hear me because the fire is a little
00:10:49 strong but we are going to put
00:10:52 our oregano on top a little
00:10:54 depending on the g
00:10:59 Now we are going to put a little bit of pepper
00:11:01 to give it another little flavor
00:11:04 to put it on the top
00:11:09 and less importantly the salt,
00:11:14 our tomato is still on the fire,
00:11:16 we are going to put our chicken now,
00:11:19 what we are going to do is take not all
00:11:21 this  chicken and we are going to use a little bit,
00:11:23 not much nor as little as a
00:11:26 fist ok not so big but that's good
00:11:30 now we are going to put the seasoning on
00:11:32 our chicken we are not going to put
00:11:33 oregano because this client does not
00:11:36 like oregano so we are going to
00:11:38 put it  salt
00:11:40 and we are going to put
00:11:45 enough pepper this client
00:11:47 loves pepper right
00:11:49 ok and right now that we have these two
00:11:52 in our hands we are going to put it on
00:11:54 top of our avocado toast
00:11:57 so we are going to put pepper pepper
00:12:01 on each and every one of them  we are going to
00:12:04 put pepper
00:12:06 and now we are going to put the salt on top
00:12:09 because avocado without salt is not a
00:12:11 delicious avocado
00:12:15 now we are going to put our fish on the
00:12:18 other side and  We also have
00:12:20 to move our chicken because if we don't
00:12:22 move it more, but it can
00:12:24 easily brown now we are going to
00:12:27 turn our fish very
00:12:30 carefully
00:12:31 [Music]
00:12:32 like everything if it is hot we are going to
00:12:34 use the help of our friend the
00:12:37 monkey hello well we are going to grab
00:12:40 our frying pan with great care I
00:12:43 do not move with the left and with the right
00:12:44 so we turn
00:12:46 off our frying pan on this side with
00:12:50 zero heat and as you can see here we already have
00:12:53 another of our tomatoes we are going to empty
00:12:57 this
00:12:59 the tomato without onion
00:13:02 and we make  the same with our other
00:13:08 one once we have our protein
00:13:10 here warming up and getting to know each other we are going to
00:13:13 take our tomato and we are going to
00:13:15 put it on our toasts we are going to
00:13:18 grab this tomato that has nothing
00:13:20 like seeing all these delicious toasts
00:13:23 with avocado and they are all simple  and a
00:13:25 joke with nothing to be desired, we are going to put
00:13:29 our tomato on
00:13:32 top of this, the truth is that I do not fancy
00:13:34 it, I prefer it with avocado  If you
00:13:37 also don't like it, well, you don't lose
00:13:39 much and we're going to take the others that
00:13:42 do have onions like this and see how
00:13:45 delicious this looks with roasted onion and its
00:13:51 tomato. We're going to do the same with
00:13:54 all the things we have.  here we go
00:13:56 on what our protein is cheese
00:13:59 says here yes ok they didn't miss it
00:14:01 so we're going to burn move your
00:14:03 chickens and with the chicken if you don't eat any
00:14:06 protein none of that change them
00:14:09 nothing happens let's go here I want you
00:14:11 show off
00:14:13 Mexican sauces because they have been made
00:14:15 here and because they are delicious and we are going
00:14:18 to accompany it with this from hamás at this
00:14:21 table we already have three types of sauces
00:14:23 one day we are going to make sauces together
00:14:27 so you can see how they are made they are easy
00:14:30 and more to make if  You don't like chili

00:14:34 less spicy, okay, look at this incredible sauce,
00:14:37 look at this, the color is
00:14:40 incredible,
00:14:42 we're going to put our sauces on top of

00:14:50 to turn off our game because our

216,"00:00:00 In the first video that we published about
00:00:03 the history of Spain, we talked about the
00:00:08 civil war of
00:00:12 1936. I don't know if you have seen it, but if you
00:00:17 have seen it, you will know that
00:00:21 there was a civil war in 1936, but how did we get
00:00:24 to this situation? What was happening in Spain?
00:00:28 what was the situation for us to
00:00:31 get to war in this video
00:00:35 I am going to explain it
00:00:38 to
00:00:39 [Music]
00:00:42 hello well yes if you remember the last
00:00:47 video in the last video I explained that
00:00:51 alfonso 13 alfonso 13 left
00:00:56 spain he left spain  and in
00:01:00 1931 the second republic began, the
00:01:05 second spanish republic and at that
00:01:09 time the government was niceto
00:01:13 alcalá zamora
00:01:15 then in madrid in the capital
00:01:19 the different political parties
00:01:22 that represent the different
00:01:24 ideologies the different ways of
00:01:27 thinking in spain meet to form a government
00:01:31 temporary for two months until
00:01:34 elections are held until the people
00:01:36 can vote and choose the government but
00:01:40 during this time of temporary government
00:01:43 it is already em  They begin to make some reforms
00:01:47 some changes and one of these changes
00:01:50 is secular education non-
00:01:55 religious education is taking away from the church the
00:01:59 role of educator that it had until now
00:02:02 then this angers the church and
00:02:06 some members of the church begin
00:02:09 to ask for it to return  to alfonso 13 that
00:02:13 the monarchy returns then in June
00:02:17 1931 the elections arrive, the people go to
00:02:22 vote and the socialists are elected
00:02:25 not the party of the left the party
00:02:28 of the workers and the
00:02:31 radical republicans the party that was
00:02:34 totally against the monarchy
00:02:36 totally  against the king and these two
00:02:40 parties that won decide to create a
00:02:43 constitution a constitution that
00:02:47 was not supported by the right by the
00:02:50 most traditionalist parties of the right
00:02:53 and in this constitution there were articles
00:02:58 that recalled the rights of the
00:03:01 church
00:03:02 so this results in a crisis
00:03:06 problems  for the government and alcalá
00:03:09 zamora limit has to resign stops
00:03:12 being president and  Manuel Azaña arrives and
00:03:17 Haza forms a government with the
00:03:20 socialists with the
00:03:23 workers' party but this leaves out the
00:03:27 radical republican party
00:03:30 the iron party then the
00:03:33 radical republican party although it was a
00:03:37 republican party was right wing it was
00:03:41 quite right wing and this government the
00:03:44 government  Manuel Azaña has a lot of
00:03:47 opposition, he has opposition from Lerroux and
00:03:51 also opposition from
00:03:53 the anarchists and the communists of
00:03:57 the parties that were even more to
00:04:00 the left of the socialist party.
00:04:04 So, during the two years that Manuel
00:04:07 Azaña was in government, yes,
00:04:10 there were important reforms.
00:04:13 There were important changes in the agrarian reform with
00:04:18 the agrarian reform it was sought that the
00:04:20 ownership of the land
00:04:22 was better distributed, it was not
00:04:25 in the hands of a few and
00:04:29 lands were expropriated, lands were taken from some
00:04:32 large owners,
00:04:34 compensating not compensating them by
00:04:36 giving them money in exchange for the land
00:04:39 they had lost then they procl  he
00:04:42 also loved the autonomy of catalonia it was
00:04:46 proclaimed that catalonia catalonia would be an
00:04:50 autonomous community within spain it
00:04:52 would have some autonomy it would have the
00:04:55 capacity to make decisions it
00:04:59 would have some freedom to
00:05:02 choose how it was administered no but with
00:05:05 all the pressures it received the
00:05:09 situation is evolving the world is
00:05:12 changing  socialist party the socialist party
00:05:15 is the psoe not the
00:05:18 spanish socialist workers party
00:05:20 the socialists are beginning to think about whether
00:05:24 or not it is a good idea to continue in the government
00:05:28 because the government is beginning to radicalize more and more
00:05:31 to the left it is
00:05:34 beginning to go to the left but the
00:05:37 anarchists who  they were even more on the
00:05:39 left they
00:05:40 hated the socialists because they were
00:05:45 in the government they were part of the
00:05:47 government so at this time
00:05:50 more political parties are also appearing on the right
00:05:53 the silk
00:05:57 Spanish confederation of autonomous right-wing is
00:06:01 a congregation of
00:06:03 parties that defends the religion of
00:06:06 fert defends the  order and want
00:06:09 e  eliminate democracy they want there to be
00:06:12 no democracy also
00:06:15 Spanish renewal this was the most
00:06:17 monarchical party they wanted the
00:06:20 king to return and there the phalanx the Spanish phalanx
00:06:23 that it was the most radical who
00:06:26 really wanted to use punishment
00:06:30 so that everything would work well
00:06:33 organized and seeing that
00:06:37 society increasingly begins to become
00:06:39 more radicalized Manuel Azaña also
00:06:43 resigns, he also leaves the government and
00:06:45 then in
00:06:47 1933
00:06:49 there are elections again and this time he
00:06:54 wins to silk with the radical
00:07:00 party the radical party of lerroux and at this
00:07:03 time the  The left is very much
00:07:07 in favor of this result of the
00:07:10 election result and they are preparing to make a
00:07:14 revolution so this government annuls
00:07:18 many of the reforms the
00:07:22 agrarian reform they stop continuing with the
00:07:25 agrarian reform for many changes that
00:07:29 went against the church also the
00:07:32 stop to protect the church but
00:07:35 there were many people who did not
00:07:39 agree with these things in  then in
00:07:45 october 1934 the revolution took place the revolution
00:07:49 of october 1934 that began as the
00:07:55 worker revolution of asturias began in
00:07:59 asturias and in this revolution
00:08:03 the socialists had joined the general union
00:08:06 of workers
00:08:08 that was and is still a very
00:08:11 important union and the confederation  national
00:08:14 of workers and also the communists
00:08:19 the communist party
00:08:22 and many workers many workers in
00:08:26 asturias were miners and the miners
00:08:30 had weapons they had dynamite and they
00:08:34 used them to attack the civil
00:08:37 guard the civil guard is like a
00:08:40 spanish military police the civil guard and
00:08:44 the churches  they attacked them yes then the
00:08:48 government the government of spain to
00:08:51 defend itself sent the legion sent the
00:08:54 soldiers and sent the army that it had
00:08:57 in morocco that it had in north
00:09:00 africa I sent it to protect itself and the
00:09:04 army of morocco
00:09:07 was commanded by a general maybe
00:09:11 the general francisco franco sounds familiar to you
00:09:16 perhaps you may have heard it this
00:09:18 non-franco name would be  then the dictator of the
00:09:23 spanish dictatorship after the end of the
00:09:25 civil war then this revolution
00:09:29 ends with more than a thousand people dead and
00:09:34 several thousand people arrested
00:09:37 meanwhile catalonia takes the opportunity to
00:09:41 declare its independence to say
00:09:43 we are independent we are another
00:09:47 country but this only lasts a few
00:09:50 hours after a few hours the president of
00:09:53 catalonia is also arrested and vice versa
00:09:57 what they achieve is that their autonomy is suspended it
00:10:00 ceases to be an
00:10:03 autonomous community and the president of ruth
00:10:08 after all this well everyone
00:10:13 started not liking it anymore  to the mistake not so much the
00:10:17 right as the left so he
00:10:19 ended up resigning also le route
00:10:22 resigns and leaves and we already reached the last
00:10:27 stage the last part of the republic
00:10:30 the lefts form the popular front
00:10:35 they meet they unite in a single
00:10:38 political party in the front  popular and the
00:10:41 right also unite in a party
00:10:46 with bald sotelo bald sotelo at the
00:10:50 head of the party and bald s  What Othello was
00:10:54 saying is that he wanted the
00:10:58 republic to end and for the monarchy
00:11:01 to return to have a king again, but Seda was not
00:11:05 part of the group, he did not join
00:11:08 charges against Calvo. Sotelo Seda continued on his
00:11:11 side so in
00:11:15 1936 elections were held or  Maybe again
00:11:19 votes are held and the
00:11:23 popular front wins, the left wins, then
00:11:27 Manuel Azaña
00:11:30 Manuel Azaña once again becomes the
00:11:33 president of the government, although this time
00:11:36 the PSOE was not there, the PSOE was not
00:11:40 part of the government and once again Catalonia is given
00:11:44 autonomy  once again
00:11:49 the agrarian reform continues but
00:11:52 all of this still did not like the
00:11:56 most extremist sectors of both the
00:11:59 right and the parties to the
00:12:03 more left-wing parties and once
00:12:06 again there are revolts there are
00:12:09 protests again and there are also confrontations between Manuel
00:12:13 Azaña and  alcalá zamora one was the
00:12:16 president of the republic and the other the
00:12:19 president of the government as in some
00:12:22 countries where there is a prime minister and
00:12:25 president of the republic pu  it is in
00:12:27 spain it was it was the same
00:12:29 and there are also discrepancies they are not fully
00:12:33 understood then the president
00:12:36 alcalá zamora is dismissed what the
00:12:40 government did then manuel azaña
00:12:43 becomes president of the republic and
00:12:47 another president of the government and
00:12:50 several various military officers are appointed  members of the
00:12:53 army come together to carry out a
00:12:57 coup to change the government
00:13:00 but Manuel Azaña realizes he finds out
00:13:05 what is going to happen and prepares himself and
00:13:08 trusts General Mola
00:13:11 Azaña trusts General Mola
00:13:15 General Mola tells him  it helps to avoid the
00:13:18 coup no and general is cool they
00:13:21 helped him frankly and goded but the
00:13:25 situation was increasingly unstable
00:13:28 there were several murders
00:13:31 murders there were
00:13:34 demonstrations there were clashes and
00:13:37 some members of the civil guard of
00:13:41 this Spanish military style police who
00:13:46 were who were  In favor of the
00:13:49 socialists,
00:13:50 they arrested and assassinated Calvo
00:13:54 Sotelo, the leader of the right, and
00:13:58 this resulted in a revolt for  the whole
00:14:02 country and here the coup leaders
00:14:06 the military who wanted to carry out the coup
00:14:08 d'état took the opportunity to start their
00:14:12 coup d'état then this coup d'
00:14:15 état failed
00:14:17 they managed to change the government in a
00:14:21 single day but ended up in riots in
00:14:25 different parts of the country some
00:14:28 had  Others were not successful and Spain ended up being
00:14:32 divided into two zones: the
00:14:35 Republican zone and the zone of the
00:14:39 military insurgents, and thus in
00:14:42 1936 the Spanish Civil War began, which
00:14:46 would last three years, and we already told you about
00:14:50 this war in the video about the

211,"00:00:00 I already explained to you that Alfonso 13
00:00:04 became the King of Spain at a
00:00:07 time when the country was a bit
00:00:11 unstable, it was very unstable. We are going to see
00:00:14 if during his reign
00:00:19 the situation was stabilized more or not or, on
00:00:24 the contrary, it became  Worse, let's
00:00:28 see
00:00:31 [Music]
00:00:34 Hello, well, Alfonso 13 reigned between
00:00:39 1902 and
00:00:43 1931 and well, I already explained to you that
00:00:47 technically Alfonso 13 was the king
00:00:51 from the moment he was born,
00:00:53 but well, in 1902 he really began to
00:00:58 work like  king and we are going
00:01:02 to talk first about the first part
00:01:06 his reign of the first part in which
00:01:09 alfonso 13 was king and he had five
00:01:13 problems he had five problems in the
00:01:16 country at that time the first
00:01:19 problem is the problem of the government in
00:01:23 the government as  I already explained to you there were
00:01:26 two parties but the two leaders
00:01:29 died,
00:01:30 one was killed, the other died sick
00:01:34 and so the government really
00:01:40 wasn't very worn out and
00:01:43 people really didn't trust the government very much  erno
00:01:45 the second problem was the
00:01:49 labor movement there were more and more complaints
00:01:53 more and more protests from workers
00:01:56 from working class people the
00:01:59 third is that in recent years the
00:02:03 church had gained a lot of power the
00:02:06 power had increased the
00:02:09 influence that  had in the
00:02:12 and there were also many people who did
00:02:15 not like that room had problems
00:02:19 with the independence movement at that time
00:02:22 there were quite strong movements for
00:02:25 the independence of independence from
00:02:29 catalonia independence from galicia
00:02:31 independence from the basque country and at
00:02:35 that time well it was also  a
00:02:37 problem and the 5th the fifth were the
00:02:41 military the army we remember that
00:02:45 there was the disaster of 98 that
00:02:48 Cuba-Puerto Rico-Philippines was lost and then
00:02:52 many Spaniards realized that the
00:02:56 army was not very good and in truth in
00:02:59 the army there were many generals
00:03:02 commanders many high positions but
00:03:06 there were few soldiers who really
00:03:09 fought in then there was one more thing to
00:03:12 take into account in this period
00:03:15 morocco morocco which is down here
00:03:19 not under spain in africa at this
00:03:22 time the european countries had
00:03:26 just divided up the different regions of
00:03:29 africa and spain ended with the north of
00:03:33 morocco and france ended up with the
00:03:36 rest of the  country with the rest of morocco
00:03:39 then the turnismo system
00:03:43 continued for a few more years but in
00:03:47 1907 in 1907
00:03:51 antonio maura came to power antonio maura and antonio
00:03:55 maura what is happening in the
00:03:58 situation and think we have to make
00:04:02 changes we have to change things yes  We don't
00:04:05 change things, there is going to be a
00:04:08 revolution, the people are going to
00:04:10 revolutionize and then, although Antonio
00:04:13 Maura was a conservative, he decided to make what
00:04:16 he called a revolution from above, to
00:04:19 make changes so that it did not start to be
00:04:22 a real revolution, but during
00:04:25 that time there were problems in Morocco.
00:04:29 there began to be attacks against the
00:04:32 army in morocco began to see
00:04:36 a bit of a revolution and the
00:04:40 spanish army needed  more soldiers then
00:04:44 the government of spain' calls
00:04:47 citizens on reserve people who did not
00:04:51 work in the army but who
00:04:53 had worked before or who had been
00:04:56 trained and calls them to join this
00:05:00 in this fight in the north of morocco
00:05:03 well this caused many  problems many
00:05:07 people did not agree there began to
00:05:10 be protests there were strikes people
00:05:13 who refused to go to work to
00:05:16 protest this especially in
00:05:18 barcelona especially in the city of
00:05:21 barcelona and the problems were so
00:05:24 big that the government decided to declare a
00:05:28 state of war  it is good as a state
00:05:31 of emergency, not that it gives the government more
00:05:34 powers than usual so in
00:05:38 some Spanish cities there was
00:05:42 destruction there were people who broke
00:05:44 things in the streets there were many
00:05:47 arrests arrests of many people
00:05:50 especially anarchists people who
00:05:54 were against what  there was a
00:05:56 government and there were deaths people also
00:05:59 died because of this the
00:06:02 anarchists  from Spain they came to
00:06:05 coordinate they began to coordinate they
00:06:08 began to organize and at this
00:06:11 moment faith is created in this national commission
00:06:15 of workers is created at this
00:06:19 moment but now the cnt still exists right
00:06:23 now it is a union it is a
00:06:26 workers union so yes
00:06:29 there was  many problems especially in
00:06:32 barcelona and this is known as the
00:06:35 tragic week of barcelona after
00:06:38 this the king changed the president of the
00:06:42 government of spain the king
00:06:45 placed josé canalejas placed josé canalejas
00:06:49 who was a liberal and this was in
00:06:52 1910 then during  the time of josé
00:06:56 canalejas spain began to win
00:07:00 battles in morocco during this
00:07:03 time the mili was created the mili is the
00:07:07 military service that then existed until a
00:07:10 few years before it was my turn to
00:07:14 do it no and if the mili is a
00:07:18 mandatory service that the  Young Spaniards
00:07:21 were forced to go to the army for a few
00:07:24 months or a few years to learn to be
00:07:28 soldiers and it began to be done
00:07:31 during this period.  you time but then in me 912
00:07:35 an
00:07:36 anarchist killed him he murdered him just like they
00:07:40 had already murdered a president
00:07:43 before they
00:07:45 murdered josé canalejas and here
00:07:49 begins the second part the second
00:07:52 part the second phase of the reign of
00:07:56 alfonso 13 which is the
00:07:58 parliamentary crisis  the crisis of the parliament
00:08:01 of the government of spain in this period
00:08:04 the first world war began in the
00:08:07 first world war spain did not
00:08:10 participate it did not fight it was not part of the
00:08:13 first world war but
00:08:15 economically it went well for spain
00:08:18 because the countries of europe needed
00:08:23 many things they had  to buy things
00:08:26 for the war and spain began to earn a
00:08:29 lot of money
00:08:31 exporting things exporting products to
00:08:34 other european countries but this
00:08:38 also became a problem
00:08:41 for many products europe paid
00:08:45 more than the spanish could pay
00:08:48 many products were sold
00:08:51 abroad before  be sold in Spain
00:08:54 to the point that there began to be a lack of
00:08:57 products that were sold in  spain the
00:09:00 prices of things in spain began
00:09:04 to rise and then the labor movement
00:09:06 the workers the people who did not have
00:09:10 much money began to complain well
00:09:13 they began to complain
00:09:15 even more so in
00:09:19 1917 what we call the crisis of
00:09:24 1917 arrived so here  the military
00:09:28 were also complaining they were complaining
00:09:30 about the salary that the political opposition had
00:09:33 the other political party in the
00:09:36 government was also very critical of the
00:09:40 government and there were also many strikes
00:09:42 many people went on strike at that time and
00:09:46 they ended up with many good
00:09:49 things with very  and very bad 70 70 people
00:09:53 ended up dead in the hands of the army
00:09:56 the army killed 70 people the
00:10:00 following years because there were more and
00:10:02 more problems with the labor movement
00:10:05 then came the rif
00:10:09 war the rif war the rif tribes are
00:10:11 the berber tribes of  Morocco
00:10:15 then at this time
00:10:19 13,000 soldiers died 13,000 13,000 soldiers 13,000
00:10:24 Spanish soldiers  they died in the
00:10:28 conflict with the berber tribes then
00:10:30 with all this situation a
00:10:34 coup d'etat takes place again a
00:10:37 military general miguel miguel primo de rivera
00:10:40 many times we call him cousin of primo
00:10:43 de rivera and the dictatorship of
00:10:47 primo de rivera begins primo de rivera well  That
00:10:49 led to a coup and the king saw that
00:10:53 the other options weren't very
00:10:56 good either, so okay I let him carry out a
00:10:59 coup and that's how it was in
00:11:03 1923 and that's how the third part
00:11:08 of Alfonso's reign began 13 so this
00:11:12 dictatorship lasted seven  years and initially
00:11:16 the people, the people, were not very opposed even
00:11:20 though it was a dictatorship, they were
00:11:22 not very opposed because the system was no
00:11:25 longer working well and many people
00:11:27 thought that perhaps 'primo de rivera'
00:11:32 would dare to make the changes they were making
00:11:35 The changes that had to be made are missing,
00:11:37 but well, very soon it began to be
00:11:40 seen that it was not very good for
00:11:44 many people. Cousin de Rivera' Diesel
00:11:46 dissolved the government, undid the government,
00:11:49 no longer  there was an elected government he canceled the
00:11:53 constitution the constitution was no longer
00:11:56 valid
00:11:57 and in the positions of power in the
00:11:59 government primo de rivera' put the
00:12:03 people he wanted put his friends
00:12:06 the people who were going to do what he told them
00:12:08 primo de  Ribera took a
00:12:11 very hard position against the independence
00:12:14 movements against the independence movements
00:12:17 because he tried to fight hard against
00:12:21 them even so the situation was not
00:12:24 too unstable in
00:12:27 1925 in
00:12:30 1925 Spain won the war in the north
00:12:35 of Morocco and the economy of Spain was
00:12:39 good it was it was  quite well during this
00:12:42 period and then his dictatorship the
00:12:45 dictatorship of primo de rivera took the opportunity
00:12:48 to try to make itself try to legitimize
00:12:53 legitimize becoming more legitimate
00:12:56 converting from a military government to a
00:12:59 civilian government
00:13:01 the opposition against the dictatorship was
00:13:04 strong there were for example many
00:13:07 businessmen many people  also a rich
00:13:11 bourgeoisie who did not agree because
00:13:15 to begin with the government had
00:13:18 centralized  or a lot of control the
00:13:21 government had given many benefits to
00:13:24 its friends it had given benefits to
00:13:27 businessmen who were friends of cousin de
00:13:31 rivera or people who were in
00:13:34 important positions
00:13:35 then the opinion of the people
00:13:38 against the dictatorship began to grow and
00:13:42 reached  to a point that alfonso 13
00:13:46 asked cousin de rivera' who left he was
00:13:50 asked to resign to stop being a
00:13:52 dictator and to leave spain-
00:13:55 to leave the country because the king also
00:13:57 thought that if the people were against
00:14:01 of the dictatorship and he supported the
00:14:04 dictatorship that more and more people went
00:14:07 against him so the king hoped to
00:14:11 return to the previous situation he hoped
00:14:15 to return to the system of two parties that
00:14:18 would take turns but the situation in
00:14:21 Spain had changed a lot no longer  it was
00:14:24 the same at this time the
00:14:28 republicans meet the people who
00:14:31 thought well they didn't want to have a
00:14:35 king they didn't want to have a monarchy
00:14:37 they didn't want a republic then the
00:14:41 republics met  The blicanos wanted to ally themselves with
00:14:44 catalonia they wanted to ally themselves they wanted the
00:14:47 help of catalonia and they promise them that if
00:14:50 they get power in the country that
00:14:54 is bread that catalonia will have more autonomy it
00:14:57 will have the right to decide its own
00:15:02 laws and then the republicans
00:15:05 begin to plan a coup  state and
00:15:09 get rid of the king but they are discovered they are
00:15:12 discovered they
00:15:14 do not achieve their objective so at that
00:15:17 time the president was Juan Bautista
00:15:21 Aznar and Juan Bautista Aznar calls
00:15:25 municipal
00:15:28 elections calls elections calls for voting but in
00:15:31 the municipalities in the towns and cities
00:15:34 of Spain
00:15:35 this was already  In
00:15:37 1931, he called elections, he thought that if he
00:15:41 called elections, many people would vote for
00:15:44 his party and that he would be strengthened so
00:15:48 that more people would believe in him.
00:15:50 So, in fact, in the majority of
00:15:54 municipalities, in many municipalities in
00:15:56 Spain, the monarchists won,
00:16:00 the parties that  they were in favor of
00:16:03 having a monarchy, not what happens that the
00:16:06 republicans who were  An
00:16:09 against having a monarchy they won in the
00:16:12 big cities they won in the
00:16:14 important cities I don't know exactly
00:16:18 which ones they won but we assume that madrid
00:16:21 barceló sure in the biggest cities
00:16:24 so alfonso 13 seeing the
00:16:27 situation realizes that he can't continue
00:16:31 being king  and he leaves Spain he also
00:16:34 leaves and with this the second republic begins the second
00:16:37 Spanish republic
00:16:40 the second moment in which we did not have a
00:16:44 king or queen so this time this
00:16:48 republic how long do you think it lasted
00:16:51 how long it lasted write it in the
00:16:54 comments
00:16:55 in the next  In the video I will tell you about
00:16:57 how this republic was, if it was thanks to the fact
00:17:02 that there was no king, it became a
00:17:04 perfect country
00:17:06 and how the situation came to be that
00:17:11 a civil war began in Spain, okay

00:16:47 the proud atlantis sank
00:16:51 sank under the leaves

015,"00:00:00 In Mexico there are places that you may not
00:00:05 know but I'm sure you'll
00:00:09 love them
00:00:12 [Music]
00:00:15 Hi I'm Michelle I'm Mexican and I'm
00:00:21 very happy to be with you in a
00:00:25 new video today we're going to talk
00:00:28 about the 5 cities or states
00:00:32 not  so well known or not so visited in
00:00:37 mexico but i am sure you will
00:00:42 like them a lot
00:00:44 we start this list with number 1
00:00:48 oaxaca oaxaca is the best place to
00:00:54 learn about the traditions and customs of
00:00:59 mexico and you can do it through or with
00:01:03 its food its music  its dances and its
00:01:10 pieces
00:01:11 oaxaca is located in the south
00:01:16 of
00:01:17 mexico and if you take a flight from
00:01:21 mexico city
00:01:25 oaxaca you will arrive in one hour and
00:01:29 57 minutes
00:01:31 in oaxaca you will be able to enjoy
00:01:35 great parties my favorite is
00:01:40 guelaguetza
00:01:41 what guelaguetza means  In Spanish
00:01:45 it means to offer, that
00:01:48 is to say, the party to offer and it is done
00:01:54 in honor or to celebrate the Virgen del
00:01:59 Carmen as she is celebrated with music, dance,
00:02:06 dancing, singing
00:02:09 and with lots of food from the  What you can
00:02:14 try is the tamales,
00:02:19 the tasajo, which is a meat from this area,
00:02:24 and also the mold with grasshoppers. If
00:02:32 we eat grasshoppers in Mexico, I have never
00:02:37 tried them, but maybe one day I will do it in
00:02:42 Oaxaca or with you,
00:02:46 something else that you can also do in
00:02:50 Oaxaca is to know archaeological zones or places,
00:02:55 that is, places where there are remains of
00:03:01 ancient peoples or
00:03:04 civilizations, and that were left
00:03:08 there in perfect condition. It looks very good,
00:03:14 such as the Monte Alban area, for example, it
00:03:18 is very
00:03:22 surprising.
00:03:25 area of ​​the
00:03:32 petrified waterfalls of jermaine el agua the
00:03:36 frozen waterfalls
00:03:38 of guilherme el agua
00:03:42 this place can offer you
00:03:45 many ecotourism activities
00:03:50 but if you prefer the heat the beaches I
00:03:55 recommend you visit the famous virgin beaches in oaxaca
00:04:02 these are called like that because they have very
00:04:07 few or none  of constructions of
00:04:11 hotels or buildings and also here you can
00:04:17 practice being I recommend
00:04:20 these beaches that  you know the one of mazunte
00:04:25 and zipolite two very beautiful magical places
00:04:33 I am sure you will like them in
00:04:36 number 2
00:04:39 we have chiapas chiapas is known
00:04:44 as the treasure of mexico for its
00:04:49 natural beauties such as jungles
00:04:53 waterfalls
00:04:54 really beautiful canyons chiapas
00:05:00 is also south of  mexico if you
00:05:05 take a flight from mexico city
00:05:10 to chiapas you will arrive in one hour and
00:05:15 43 minutes chiapas is also known
00:05:20 for being
00:05:21 magical and it is because here there are four
00:05:26 magical towns that are palenque comitán de
00:05:32 domínguez san cristóbal de las casas
00:05:35 chiapas de corzo
00:05:37 these places  They are called or named
00:05:42 as magical towns because they have
00:05:46 attributes and qualities of legends or
00:05:52 important stories
00:05:55 for the state of Chiapas
00:05:59 but also for tourists who
00:06:02 visit it at number 3 we have San
00:06:08 Luis Potosí San Luis Potosí is one of
00:06:12 my favorite places
00:06:14 in all  Mexico and the world
00:06:19 San Luis Potosí is very close
00:06:22 to Mexico City and is in the
00:06:26 center of the country if you take  a flight
00:06:31 from mexico city
00:06:33 to san luís potosí
00:06:36 you will arrive in one hour and 10 minutes
00:06:41 and here what i recommend you to know is
00:06:46 the huasteca potosina
00:06:50 this is a place to do and to know the
00:06:56 nature of being here i
00:07:01 recommend you visit the basement of the
00:07:04 swallows
00:07:05 the tamul waterfall and also the garden
00:07:11 of edward james this is a very
00:07:17 impressive garden that you will not find
00:07:21 anywhere else because it is a garden or
00:07:26 castle in the middle of the jungle so it is
00:07:32 a true work of art I had the
00:07:37 opportunity to travel to this part of
00:07:41 Mexico to the Huasteca Potosina with my
00:07:45 dad and my sister and we spent a
00:07:49 whole week there
00:07:52 visiting
00:07:54 all the Huasteca Potosina. It is
00:07:59 one of the most beautiful experiences I
00:08:04 have had
00:08:06 and by the way if you go to this place you will
00:08:10 In this area I recommend that you try the
00:08:15 famous
00:08:17 enchiladas potosinas, they are
00:08:22 delicious, they are good, they are tortillas
00:08:26 with chicken,
00:08:29 folded on top, they put a
00:08:34 special sauce that they only make in e  This place and
00:08:39 much much that is
00:08:43 later they melt it and enjoy it
00:08:48 very well at number 4 we have one to
00:08:54 4
00:08:55 this place is one of the most colorful
00:08:59 in all of Mexico and where you will also be
00:09:04 able to experience a bit of a party, a bit
00:09:08 of terror and a  little love
00:09:12 guanajuato is in the center of mexico and
00:09:17 is an hour by plane from
00:09:22 mexico city one thing that i recommend you to do
00:09:25 in guanajuato is to go
00:09:30 to an alleyway here people can be
00:09:35 seen gather
00:09:37 outside the famous juares theater for
00:09:42 later
00:09:45 walking through the alleys of oaxaca with
00:09:51 music while
00:09:54 they are dancing singing
00:09:56 and it
00:10:00 is a great experience in guanajuato
00:10:04 there is a museum to see the mummies that
00:10:10 are the mummies well they are bodies that are
00:10:15 kept in perfect condition they look very
00:10:20 good despite the fact that these people
00:10:24 They died a long time ago and they
00:10:29 are dedicated to them. This museum is made so
00:10:33 that people can get to know them. It is something very
00:10:39 similar to what was done in ancient
00:10:42 Egypt, but not everything is a party, not everything.  do is
00:10:48 terror in guanajuato there is also a lot of
00:10:53 love
00:10:54 and this one thing that everyone who goes
00:10:58 as a couple has to know is the
00:11:03 famous alley
00:11:05 of the kiss. It
00:11:07 is said that if you and your partner visit
00:11:12 this alley and kiss on the
00:11:18 third step you will have  seven years of
00:11:24 good luck
00:11:25 but
00:11:27 if they do
00:11:29 n't kiss each other badly they
00:11:31 will have seven years of bad luck at
00:11:37 number five last but not least
00:11:43 we have hidalgo and valgo it is
00:11:48 right next to
00:11:53 mexico city and this place was a very
00:11:58 Important for the history of Mexico,
00:12:02 here you will be able to see the first
00:12:06 magical town
00:12:08 named after that in 2001 and it is
00:12:14 funny, another place that you have to visit
00:12:18 is Tula Hidalgo,
00:12:22 this place is
00:12:25 amazing, here you will be able to meet
00:12:30 the famous
00:12:31 Atlanteans that are  statues made of
00:12:36 stone and carved by hand these
00:12:42 statues
00:12:44 represent the Toltec warriors who
00:12:49 are
00:12:50 the Toltecs. They were an ancient
00:12:54 civilization in this place in this area
00:12:59 and they decided to  Ron have
00:13:04 his warriors represented in stone,
00:13:09 these statues are almost 5 meters
00:13:15 high
00:13:18 and are on top of the pyramid
00:13:23 or temple and the legend says that they were
00:13:27 made to protect this site, this
00:13:33 sacred place.
00:13:35 Another thing that I think is very important to
00:13:39 mention is that these warriors are
00:13:44 statues were made between 800 and
00:13:52 1200 after Christ
00:13:56 imagine how many years they have been there and you can
00:14:01 see them they are still
00:14:06 as we could see Mexico is an
00:14:10 incredible place and full of places with
00:14:14 history and fun so tell me now
00:14:18 if you could visit any of these 5
00:14:23 places that I told you

218,"00:00:00 In this video I am going to talk to you about one of
00:00:04 the biggest ecological disasters
00:00:07 in the history of Spain' I am going to talk to you about
00:00:11 the disaster of the Prestige
00:00:16 [Music]
00:00:19 The Prestige was a single-hull oil tanker
00:00:24 that sailed near the
00:00:28 Galician coast of the northwest coast of
00:00:33 Spain in  november 2002 a
00:00:38 monohull tanker is an oil tanker that
00:00:43 only has a barrier
00:00:46 between the contents between the cargo of the
00:00:49 ship and the outside there are other ships that
00:00:54 have
00:00:55 a double barrier a double hull but
00:00:59 this ship the prestige was
00:01:04 a single barrier monohull tanker  between the
00:01:08 cargo and the outside
00:01:10 well this ship was sailing near the
00:01:13 coast of Galicia in 2002 when it
00:01:18 suffered a breakdown in the engine room
00:01:24 and the ship drifted aimlessly
00:01:27 in a storm and with the storm the
00:01:34 ship suffered an accident
00:01:36 It is not very clear what happened, maybe an
00:01:42 external object floating in the sea
00:01:45 hit the ship or maybe something that was
00:01:50 inside the ship hit the hull
00:01:55 but in the end the  The result was that the
00:01:59 ship had a fissure in the hull, a
00:02:02 small fissure that grew
00:02:06 until it reached 35 meters and through this
00:02:11 fissure
00:02:13 all the oil that
00:02:16 was inside the ship was coming out. The oil that
00:02:20 the ship had inside was
00:02:23 spilling into  the sea when this
00:02:27 begins to happen the
00:02:30 Spanish authorities and the captain of the ship
00:02:34 begin to discuss what is the
00:02:37 best way to proceed to
00:02:42 avoid a major disaster because they knew
00:02:47 that the oil was spilling
00:02:51 in large quantities into the sea they thought
00:02:55 of  the possibility of taking the ship to
00:02:59 a port of refuge to try to contain
00:03:03 the spill, but in the end they decided that
00:03:08 the best option was to take the ship
00:03:12 away from the Spanish coasts,
00:03:16 tow it, pull the ship and take it
00:03:20 far away from the coasts, and that they
00:03:23 did, they towed the prestige for
00:03:27 days they pulled the ship until it was as far
00:03:31 as possible from the Spanish coast but
00:03:36 after a few days
00:03:38 towing the prest  ige the ship breaks
00:03:42 in two
00:03:44 obviously the ship still contained
00:03:47 oil and that oil was coming out and
00:03:51 is coming out of the ship spilling into the
00:03:55 sea but at this time spanish politicians
00:03:59 deny the possibility of an oil slick
00:04:05 an oil slick is when a large mass
00:04:09 of  Oil is spilled into the sea and
00:04:13 destroys the marine ecosystem
00:04:16 Spanish politicians said no it will not
00:04:20 happen no there will not be an oil
00:04:24 slick they denied it at that time
00:04:27 but the oil was already beginning to reach
00:04:31 the
00:04:33 Spanish coasts all along the coast  From the north of
00:04:37 Spain to Galicia, Asturias,
00:04:41 Cantabria, the Basque Country, even as far as
00:04:46 France, this oil spill came and
00:04:49 the Galician fishermen
00:04:53 tried to contain this spill by going out
00:04:58 to sea with their little boats and trying to
00:05:01 collect the oil, but to no avail
00:05:05 because the oil continued to arrive
00:05:09 thousands of tons.  oil
00:05:12 continued to reach the coast so
00:05:16 volunteers from all over Spain are asked
00:05:20 to help clean up the vert  gone and
00:05:25 many volunteers thousands of volunteers
00:05:28 from all over Spain are going to Galicia
00:05:32 to help clean up this spill
00:05:36 that was not only killing the
00:05:40 marine ecosystem but also
00:05:45 affecting a very important sector, a very important industry
00:05:49 in northern Spain, which
00:05:52 is  the fishing industry there are
00:05:55 many people who live from
00:05:58 fishing and during this time it was
00:06:01 impossible for fishermen to go
00:06:04 fishing so this greatly affected the
00:06:09 economy in galicia and northern
00:06:13 spain to claim
00:06:16 political and
00:06:19 environmental responsibilities galician citizens
00:06:23 create the  platform never again and
00:06:27 they, well, they call demonstrations
00:06:32 in Galicia and in other parts of Spain, well,
00:06:35 to demonstrate to protest
00:06:39 the management that the government is doing
00:06:44 of it since the accident, there is great
00:06:49 popular discontent, the people are not at
00:06:52 all happy with the government's management
00:06:57 to  demand that
00:06:59 an accident such as a protest never happen again
00:07:02 Massive action called
00:07:04 with the platform Nunca Máis since
00:07:07 political parties unions joined since
00:07:09 thousands of citizens attended,
00:07:11 especially sailors fishermen shipowners.
00:07:24 million euros and the
00:07:29 trial for the prestige does not
00:07:34 begin until nine years after the
00:07:38 accident for nine years there is a
00:07:41 judicial investigation and then
00:07:44 the trial begins and the only one convicted
00:07:50 in this trial was the captain of the ship
00:07:55 for disobedience to the
00:08:00 Spanish authorities  the captain of the ship
00:08:03 and it took a few hours to comply with the
00:08:08 orders of the Spanish authorities to
00:08:12 move the ship away from the Spanish coasts
00:08:16 and finally the platform never again
00:08:21 succeeds in getting the government to prohibit the
00:08:25 navigation of this type of
00:08:30 tankers of monohull oil tankers near the
00:08:34 coasts  near the coast and that

00:00:40 to see how well if you're a good
00:00:43 driver or not I would say yes
00:00:47 maybe a little fittipaldi but yes well
00:00:51 let's see let's see come on let's start
00:00:54 hello, good morning, are you going to come in,
00:01:00 good morning, like we have
00:01:03 and laura, laura, okay, today I think it's your
00:01:08 first class, really, yes,
00:01:10 I'm a little nervous, okay,
00:01:13 calm down, nothing happens today, we're going to go
00:01:17 through streets with very few cars,
00:01:20 if you  You just have to be careful to
00:01:24 go straight move to the left to
00:01:27 the right okay okay do you have some
00:01:31 previous experience driving to see
00:01:36 experience and experience let's say I
00:01:39 went to a parking lot at a flea market with my
00:01:43 father and we were  We are with the car in
00:01:47 first gear and second gear but that
00:01:50 's all it goes first and second then
00:01:53 you have already used the clutch to put the
00:01:56 gear you have used the gear change
00:02:00 well you already have a little bit of
00:02:02 experience
00:02:04 but I don't know if in this car  maybe it
00:02:07 's different then
00:02:10 in the dry if all cars well you have
00:02:13 to find the point because it's a
00:02:17 little different how the
00:02:18 gear change works the sensitivity of
00:02:21 the brake clutch and everything no
00:02:25 so come on let's start close
00:02:28 close the door
00:02:31 ok then which ones  They are the steps to
00:02:35 start driving that you have to do
00:02:38 to see in the driving school they told me how
00:02:43 good the seatbelt is in the center very good very
00:02:46 good good good first step I also
00:02:51 safety first of all and what more in the
00:02:55 mirrors
00:02:57 if you like the mirrors the middle
00:03:00 also
00:03:02 in the middle
00:03:04 also the steering wheel is not very far
00:03:07 or very close to you it is not a good
00:03:11 distance if you do not have to adjust the
00:03:13 seat to good the seat is like that  I'm going to
00:03:17 go up a bit
00:03:19 is that now it's a bit a bit short
00:03:26 andthe
00:03:27 handbrake is on
00:03:34 I don't know if this car to start it
00:03:36 I have to clutch yes yes you have to
00:03:40 swallow and of course or brake okay okay
00:03:44 to turn it on you have to deliver
00:03:47 and for  I remember it because I'm a
00:03:51 little confused a little nervous the one on
00:03:54 the left completely the pedal on the
00:03:56 left completely is the clutch the one in the
00:04:00 middle is the brake and the right is the
00:04:04 accelerator right exactly very well very
00:04:06 well it's yours you already tried  the
00:04:10 written exam true yes very well very well it
00:04:14 shows it shows
00:04:15 thanks you take advantage of it the first time yes the
00:04:19 first time and very well congratulations then
00:04:22 you already have the key in if
00:04:27 you start the car well you
00:04:30 pressed the clutch
00:04:33 and turned the key and stepped on the  brake just in
00:04:38 case you step on the brake you also get an
00:04:41 idea getting used to always also
00:04:43 stepping on the brake okay well
00:04:45 I understand now in the key that
00:04:53 's it okay then here we are
00:04:58 standing on a street that there are no cars
00:05:00 you can  start moving forward okay as
00:05:02 we start moving well let's see I remove the
00:05:06 handbrake it
00:05:08 's very good that you remembered I
00:05:11 was already waiting for you to start
00:05:14 moving the car with the handbrake
00:05:15 it has still put on
00:05:20 very well and what else
00:05:24 do I put in first very well  You have to
00:05:28 put first gear
00:05:29 in this car, which is well,
00:05:32 as I think, it is always to the
00:05:35 left and up
00:05:39 and now I have to take my foot off the
00:05:43 clutch little by little, this is the most
00:05:45 difficult thing to see how to start
00:05:49 without stalling  the car without stopping the
00:05:51 engine of the car I think that it is going to
00:05:54 stall me, yes, let's
00:05:57 see, that's it, it has stalled,
00:05:59 well, he presses the clutch and
00:06:02 brake again and turns the world on again,
00:06:05 I'm going to pay him and he will  I
00:06:10 turn on ok tried it again
00:06:13 ok to get
00:06:16 very well we are already here
00:06:22 so keep careful careful
00:06:24 careful with the steering wheel don't keep it
00:06:26 straight the steering wheel is very sensitive and
00:06:31 especially the brake is very sensitive it is very
00:06:34 easy to brake and not miss a
00:06:37 blow  no
00:06:39 ok ok very well then let's
00:06:44 try shifting to second gear ok ok
00:06:49 well this is a little easier than
00:06:51 starting the car we are doing what do you
00:06:54 do to put second gear in the
00:06:57 clutch again come on and down
00:07:01 careful careful you have to  release the
00:07:03 accelerator when you learn the clutch
00:07:05 if not the engine
00:07:08 is
00:07:12 revving ok ok ok ok ok but let it go ok ok be
00:07:15 careful one piece of information a cat a cat
00:07:20 sorry
00:07:22 ok no no no good it's not your fault
00:07:24 past the cat you have to react
00:07:27 No, you haven't seen the cat, well, I
00:07:31 've seen it leaving, I think you
00:07:33 haven't killed it, you haven't run over it
00:07:38 anymore, at the beginning, you can be very,
00:07:41 very concentrated on the job of
00:07:44 driving, on everything you have to do
00:07:46 and you're not  looking over time,
00:07:50 everything will come out naturally in a
00:07:52 mechanical way and you will be able to concentrate looking at what
00:07:55 is happening in the street, which is the most
00:07:57 important thing,
00:08:01 come again if I know that this first time yes,
00:08:09 ok, it has not been very well understood or not.
00:08:12 you're improving, change second okay
00:08:16 then we're going to get to the
00:08:19 traffic light okay okay
00:08:22 you see that the traffic light is now amber
00:08:24 it's amber it's going to turn red
00:08:27 so you can go
00:08:29 downhill and reduce speed
00:08:33 okay come on but I think it's braking
00:08:37 too hard  I know if you have braked and it has
00:08:41 braked without depressing the clutch too,
00:08:43 then you have stalled again
00:08:46 the engine has turned off
00:08:48 okay
00:08:53 okay that's
00:08:55 good I think that for a first class
00:08:58 it's okay they
00:09:02 are the steps we all have
00:09:05 to go through no  It happens to all of us that
00:09:08 we have to get used to
00:09:10 how the car engine works and such and we
00:09:14 can see each other in the next class for
00:09:17 good so you can keep practicing and well
00:09:21 there are still many things we have to
00:09:23 practice the stops we have to
00:09:26 practice the roundabouts
00:09:27 you have a lot a lot  What to learn if
00:09:31 the class has been very short and if that is
00:09:34 a bit short but good is that
00:09:37 this is how we maintain interest so we do not get
00:09:40 bored
00:09:42 and how many classes  aces do you think I'm going to
00:09:44 need it before I can take the exam,
00:09:48 seeing how you're doing I think
00:09:50 about
00:09:51 two
00:09:53 hundred Zetas will
00:09:57 understand where I get that money,
00:10:01 that's good, you'll have to find a
00:10:03 way.

00:00:10 a recent news hello hello well yes
00:00:21 recently I don't know if you have seen it
00:00:24 but it has appeared in the newspapers in the
00:00:27 news that the president of mexico no
00:00:31 what is his name  President Andrés
00:00:33 Manuel López Obrador and they call him time
00:00:35 love and blog Balearic Islands because it is very
00:00:38 long It is a very long name and the
00:00:40 President of Mexico has asked the King of
00:00:44 Spain to apologize
00:00:46 to him to apologize for the colonization of
00:00:50 Mexico for the colonization  from mexico through
00:00:54 spain 500 years ago
00:00:58 santi you were surprised i was surprised
00:01:01 because i said well
00:01:04 it seemed strange to me because i think it is
00:01:07 something that people in the government
00:01:09 talk about for example there are many colonies in
00:01:12 the world if india was a colony of the
00:01:15 usa  a colony of the Philippines a colony
00:01:19 and even cuba many countries and I think I do
00:01:23 n't remember this kind of apology and it
00:01:27 seemed strange to me that the
00:01:29 president of Mexico took them out
00:01:31 if it was something that told me  om surprise
00:01:34 you think it's something that's important to
00:01:37 mexico
00:01:40 on the one hand i think it could be
00:01:45 like when you're not maybe he's crazy
00:01:48 but like when you break up with his anal ex-girlfriend
00:01:50 or there were some things and in the end he
00:01:54 says you know  that we end for peace
00:01:57 I apologize for what you did
00:02:00 and apologize for what you did and
00:02:02 we are at peace on the one hand it could be
00:02:04 like that but on the other hand being honest
00:02:08 is that mexico would not be what it is right now
00:02:11 what it is now  not for him, for the
00:02:15 Spanish empire, yes, the river
00:02:18 would not exist to the same culture and perhaps the
00:02:21 borders and the language would all
00:02:23 be completely different.
00:02:28 like a
00:02:32 mold that wanted mexico and many
00:02:37 people who now live in mexico are
00:02:40 descendants of spanish yes yes
00:02:42 quite a few mexicans are mixed or
00:02:45 spanish is with this french the
00:02:50 spanish who see themselves as spanish
00:02:54 then most of  The people,
00:02:56 most Mexicans believe, is that they
00:02:58 consider that this is something important
00:03:00 that Spain apologizes. Do you think it is something
00:03:03 more from the indigenous communities that
00:03:07 perhaps they perceive, there is still some feeling left,
00:03:09 so you think
00:03:12 I have not spoken with people from
00:03:14 indigenous communities, but I believe  What
00:03:17 are the indigenous people in Mexico? They are the
00:03:21 people who are there the least. I
00:03:23 think that what the indigenous people
00:03:25 care about is that the government helps them
00:03:28 create infrastructure. The Mexican government,
00:03:29 not the Spanish government,
00:03:32 helps them create infrastructure in Mexico
00:03:33 so they can get out.  go ahead and have a better
00:03:36 chance of finding a job if I
00:03:39 don't think they thought or the
00:03:40 Spanish empire years ago I don't think they even
00:03:42 have time to think about that I think
00:03:45 that the people who would think that would
00:03:49 perhaps be historians
00:03:55 slightly
00:03:59 as they say it contains is an idea
00:04:01 quite deep-rooted quite
00:04:05 radical or even on the one hand that have
00:04:08 a concrete ideology or not
00:04:11 yes
00:04:14 At least in my generation, I
00:04:16 don't remember that there was resentment towards
00:04:18 Spain because of this.
00:04:21 In general, Spain is badly listed in
00:04:23 Mexico.
00:04:38 there has been a response from the
00:04:41 moncloa the moncloa is the government of
00:04:44 spain it is the house where the
00:04:47 president of spain lives and well and from the
00:04:50 government of spain they have said no
00:04:52 no they are not going to apologize that it does not make
00:04:54 sense what a good thing they have said  It doesn't make
00:04:58 sense to judge what happened 500 years
00:05:01 ago from the current point of
00:05:04 view, no,
00:05:06 but for example, Spain already apologized
00:05:10 for something else that happened 500 years
00:05:15 ago.  now
00:05:18 something more than 500 years ago the Jews were thrown out
00:05:21 and a few years ago only a
00:05:24 few years ago the
00:05:27 government made a law that officially apologized
00:05:30 and that the descendants the
00:05:33 grandchildren of the grandchildren of the  The grandchildren of
00:05:35 those Jews can now return to
00:05:37 Spain and they are given Spanish nationality.
00:05:40 No, then it is something that is
00:05:43 good to do for the same amount of time
00:05:46 and that is why it is also something that they say,
00:05:49 well, yes, they have apologized for that,
00:05:51 too, something like that  Because of the
00:05:54 colonization of the Americas,
00:05:57 well, it wouldn't be bad either. I
00:06:00 don't really know if it would help if there are many
00:06:02 people who care today or not,
00:06:05 because of course that happened a long time ago,
00:06:09 I don't think it would help, but it would be very
00:06:11 interesting to see what it
00:06:14 is.  to see them apologize would be in
00:06:17 my opinion to see a transition of
00:06:19 ideology by this new age
00:06:21 as an age in which
00:06:25 people accept that colonization
00:06:29 and that whole age of exploration of the
00:06:32 new world was something that was done  in an
00:06:33 erroneous way and I feel that on the one
00:06:36 hand the right-
00:06:39 wing conservative would say no, no, these actions
00:06:42 cannot be judged, they are actions that happened and
00:06:44 shaped us, but on the part of the
00:06:46 left maybe if it is something they accept
00:06:49 or not they are
00:06:53 not there I don't think it helps but
00:06:55 [Music]
00:06:56 some protocol could be interesting
00:06:59 what would happen with that it's a bit of a
00:07:01 symbolic gesture no because since then a
00:07:04 lot of time has passed and there were also
00:07:06 wars between  Spain and Mexico, then the
00:07:09 independence of Mexico, but
00:07:11 it has never really been admitted that it was, that is,
00:07:15 what was done was wrong, they did not take
00:07:17 land, because from other civilizations, from
00:07:20 other tribes, from other people,
00:07:23 and many died, many people died, there are
00:07:26 different estimates, but
00:07:30 Most estimates believe that a thousand died and
00:07:33 surely more than half
00:07:35 of the people who lived there in Mexico
00:07:37 died and some estimates died 90% are
00:07:40 the people of 2 the epidemic is what I
00:07:43 read in history class
00:07:45 but I also  You told me why
00:07:48 we were talking about this the other day.
00:07:49 You told me the reactions of your Mexican friends, well,
00:07:52 on Facebook or on
00:07:54 social networks, and what does the g think?  Being
00:07:58 a very interesting friend commented
00:08:01 that
00:08:02 he said that the Mexicans on the one hand
00:08:07 identify us with the indigenous but
00:08:11 they have not started to think that
00:08:13 scientific in the Spanish but they feel
00:08:16 that their lives are more similar to those of
00:08:20 the Spaniards than to those of  the indigenous
00:08:25 and above all perhaps also aspire to
00:08:27 be a society like that more similar to the
00:08:31 western one alicia gives yes
00:08:34 many people many people who do
00:08:37 want to be ox more oxygen
00:08:41 a more westernized culture and
00:08:43 people who seek not to be so
00:08:47 westernized but I believe  that perhaps the
00:08:48 majority prefer to be more
00:08:51 westernized
00:08:54 and you were arrested it was your friends who were
00:08:56 saying or what a shame that the president
00:08:58 of mexico says this you didn't think they
00:09:03 made memes on the internet yes I
00:09:07 don't know
00:09:08 as the president I demand that you
00:09:11 apologize to me  things and you see me on the
00:09:13 internet I
00:09:14 rarely share that on social networks
00:09:18 but on the one hand I did feel
00:09:24 a little embarrassed but
00:09:30 I don't know that we are seen as people
00:09:33 who are resentful and I really don't
00:09:36 feel that way I didn't convert anything
00:09:39 but my friends and they shared jokes
00:09:41 jokes mockery
00:09:44 because of course now in Spain the
00:09:47 president the president the king because
00:09:50 they ask him to apologize to the kingdom  and
00:09:53 the king from the royal house has
00:09:56 not said anything to me, but of course the king that
00:09:59 exists now has nothing to do with
00:10:01 the kings that existed at that time that
00:10:03 existed 500 years ago I think that
00:10:06 apologizing is also something that is not  It is not
00:10:08 difficult, it is something that is quite easy
00:10:12 and perhaps so you can set a bit
00:10:15 of a precedent to say that these types
00:10:17 of actions are okay, because today
00:10:19 we do not accept them,
00:10:24 but of course,
00:10:26 how far do we have to go
00:10:29 apologizing for something that  it
00:10:32 happened 500 years ago but there is something that happened
00:10:34 a thousand years ago we also have to
00:10:36 apologize or the romans don't have to
00:10:39 apologize for the countries
00:10:42 they invaded it's not a bit arbitrary
00:10:46 the things that  they have passed and many
00:10:49 people don't really feel them anymore and they don't and they
00:10:53 don't remember to what extent, well, we
00:10:56 have to go back in history and
00:10:58 apologize and dad because if I
00:11:01 remember correctly the Spanish arrived and at
00:11:03 that time they said these lands are
00:11:05 claimed in the name of god in the
00:11:07 name of the father if I remember well
00:11:09 then it was the father he also got
00:11:13 involved in that then it would also be
00:11:16 but
00:11:19 I don't know many Mexicans say that the
00:11:21 Spaniards who have recent Mexicans
00:11:24 did not resent in the past it
00:11:26 was the Spaniards  who stayed to
00:11:29 live in mexico so why are they the ones
00:11:31 who arrived and stayed there
00:11:35 so I don't know it's complicated later
00:11:38 I've also read opinions that there are people in
00:11:41 mexico who say that the president
00:11:44 has been around for half a year I think since
00:11:46 he was elected  since he began to
00:11:48 govern in December and he has read
00:11:50 opinions that say that the president
00:11:52 is trying not to make people notice so much
00:11:56 that his government is not
00:11:59 working as well as expected and
00:12:01 trying to distract us by looking for
00:12:03 other things not others looking for
00:12:05 distractions
00:12:06 you know the state of politics in
00:12:09 Mexico and what the president has done
00:12:11 so no I really did not stay with the
00:12:13 previous one but since I've been here  in
00:12:16 thailand
00:12:18 no no i don't follow the news there are times when i
00:12:20 see a news story and i say how amazing
00:12:23 this happened i saw a
00:12:26 fuel explosion and but i saw it that there was a
00:12:29 previous story but i really don't follow
00:12:31 the national mexico news stay tuned
00:12:33 well well i think  We
00:12:35 can leave it here now, we have explained a
00:12:37 bit about the situation and our opinion,
00:12:41 and let's see if we can make more
00:12:42 videos like this about
00:12:45 important news about society that has been
00:12:47 happening lately, and thank you, yes, thank you for

",3
048,"00:00:00 Today I'm going to talk about why I don't
00:00:04 like to correct because I don't like to
00:00:07 correct errors
00:00:10 when someone writing or speaking
00:00:13 Spanish makes a mistake they say they
00:00:18 say something wrong because I don't like to
00:00:22 correct it
00:00:24 [Music]
00:00:29 hello good ones I know many of
00:00:33 you  Many of you write in the
00:00:37 comments you
00:00:38 write messages in Spanish you
00:00:43 leave a message in Spanish and you ask me you ask
00:00:47 me to correct you tell me Pablo
00:00:51 if I'm wrong correct me please
00:00:55 but I never do it I never
00:00:59 correct people and today I'm going to explain
00:01:04 why  I'm going to explain why I never
00:01:08 correct errors
00:01:11 and the first reason
00:01:17 why I don't correct is that it doesn't seem to
00:01:21 help, it's not good, there is research,
00:01:26 there are papers, no, I like to read
00:01:30 research on languages, and
00:01:34 research isn't there.  Of course, correcting
00:01:38 mistakes helps telling
00:01:42 someone and that's not right. It's not clear
00:01:46 that for languages ​​to learn languages
00:01:49 it helps to improve,
00:01:52 but it does seem  It may be that there are several
00:01:55 bad things, several things about correcting,
00:01:59 about saying that something is wrong, it seems that it
00:02:03 has negative things, but why,
00:02:06 because it doesn't help, I think, I think that the reason
00:02:11 why it doesn't help is to tell someone
00:02:14 that they have made a mistake or that it is wrong to
00:02:16 correct  correcting mistakes is because
00:02:20 when we speak when we write but
00:02:23 above all above all when we speak
00:02:26 knowing that something is right or wrong
00:02:31 is not the same as feeling it knowing the
00:02:34 rule is not the same as feeling this
00:02:39 sounds good or not no this does not sound  it sounds
00:02:43 bad so if I correct you, you'll
00:02:48 know it was wrong, but you
00:02:52 won't feel when something sounds good or
00:02:57 when something sounds bad,
00:02:59 it's not the same, that's why I think that correcting
00:03:03 saying that is not right like that is fine
00:03:07 no it doesn't help it's not good
00:03:12 and  the reason why it is something bad is
00:03:16 something that has bad things is that
00:03:20 when we are corrected when we are told that
00:03:24 this is wrong we have less self-
00:03:27 confidence we doubt we doubt more when
00:03:32 speaking we doubt d  Yes, what we say is
00:03:36 right or wrong and it also
00:03:40 affects fluency, we do not speak so
00:03:44 fluently,
00:03:45 making mistakes, making mistakes
00:03:49 is something natural, it is normal if you
00:03:52 are speaking or writing
00:03:55 above your level and the best
00:04:00 way is  The best way not to make
00:04:03 mistakes, not to be wrong, is to keep
00:04:07 listening, keep receiving input, not
00:04:11 listening, reading, and this is how to improve,
00:04:16 is to improve your level, and it
00:04:19 won't be necessary, you won't have to speak or
00:04:22 write above
00:04:25 your level,
00:04:27 so  if you write a
00:04:30 comment below write yourself a message and
00:04:34 ask me ask me pablo pablo correct

077,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about a subject that leads
00:00:05 to a lot of controversy there is a lot of debate I
00:00:10 do not want you to give me your opinion I
00:00:14 am going to tell you what I think what I think
00:00:17 are the good things and the bad things and
00:00:21 give you my opinion and I want you to
00:00:23 answer me  tell me your opinion
00:00:26 in the comments below,
00:00:28 okay
00:00:31 [Music]
00:00:35 hello, well, yes, as you have seen in the
00:00:39 title, I am going to talk about the death
00:00:42 penalty the death penalty
00:00:46 is when a person
00:00:49 is sentenced to kill him
00:00:52 when someone is a judge  or a jury
00:00:56 decides that this person has done something
00:00:59 very bad he is a murderer or he has done something
00:01:03 very very bad and he has to die and in the
00:01:06 end they kill him they kill him or with
00:01:09 an injection or with an electric chair or by
00:01:15 shooting him there are many ways for him
00:01:19 world of executing executing
00:01:22 people applying the death penalty
00:01:27 and the death penalty in spain has not existed
00:01:31 for many years since I don't know
00:01:34 when it was last applied
00:01:36 but surely since the 70s it no longer
00:01:41 exists in  it is  but there are countries where
00:01:44 there are still many countries where
00:01:47 the death penalty exists,
00:01:50 so
00:01:52 we must have the death penalty, is it
00:01:55 a good thing for us, is it a good thing
00:01:59 for society or not,
00:02:02 and one of the main reasons
00:02:07 why it is said that the  The death penalty does
00:02:11 not make sense, it is better not to have it,
00:02:14 it is not very clear that it works, it
00:02:19 is not clear that it works, there is a lot of
00:02:22 data that indicates that it surely does not
00:02:27 work and I have been looking a bit I have
00:02:31 looked at some statistics and it is not
00:02:35 Very clearly there is research there are
00:02:38 articles that point to a good thing that
00:02:42 surely does not affect but there are articles
00:02:46 there is research in which it seems
00:02:50 that it does have some effect
00:02:53 but yes well if we say that it does not have no
00:02:57 effect we want to continue doing it
00:03:00 we want to continue killing people
00:03:03 because  many proponents of the
00:03:07 death penalty many people who say yes yes
00:03:10 we have to have the death penalty it is so
00:03:13 that in the future there will be no more criminals
00:03:18 if a person a person is thinking
00:03:21 I am going to steal or I am going to kill but they are
00:03:26 afraid they are afraid of the death penalty
00:03:29 maybe I didn't kill maybe in the future I won't
00:03:32 commit a crime I won't commit a crime like this
00:03:36 there is a death penalty but that is not very
00:03:39 clear  that this is really useful that
00:03:42 it is really applied and if it is useful but it
00:03:46 is of little use there are very few people who
00:03:49 change their minds who do not
00:03:52 commit a crime because there is a
00:03:54 death penalty I don't know it is really worth it or it
00:03:57 is not worth it we also have to think about
00:04:01 which one  is the purpose of a sentence what
00:04:05 is the objective of a sentence when a
00:04:08 judge says he sentenced you to one year in
00:04:12 jail one year in prison or ten years
00:04:15 or the death penalty or life imprisonment no
00:04:19 what is the objective of this system the
00:04:23 system of  judges of laws
00:04:25 the objective is that crimes are not committed
00:04:29 that in the future there are no
00:04:31 crimes the objective is that this person
00:04:34 the criminal the person who has done something
00:04:37 wrong changes the objective is that he change and
00:04:41 that in the future he can return to
00:04:44 enter society can
00:04:46 return to work do not commit crimes again that is
00:04:50 the objective or the objective is
00:04:54 revenge to take revenge on this person
00:04:57 this person has done me has
00:05:00 hurt me well I am going to take revenge for and we
00:05:03 will return it not that  it is the objective to take
00:05:06 revenge if a person has had
00:05:11 their husband or wife killed or
00:05:14 a child killed that person has the right to
00:05:17 take revenge it makes sense to apply the
00:05:23 death penalty to kill the person who has
00:05:25 committed the crime so that the
00:05:28 victims  feel good feel that it is fair that
00:05:32 the system is fair and if really for them
00:05:36 to feel for them to feel that it is
00:05:38 fair it is necessary to kill someone it is
00:05:42 necessary to lose a human life
00:05:45 especially because there are errors sometimes
00:05:48 the judges are wrong and
00:05:51 condemn  a person who was
00:05:54 innocent a person who has not committed the
00:05:57 crime who has not killed anyone and that is
00:06:01 good in recent decades in
00:06:05 recent years cases have been discovered
00:06:07 of a person who  she had already been
00:06:11 executed they had already killed her but then
00:06:14 there was evidence of DNA evidence of the DNA
00:06:18 that we all have in the cells of the
00:06:21 genes well there was evidence that it
00:06:24 was not that person it had been another person
00:06:29 if we were wrong if it is not 100% sure
00:06:34 who  we condemn and who we don't condemn
00:06:37 I don't know it's okay to kill innocent people it
00:06:40 's okay to kill innocent people if it
00:06:44 's only 1% or 2% it's okay
00:06:50 how much what percentage can we admit
00:06:53 we can accept killing innocent people and
00:06:57 another problem is the cost of money
00:07:00 money  What
00:07:02 does this cost I do not know if it
00:07:05 is the same in all countries but I know the case of the USA
00:07:10 and in the United States the death penalty costs more
00:07:14 than life imprisonment it costs
00:07:17 more money it costs the government more money
00:07:20 to the state to kill a person
00:07:24 for the  for the death penalty that applying
00:07:28 life imprisonment life imprisonment
00:07:31 means that this person can
00:07:34 never get out of jail again they can never
00:07:37 get out and it costs less money even
00:07:41 though there is  to give him a place to sleep and
00:07:43 food and everything costs less money than the
00:07:47 death penalty because well I do
00:07:51 n't know the case of the USA very well but
00:07:56 supposedly it's through all the systems
00:08:01 to make sure that person
00:08:04 has committed that crime the systems to  That
00:08:07 this person can
00:08:09 happen can continue trying to
00:08:11 defend himself, have several opportunities to
00:08:15 go to several judges, to several judges,
00:08:18 because the judicial system, the system of
00:08:21 judges, works like this, there are several levels, and
00:08:25 if you are not happy with what he
00:08:28 tells you, you can go to court to the judge.
00:08:31 there must be a system like this
00:08:33 to ensure that
00:08:36 the decisions of the judges
00:08:39 are well taken, what happens is that
00:08:42 with the death penalty, well, this ends up
00:08:45 taking a long time for the people
00:08:48 to whom they are applied  the
00:08:51 death penalty has to be
00:08:53 in jail for a long time and they spend more money for
00:08:57 all this use all this use of judges of
00:09:01 juries with a lot of work  by
00:09:05 the government and well, what I have told you
00:09:08 before, whether a sentence is
00:09:13 to reinsert him into society
00:09:15 or is it to punish or is it to
00:09:20 take revenge to take revenge and I think that
00:09:26 ideally we should try to
00:09:29 try to reinsert try  that this
00:09:33 person can go back to work,
00:09:36 live again and do no harm again, do not
00:09:39 kill anyone again, do not
00:09:41 hurt anyone again, but I don't know if
00:09:44 we really know how to do that, I don't know if we really have
00:09:48 our knowledge of
00:09:51 psychology and of ourselves  of
00:09:55 our brain allows us to reinsert
00:09:58 everyone because right now it is not
00:10:00 always like that, there are no people who
00:10:04 finish their sentences, they leave
00:10:07 jail and steal again
00:10:10 and there are people, there are people who are in
00:10:15 this situation, are poor or have  a
00:10:18 situation in life in which they decide
00:10:21 that the best or easiest option is to
00:10:24 steal or to commit a crime but there are
00:10:27 people who don't, there are people with a lot of
00:10:30 money who could  They still work on a lot of
00:10:33 things and they get out of jail and they
00:10:36 steal again and well, the same thing with murderers
00:10:41 and rapists, we also don't know
00:10:44 one hundred percent how to make sure that
00:10:47 this person does
00:10:49 n't commit a crime again, doesn't commit a crime to kill again.
00:10:52 someone to rape someone and I hope I
00:10:55 hope we move forward in the future but
00:10:59 as long as
00:11:02 we don't know as long as we don't know how to do that well what is the best
00:11:05 option
00:11:06 I'm against I'm against the
00:11:10 death penalty I don't think we should
00:11:13 choose okay if I go  a we are going to kill
00:11:17 this person we are going to kill this other person we are not going to kill this other
00:11:19 person
00:11:22 I do not think it is our duty
00:11:25 to choose that and that I do not believe
00:11:29 in god I do not believe there is a god that
00:11:32 there is  a god and that it is god who
00:11:34 decides, not the one who decides who lives and
00:11:36 who dies, but I don't know if I really am
00:11:40 a person, even though I am a very smart person, I am
00:11:43 a judge and can decide if
00:11:47 this person is going to die or not, especially
00:11:51 knowing  that are committed  mistakes that
00:11:54 we are human and many times when
00:11:58 the death penalty is imposed when
00:12:01 a criminal is killed it is not 100% sure
00:12:05 that he has committed that crime
00:12:07 that really is the person
00:12:10 who has killed or raped
00:12:12 and well tell me tell me what you think
00:12:15 you if you are in favor or
00:12:18 against the death penalty and what do you think of
00:12:22 my arguments about the reasons
00:12:24 why I think positive and negative things are good
00:12:27 if you
00:12:30 agree or not and then you
00:12:32 agree with the reasons why  For those of me who are
00:12:34 against the death penalty,

00:12:42 and if you want to learn real Spanish, don't

00:01:17 two men are dead they are dead
00:01:24 so you
00:01:27 have to ask questions
00:01:30 you have to keep asking questions and I
00:01:34 can only answer yes or no yes or
00:01:37 no and so on asking
00:01:41 questions you have to guess what
00:01:44 happened ok and be divine what happened
00:01:48 happened you are going to tell me you will tell me
00:01:50 if this happened of course
00:01:54 ok let's see
00:01:58 in the chess game
00:02:02 there is an obvious winner in the game in
00:02:07 the game looking in the game it will be seen  and it is seen
00:02:12 that if they have played and someone one of the
00:02:15 two has won now I do not know if one of the
00:02:21 two has the gun in hand if one
00:02:25 of the two men has the gun in
00:02:29 has a little long term but if he
00:02:32 has the gun  in the hand it's
00:02:34 okay and but there is only one gun if it's
00:02:39 only one gun then I suppose
00:02:42 there was only one shot
00:02:47 only not a balance is to ask ourselves
00:02:51 why only one person has pulled the
00:02:54 trigger of those two only one pulled the
00:02:56 trigger only one person did shoot
00:02:59 only one person shot
00:03:02 but they are both dead both are
00:03:05 dead so i guess
00:03:10 the person who lost shot to the one who
00:03:14 won and then waiting is worth 11 step
00:03:18 by step what do you want to ask the
00:03:21 person who won shot or the person
00:03:24 who lost shot the person  who won
00:03:27 committed suicide
00:03:30 before you said something else to me they
00:03:32 will ask me again the person who won
00:03:36 who won was murdered was murdered they
00:03:40 killed him if they were not betting something in
00:03:43 the game of chess in the game
00:03:46 bet  they aron something
00:03:49 yes
00:03:51 according to the result of the game because
00:03:55 one thing happened or something else happened we are going to
00:03:58 be on to happen something
00:04:01 the winner
00:04:04 murdered
00:04:07 the other player the winner shot and
00:04:10 killed the other player no who who
00:04:14 shot who of the two shots
00:04:15 winner and loser  the winner the
00:04:19 winner the winner and the winner
00:04:22 committed suicide later
00:04:25 after after murdering the
00:04:28 other the winner if one did not murder the
00:04:30 other no no
00:04:32 where where the winner shot
00:04:35 snails sparks
00:04:39 the loser committed suicide the loser no he did
00:04:47 not commit suicide I don't know no  he committed suicide he did not kill himself he did not
00:04:51 shoot himself he did not kill himself he did not
00:04:54 commit suicide snails
00:04:58 like how they died how they
00:05:01 died to see the winner pulled the
00:05:05 trigger
00:05:05 the winner fired a shot but did not
00:05:07 shoot although not what there is but to the
00:05:09 other although the  shot the winner
00:05:13 shot at the wall and the the bullet ricocheted
00:05:17 no he didn't shoot at the wall he shot at the
00:05:20 ceiling he didn't shoot at the ceiling and no or 6 but
00:05:23 also if he shot himself or the
00:05:27 winner
00:05:27 the won  r shot himself if the
00:05:30 winner committed suicide a loser is
00:05:32 dead because the loser
00:05:34 is also dead
00:05:37 because because he died because he took the
00:05:40 gun and decided to end his
00:05:43 suffering ornament loser took
00:05:47 the gun but he's dead but he's
00:05:50 dead  I don't know maybe I don't know it occurs
00:05:54 to me that I don't know maybe they were both in a
00:05:57 room and they were in a room and maybe
00:06:02 the winner knew
00:06:07 the way out of this problem and then he
00:06:14 this guy said yes yes you beat me if you
00:06:20 beat me  in the game of chess I
00:06:22 will tell you the key to get out of this room
00:06:25 so either this one didn't know how to
00:06:29 get out
00:06:31 no
00:06:32 no both of them both didn't know how to get out
00:06:36 how to get out like like one this one died how
00:06:41 that one died he shot himself the winner the
00:06:44 winner
00:06:44 the winner who has the gun
00:06:46 shot himself but the loser the one who lost
00:06:49 like how he died of confusion because he doesn't
00:06:53 know that this donation I think that from
00:06:55 confusion the humans
00:06:59 did not run out of oxygen in this room yes
00:07:03 the o  oxygen the oxygen in this room has
00:07:07 run out and this condition is not
00:07:12 worth it
00:07:15 well it's because it was because this
00:07:18 person who won there was a gas leak there
00:07:23 was no there was no gas here but just
00:07:27 breathing it's over the oxygen
00:07:31 is over or it's over no  well I don't know what happened in the
00:07:35 end it
00:07:38 is a valid option to ask
00:07:41 what happened one why not
00:07:44 because because the oxygen ran out
00:07:47 because symbolically this
00:07:49 subject represented the plants
00:07:51 the subject represented humans and
00:07:53 it is not something very abstract right no  They
00:07:55 are real, more humane people in a
00:07:58 situation. Well, realistically,
00:08:03 these people couldn't, they couldn't get out
00:08:07 because if this person or the two
00:08:10 people had been able to get out, that's it, they would
00:08:13 have been able to breathe, but they
00:08:16 couldn't get out because where they were,
00:08:19 where this is,
00:08:21 and our imagination
00:08:24 in a ship  spaceship
00:08:26 it's not a spaceship
00:08:29 in a space rocket it's a submarine
00:08:32 [Music]
00:08:33 it's not a spaceship yes it's a
00:08:36 submarine
00:08:38 how fast it is  It's fast, it's a bird, not a
00:08:43 submarine,
00:08:45 under the best sea,
00:08:50 okay, it's her husband,
00:08:55 this is a very big clue if they
00:09:02 don't know a submarine, they were playing chess
00:09:05 because they couldn't get out, they couldn't get
00:09:08 out because the submarine had no fuel.
00:09:15 enough energy
00:09:17 to make some fuel yes yes
00:09:21 it had fuel it had gasoline
00:09:25 never used to
00:09:27 yes yes it had nuclear fuel but
00:09:31 hey it's energy and it had energy
00:09:37 can I have one more clue one more clue let's
00:09:41 see
00:09:42 well I'll give you a clear clue
00:09:46 the submarine was was  damaged,
00:09:50 broken,
00:09:52 broken, I don't know, the submarine wasn't moving,
00:09:55 so the winner was going to
00:09:59 use the last bullet to end
00:10:01 his life and the loser had to
00:10:04 starve to death and oxygen, exactly, well,
00:10:10 yes, in the gun,
00:10:13 there was only one  bullet a bullet
00:10:19 only a bullet no
00:10:23 so he won well he committed suicide and he didn't
00:10:28 have to suffer he didn't have to suffocate
00:10:33 and he suffocated he ran out of
00:10:36 oxygen  and he had to suffer with that he had
00:10:42 won he had won the suicide that
00:10:45 went through history I have a riddle
00:10:47 for you which one is yellow on the inside and
00:10:50 blue on the outside yellow on the inside and
00:10:53 blue on the outside and blue on the outside
00:10:58 I don't know it's a police chick
00:11:01 I have another
00:11:03 what did a little egg say to a chick that is a
00:11:06 police officer a police chick
00:11:09 I have another one that a police chick said
00:11:11 to another police chick
00:11:15 what did he say we need support
00:11:21 very well thank you very much thank you because
00:11:25 also for your riddles it's okay and for
00:11:27 playing it's also difficult not these
00:11:30 they are challenges they are quite difficult these
00:11:33 enigmas ok ok well thanks thanks
00:11:37 for helping me and tell us tell us if you
00:11:41 like these enigmas and also tell us
00:11:44 if you guessed it if
00:11:48 you knew what was going on
00:11:52 come see you later
00:11:59 [Music]
00:12:00 and
00:12:02 [Music]
",3
084,"00:00:00 When someone asks me and you, Pablo,
00:00:05 how many years have you been studying Thai,
00:00:08 how many years have you been studying Japanese
00:00:11 , I know, I know, that person doesn't understand, they do
00:00:15 n't understand very well how languages ​​are learned
00:00:21 [Music]
00:00:25 Hello, yes, and the most frequent question I ask
00:00:30 people ask me about how I have
00:00:34 learned languages ​​is how many years
00:00:37 how many years have I been learning
00:00:42 I don't like I don't like this question
00:00:44 because I think the answer when
00:00:47 you get this question you
00:00:50 don't learn anything you don't know any new information
00:00:53 because I really think learning a
00:00:58 language  or acquiring a language is not counted
00:01:01 in years no matter how many years ago
00:01:05 you started learning and it
00:01:09 doesn't give you any information it doesn't
00:01:12 give you any information to know how many
00:01:15 years you've been learning but you don't
00:01:19 know how intensely how
00:01:23 intensely how often that  person has been
00:01:27 learning has been in contact with the
00:01:30 language has been getting used to the
00:01:32 language
00:01:34 for that reason  Well, I'm not, I'm not a bad
00:01:37 person when someone asks me,
00:01:39 I answer them because I've been with him, I don't know, for three years
00:01:42 with Thai or whatever,
00:01:45 but I also normally add,
00:01:49 but well, really, three years is like
00:01:53 saying four, Lee Bung and I don't know.  It is you
00:01:57 don't know anything unless I tell you how many
00:02:00 hours I have been in contact with the
00:02:03 language how many hours I have been
00:02:05 listening or reading the language
00:02:09 and I think we should change the
00:02:12 way we count and learn languages
00:02:16 and instead of counting in years count it  in
00:02:19 hours
00:02:21 and the problem with hours is that many
00:02:24 people, well, they don't know, they haven't counted, they
00:02:27 haven't counted how many hours it has been, so
00:02:30 it's a bit difficult for them to think
00:02:33 and count to see how many hours, but
00:02:36 many people do remember, well
00:02:39 I started in 2015 and it's easier but
00:02:44 I really think that it doesn't give you
00:02:46 any information and it's much
00:02:49 more useful it gives you much more information to
00:02:51 know that I've been 500 hours or I've been a
00:02:55 thousand hours
00:02:59 and I also believe  or that it's good for
00:03:01 people to really realize how
00:03:04 long it takes to learn a language because
00:03:07 if they ask you and you tell them or it's been a
00:03:10 year then they say it's fast only one
00:03:14 year in a year you've done maybe two
00:03:17 courses you've gone to  school two courses and that
00:03:19 's it and you no no no I have not done a thousand
00:03:23 hours in a year studied a thousand hours
00:03:26 is not the same and so people also
00:03:30 realize that well I'm not stupid I
00:03:35 'm not stupid because in a year  I have not
00:03:37 learned no no what happens is that I have not
00:03:40 spent the time I have not been
00:03:42 in contact with the language for the necessary time
00:03:45 this person studies more or learns is
00:03:48 in contact with the language for more time it is
00:03:51 normal that he learns more than me that I have
00:03:54 learned  faster than me
00:03:57 and people also realize
00:04:00 that maybe they should listen more or read
00:04:03 more, spend more time in contact with the
00:04:07 language and well, maybe if we change the
00:04:10 way we talk about the time
00:04:13 we've been learning a language and instead
00:04:15 of saying it in  years we say it  Well,
00:04:19 maybe we have a more realistic point of view,
00:04:23 we have a more realistic vision
00:04:26 of the process of how long it
00:04:29 really takes to learn a language
00:04:33 and, well, I'm going to start.
00:04:47 If you've learned Spanish,
00:04:50 tell me in the comments below, it's
00:04:52 worth putting how many hours you've been
00:04:54 studying Spanish or learning Spanish,
00:04:57 okay, bye-bye and if you want more

00:05:23 [Music]
00:05:24 ah
00:05:25 [Music]
",3
242,"00:00:00 hello now good today I am going to explain
00:00:03 why it is important to
00:00:07 pay attention to what you are looking at
00:00:10 to what you are listening to because it is
00:00:13 necessary to learn to improve
00:00:16 your Spanish but to listen to something
00:00:19 in the background to listen to something you
00:00:23 are not paying attention to
00:00:25 it's also a good idea
00:00:30 [Music] well
00:00:33 if I'm going to start with the simplest part
00:00:36 and that is if you are listening to
00:00:40 something and you are not paying attention to it
00:00:43 you are perhaps doing something else you are
00:00:47 working you are studying you are
00:00:50 doing something else that does require
00:00:52 your attention
00:00:54 you have to  pay attention to it
00:00:56 therefore you cannot be paying attention
00:00:59 to what you are listening to in Spanish
00:01:02 because you are not going to
00:01:05 acquire vocabulary you are not going to acquire
00:01:08 grammar because at no time
00:01:11 are you keeping in your head all the
00:01:15 sentence that you are listening to the context
00:01:18 you cannot dedicate mental space to it
00:01:23 think to see what topic he is talking about
00:01:26 if you do not pay attention to him yes I heard
00:01:29 sounds perhaps our brain
00:01:33 automatically identifies a
00:01:36 word or I have heard this word I have heard
00:01:38 that word but you are not going to understand
00:01:42 a sound or the general meaning of what
00:01:45 it is saying therefore you are not going to be
00:01:48 able to learn new words you are not going to
00:01:52 get used to it anymore  the grammar the
00:01:55 way to build sentences to
00:01:57 build phrases you will get used to
00:02:01 how it sounds it will help you to
00:02:03 get used to the sounds of the language it
00:02:06 is possible it is possible that simply
00:02:09 leaving it in the background
00:02:11 you will get used to how it sounds
00:02:14 understanding the sounds of the language I
00:02:17 don't think  It's necessary, I don't think it's
00:02:19 important, I've learned a
00:02:22 whole language, Thai, without ever
00:02:25 having background sounds that I didn't understand.
00:02:27 Okay, so if you spend enough
00:02:31 time
00:02:32 paying attention to the language, watching
00:02:35 understandable videos, listening to understandable audio,
00:02:38 that amount of time, I
00:02:42 think you've already  it is enough to
00:02:44 get used to the sounds of the language
00:02:47 to know how they sound  to the language and it is not
00:02:50 necessary well also to listen in the background to
00:02:54 listen when you are concentrating on
00:02:57 something else it is okay it may help it
00:03:00 may help with the rhythm it may help
00:03:03 with the pronunciation but there are not
00:03:07 studies
00:03:08 long enough to really
00:03:11 know if it helps if it helps  In a significant way,
00:03:17 another question that I also see, sometimes it's
00:03:20 useful to listen while I
00:03:23 'm sleeping, while I'm sleeping,
00:03:26 of course, it's better, what kind of
00:03:29 question is that, then
00:03:32 you can listen to things in the background.
00:03:40 I don't want to lose it I don't want to
00:03:43 lose what they're talking about I want to understand
00:03:46 what they're saying not when I hear
00:03:49 something that interests me I want to
00:03:51 understand it
00:03:52 normally I don't do it when I'm
00:03:55 doing something that requires
00:03:58 concentration I don't do it when I'm
00:04:00 working I don't do it when I'm
00:04:03 studying I don't do it when I'm
00:04:05 talking to someone of course and I don't do it
00:04:09 in another  There are occasions that also require
00:04:11 concentration, such as when
00:04:14 I am deciding what to buy in the
00:04:17 supermarket I am in the supermarket and
00:04:20 I have to decide whether I am going to buy this or
00:04:23 this I have to think and I have
00:04:26 realized that in this situation I am not
00:04:29 paying attention  to what I am
00:04:31 listening to, but there are situations
00:04:33 in which I am doing something
00:04:36 but what I am doing
00:04:38 does not require concentration, I can
00:04:41 do it quite automatically and
00:04:44 I can also be listening to something and
00:04:48 paying attention to what I am listening to, not
00:04:50 then this for  example is when I
00:04:53 cook when I'm cooking food
00:04:55 cooking dinner when I'm doing
00:04:58 the dishes or well cleaning the house
00:05:01 any kind of house cleaning
00:05:03 when I'm walking down the street
00:05:05 when I'm on public transport
00:05:08 when I'm in the shower taking a shower
00:05:11 when I'm brushing my  teeth
00:05:14 then I recommend that if you want to
00:05:17 pay attention because you are interested in
00:05:19 what is  If you are listening, you don't want to
00:05:21 miss it, so you should do it in these
00:05:26 situations, not in situations where you
00:05:28 have to pay attention to something else.
00:05:31 Still, I don't think it's a bad idea to have
00:05:35 something in the background, even if you're not paying
00:05:38 attention, I think it's a good one.  idea
00:05:41 because first
00:05:44 you have something that is always playing
00:05:47 maybe right now you are doing
00:05:49 something you are concentrating you are
00:05:51 choosing what you are going to buy in the
00:05:55 supermarket
00:05:56 but now for example you have
00:06:00 finished choosing you have put the things in the
00:06:02 cart and now you are walking towards
00:06:05 another area of ​​the supermarket now you don't
00:06:08 have to pay attention you don't have
00:06:11 to think about what you're doing so
00:06:13 you can pay attention maybe it's
00:06:15 a word or two you know and what you
00:06:19 hear takes you gets you into the story what
00:06:24 they are the subject of  they are talking
00:06:26 and you can take advantage of that time to
00:06:29 listen to situations like these that
00:06:32 happen a lot on a day-to-day basis, not at a
00:06:35 moment do we have to  We have to pay attention,
00:06:37 we have to think, and the next moment
00:06:39 you cannot do something that
00:06:43 does not require thinking, and you can pay
00:06:45 attention to what you are hearing, then,
00:06:48 when many times
00:06:50 a day you would have to think, you are
00:06:54 thinking and you stop thinking and start
00:06:57 doing  something that doesn't require thinking to
00:06:59 start listening to Spanish you would have
00:07:02 to remember so I was
00:07:04 learning Spanish I'm going to I don't know to
00:07:07 press play on the phone in the
00:07:09 pib headphones I'm going to press play to
00:07:12 continue listening or even have to
00:07:14 look for the phone  press play and such and
00:07:18 well, time is used less
00:07:21 and many times you end up forgetting and you
00:07:25 realize or today I have
00:07:28 not listened to any Spanish I have not listened to any podcast
00:07:30 in Spanish so to do something like
00:07:34 this this type of audio if I recommend something
00:07:38 that you do not mind getting lost, that what
00:07:42 we find interesting is better if it is
00:07:45 something that you like but that it is something that
00:07:47 if you do not listen to it well and if you do not
00:07:51 listen to it  Hey, well, well,
00:07:54 so what I recommend is having audios,
00:07:57 having podcast episodes, having the
00:08:00 audios of the Dreaming Spanish videos,
00:08:03 even audios of movies of movies
00:08:07 that you like, and having them in a loop,
00:08:10 having them in a loop that
00:08:12 repeats itself, because if not in  One
00:08:15 day there are many hours and even if you have
00:08:17 many files, well, in a fixed time
00:08:20 they run out and you no longer have anything to
00:08:22 listen to and you have to once again don't know how to
00:08:26 download or copy files or something and
00:08:29 then you can put them in a loop
00:08:32 because you won't go anyway  to
00:08:35 pay attention at all times
00:08:37 after a while after a few
00:08:40 weeks when it already sounds very
00:08:42 repetitive that is repeated a lot you can
00:08:45 change you can change the audios that
00:08:48 you have and well here is the video on
00:08:51 why you have to pay attention
00:08:54 when you receive the input
00:08:58 but it is also an idea to listen even if
00:09:01 you are not paying attention and I would
00:09:04 like the comments to also tell me
00:09:07 how you take advantage of  the day in which
00:09:10 ways do you try to receive a little more
00:09:14 input every day what tricks what advice do

070,"00:00:00 I have gone to see the movie Captain Marvel
00:00:04 and today I am going to tell you what my
00:00:08 impression is if I liked the movie or
00:00:11 not and I also went to see the movie in
00:00:15 4D and I am also going to tell you what I
00:00:19 think of the experience of 4D
00:00:22 but I'm telling you that I
00:00:27 [Music]
00:00:29 ah
00:00:31 well, first I'm going to tell you about the
00:00:36 movie of the movie of the movie
00:00:38 Captain Marvel and well first of all tell
00:00:42 you that
00:00:44 lately
00:00:47 I don't like superhero movies very much the last ones the
00:00:50 last ones I don't know five  years or so
00:00:54 of superhero movies the truth is
00:00:56 that I've been quite bored they've made a
00:00:59 lot of movies there are like three
00:01:01 different spider-mans and two together and a
00:01:06 lot of superheroes that I don't know who they
00:01:07 are I don't know there are a lot of
00:01:12 superhero movies that I  They bore me
00:01:15 and in this case, in the case of Captain
00:01:18 Marvel, perhaps it hasn't been so
00:01:22 boring because
00:01:26 in a certain way it
00:01:28 seems more like a science
00:01:31 fiction movie than a superhero movie,
00:01:33 there is quite a bit of the
00:01:37 movie that is  science fiction that
00:01:39 feels a bit like science fiction
00:01:42 and I think that has made it quite
00:01:46 interesting because there is a story and the
00:01:49 story continues in the story the
00:01:52 superhero or in this case the
00:01:54 superheroine has to save people and
00:01:57 such but it is not a  The story of saving the
00:02:00 planet is a little bit different.
00:02:03 I also thought that the story
00:02:06 was much more developed,
00:02:09 much better thought out than other
00:02:12 superhero movies, for example, I
00:02:16 saw the first Avengers movie,
00:02:19 not the Avengers in English, and it
00:02:23 seemed to me that  the story was very boring it
00:02:26 was a movie in which they fight and
00:02:28 fight and fight and little else is not very
00:02:31 interesting
00:02:32 but in captain marvel the story is
00:02:36 more interesting it is not predictable you do not
00:02:39 expect it there are some parts of the
00:02:42 story that surprise you and  That for
00:02:45 me makes a much more
00:02:47 interesting film much more fun
00:02:49 much more entertaining to see the way
00:02:53 the film begins I don't know I don't know if
00:02:57 It's the best, yes, it's the best way to
00:02:59 start the movie because it
00:03:01 starts already in the action when it starts
00:03:05 something is already happening but you don't know
00:03:08 very well who the people
00:03:11 are who the characters are because because they do
00:03:14 what they are doing
00:03:16 and I think it has  sense there is a reason
00:03:20 there is a reason why the
00:03:22 movie starts like this and it starts like this because the
00:03:25 protagonist the the main character
00:03:28 has
00:03:30 has amnesia she doesn't remember her past she
00:03:33 doesn't remember her past and that's why it makes
00:03:37 some sense it makes sense for
00:03:39 the movie to start  at that point and at the
00:03:44 moment in which the captain
00:03:47 marvel girl at the moment in which
00:03:50 she remembers her past is when
00:03:53 then the audience the spectators
00:03:55 also discover her past then
00:03:58 the story is told from the point
00:04:00 of view of the  protagonist and well it
00:04:04 makes sense but at first until
00:04:06 you start to know a little more you're
00:04:09 kind of lost as I don't really know
00:04:11 what's going on but hey  as
00:04:15 the film progresses you start to fit together
00:04:19 the different pieces of the puzzle
00:04:21 start to fit together and everything makes
00:04:24 sense and you end up leaving a good
00:04:28 good feeling of having known
00:04:31 what happened and why why did
00:04:33 that
00:04:34 happen and well how  It is a superhero movie it
00:04:36 is an action movie
00:04:39 there is a lot of action a lot of fights and
00:04:42 such but not too many there are not
00:04:46 as many fights like the avengers as in
00:04:48 avengers it is not the whole movie
00:04:51 just that but there are pauses there are
00:04:54 moments when
00:04:57 it pauses  pause the action to advance
00:05:00 the story to explain explain some
00:05:03 more of the story so the story continues
00:05:05 and there are pauses too that
00:05:09 help develop the characters where
00:05:12 the characters talk and it gives a
00:05:17 maybe more human feel to the movie it gives a
00:05:19 more touch  more emotional human and in that
00:05:22 sense it seemed to me that it is a film
00:05:24 that is quite balanced, it does not have a
00:05:28 fairly good balance of parts of
00:05:30 action and par  There are more emotional parts or
00:05:33 more parts of advancing the story. For me, one
00:05:38 of my complaints,
00:05:40 perhaps one of my biggest complaints about the
00:05:43 film, was the way they represent
00:05:48 space, how they represent the journey, traveling
00:05:51 to space or not, because at one point in
00:05:54 the film they have a plane.  They have a
00:05:57 plane and they adapt it to go into space,
00:05:59 which is good, it's totally
00:06:02 impossible, it can't be that a plane
00:06:05 has enough
00:06:08 fuel to go into space, it would
00:06:10 need a lot of energy, a lot of
00:06:13 fuel, not only to go into
00:06:16 space, but to go into space.  in
00:06:19 orbit because it goes into orbit around
00:06:21 the planet
00:06:22 so if you know anything about physics or
00:06:26 science and aerospace you will know how
00:06:31 good it is that it is totally impossible
00:06:33 but hey it is a science
00:06:36 fiction movie and it is not a very
00:06:38 big complaint it is not something that  make it
00:06:41 a bad movie
00:06:43 a little little complaint no and other than
00:06:48 that the actress the lead actress is the
00:06:51 girl i don't know i don't remember how s  Her name is
00:06:53 the actress but she represents Captain
00:06:57 Marvel, she does not represent the protagonist
00:07:01 and she had read, she had seen for a few months
00:07:05 on the internet people who complained
00:07:07 or laughed at her because she does not have many
00:07:10 expressions, she does not have a face that
00:07:13 expresses her emotions a lot, no, but
00:07:17 well  It seemed to me that it fits
00:07:19 her character quite well. She is a
00:07:23 character that is good, quite serious. She has
00:07:27 had a life that was angry. It has not been the
00:07:29 easiest life. She is a tough girl. She is a
00:07:32 pretty tough girl and I think that the
00:07:35 serious expression fits quite well.  with her
00:07:38 character but she is not always
00:07:41 serious when she has to laugh she laughs
00:07:43 well when she has to smile she smiles and she
00:07:47 is also a character who is quite
00:07:50 ironic that makes her quite ironic and
00:07:56 yes she has that ironic smile no and
00:07:59 I think it suits her well and  for me it was not
00:08:01 a problem it was not a complaint I think it
00:08:04 fits well with his character
00:08:06 and one thing that is quite interesting about the
00:08:08 movie is that it explains the origin of the
00:08:12 character nick f  ury nick fury appears in
00:08:15 the avengers in avengers' and he is an
00:08:18 important character in those movies and
00:08:21 here he explains his origin where the character comes from
00:08:24 and it is quite interesting it was
00:08:27 a look that is the same character that
00:08:30 comes
00:08:30 and that seemed curious to me it is something
00:08:33 I didn't know I haven't read many
00:08:36 comics either, I didn't know
00:08:39 this nick fury character or the
00:08:43 captain marvel character I didn't know
00:08:44 before I saw the movie and
00:08:47 that point of connection with the movies
00:08:50 that come later with the avengers
00:08:53 was  quite interesting
00:08:56 and good another interesting character in the
00:08:59 movie is the cat the cat or the cat the
00:09:02 cat if you see it if you see the movie
00:09:05 you will see in the cat don't see the cat don't
00:09:08 see and well one last detail of the
00:09:12 movie that is not I think  It's not
00:09:14 original to the movie, I think it already
00:09:16 existed in the comics,
00:09:19 in the previous comics, in the Captain Marvel comics,
00:09:22 this point already existed, but hey, it was
00:09:26 something that I
00:09:27 don't like very much and it's  On
00:09:31 puns I don't like
00:09:34 certain certain puns I don't
00:09:36 like very much and here they play on the
00:09:39 pun of a lady called amar
00:09:42 del with marvel and then she becomes
00:09:46 marvel and it was like I just don't like it
00:09:49 I don't like puns very much
00:09:53 , at least this
00:09:55 type of pun, not with
00:09:57 marvel, well, they get the girl's
00:10:00 name to be called marvel, like the brand, like
00:10:03 the comic book company, and well, for me, it's
00:10:07 something that wasn't necessary.  people who
00:10:10 don't care, surely many of
00:10:12 you don't care, it's not
00:10:14 something that important either, but hey, it's a
00:10:16 detail that gives me a bit of a thing,
00:10:18 no, I don't really like
00:10:21 puns, at least from this type and
00:10:25 well this is the end of me
00:10:29 and it is my impression of the film and now
00:10:32 I am going to explain my impression of the 4 of the
00:10:35 entire experience 4 of the film
00:10:38 and first well the 4d includes the
00:10:42 film in 3-d not and the 3d of  the
00:10:46 movie I think  It was very
00:10:48 good, it was very well done, they didn't use it
00:10:50 too much or they didn't use it excessively, it
00:10:53 was very good, I really liked it a
00:10:55 lot,
00:10:57 and I think it really added, it really
00:10:59 contributed to something to the film, it was
00:11:02 made better by being able to see it in 3D in
00:11:04 a  cinema
00:11:06 but 4d also adds other elements
00:11:11 and I don't know if that's the same everywhere
00:11:15 I don't know if it's the same in all countries
00:11:17 but I'm going to explain my experience
00:11:20 here in a cinema here in bangkok and my
00:11:25 experience is mostly negative
00:11:29 especially negative
00:11:31 I know that in the 4th before I think I
00:11:34 had seen a movie in 4d before
00:11:36 I don't remember what movie it was but I would say
00:11:39 that I had already seen a movie and
00:11:41 that time you got wet they poured water on
00:11:44 you there wasn't like any spray and you  they poured
00:11:47 water and here there was no water luckily I
00:11:51 don't know if it's because in the movie in the
00:11:52 movie there was something about if at some
00:11:54 point they entered the water but
00:11:57 I don't know if they got wet but well
00:12:00 you never get wet  At no
00:12:02 time do they spray water on you in this film and
00:12:05 that's fine, that's fine. I think that not
00:12:08 many people feel like having
00:12:11 spray sprayed on their
00:12:13 faces.
00:12:15 In that sense, it's better,
00:12:17 but well, there are many things that were
00:12:20 completely  unnecessary to begin with
00:12:24 always whenever the characters are
00:12:28 in a car or they are on a plane or they
00:12:31 are fighting the seat is
00:12:33 moving you it is shaking you like this
00:12:37 to me that was very unnecessary
00:12:40 especially when they are fighting it is
00:12:43 moving like this and like this and you  he is
00:12:46 hitting his back and I felt as if
00:12:49 someone was punching me
00:12:51 here in the back and it was very uncomfortable
00:12:55 for me and for me it was completely
00:13:00 unnecessary for them to move you so I shook you no yes
00:13:04 it is true that at some point
00:13:06 when there is a ship a spaceship
00:13:08 that comes out it shoots out that they make you
00:13:11 move like this it is very surprising it surprises you a
00:13:15 lot and that may be that it
00:13:17 is interesting that it adds add something
00:13:21 to the  movie not that they do something like that it
00:13:24 may be fine or that when you're
00:13:26 getting on the spaceship that ship
00:13:29 lies down that it lies down a bit the
00:13:32 seat may be may be fine that
00:13:35 may be interesting but
00:13:38 for me it doesn't add anything to the fact that it shakes you  It's very
00:13:41 uncomfortable and it doesn't contribute anything, it doesn't add
00:13:44 anything to the movie.
00:13:46 One part that is fine is the
00:13:49 vibrations, the seat vibrates
00:13:52 and when there is a
00:13:54 very, very low sound in the movie or there is something that is
00:13:59 shaking that vibrates, it's not fine for me.
00:14:02 It's very uncomfortable and he adds, it makes you feel more like you're
00:14:05 in the movie. It's quite
00:14:07 good
00:14:10 and maybe
00:14:12 at some point it did something
00:14:14 like air or something like that, it
00:14:18 can't be okay, but there's
00:14:21 something else that happened during the
00:14:24 movie  with 4 of this I don't know
00:14:27 why I don't know why it happened but at some
00:14:30 moments in some moments of the
00:14:32 film you could hear a
00:14:37 but that didn't come it didn't come from the
00:14:39 movie it came from around here and from behind and
00:14:42 when it did  he had like a smell there was
00:14:46 a very strong smell I don't know why I don't know
00:14:49 if the objective was the smell
00:14:53 or it was some kind of air or some
00:14:55 mechanism some compressed air or
00:14:58 something from the seat machine I don't know
00:15:01 why but it smelled very  bad it was a very
00:15:04 bad smell and I don't know if the goal was I
00:15:08 don't know if the goal was to make it smell
00:15:11 like roses but the roses were
00:15:14 rotten ok I don't know what's going on but I don't know it
00:15:18 was something I didn't like at all
00:15:20 and well that's it  this is the end of my
00:15:24 of my experience and for the film
00:15:28 above all above all a
00:15:30 positive experience and 4 x this I think
00:15:34 never again never again I'm going
00:15:37 to do it again I'm going to do it again I'm going to
00:15:41 go back  to go to a movie with 4 of x
00:15:43 is unless they improve it they improve it a
00:15:46 lot and start to see people say like this
00:15:49 yes yes that's fine then maybe
00:15:52 yes but until then I think no I
00:15:55 'm not going to see any other movies
00:15:56 with  on the 4th of this one
00:15:59 and well you do have experience
00:16:02 if you have been to see c  captain marvel or do
00:16:05 you have experience with 4 of 4 of x or whatever
00:16:09 it's called then explain it to me
00:16:11 tell us below in the comments
00:16:14 okay come see you later

221,"00:00:00 between 1808 and 1812
00:00:09 france and spain were fighting
00:00:14 france wanted to invade spain spain
00:00:21 was defending itself
00:00:24 then the countries of spanish america
00:00:30 saw it and thought
00:00:34 and this is mine and they began to try to become
00:00:40 independent separate from spain and thus
00:00:45 the spanish american wars of
00:00:48 independence began
00:00:54 [  Music]
00:00:57 hello, well, yes, the topic today is the
00:01:03 Spanish-American wars of independence and today
00:01:09 we are going to talk about the period between 1810
00:01:16 and 1820 9 if then, as I have told you
00:01:24 these years, there was the Spanish war of
00:01:28 independence from Spain against
00:01:32 France and in 1810 it was  When many
00:01:39 Latin American countries became
00:01:43 independent, in fact, the date
00:01:47 of independence of many countries is
00:01:51 very close.
00:01:53 Most of the countries fought
00:01:58 and fought in 1810, so why, why did
00:02:03 they become independent and how did it happen?
00:02:08 How was the process of becoming
00:02:12 independent?  now called latin america were
00:02:16 colonies or overseas territories or
00:02:21 have various names per  or they were colonies
00:02:25 especially of Spain, Portugal
00:02:31 and France and they were from Europe for
00:02:36 300 years more or less 300 years and during
00:02:41 all this time the Europeans had
00:02:44 been extracting gold and silver and exploiting it
00:02:50 to get food, not food and
00:02:55 spices so the inhabitants
00:02:58 people who lived in latin america
00:03:02 had begun to get tired they were already
00:03:06 tired they no longer wanted to continue with this
00:03:10 situation so the first colony to
00:03:14 rebel was haiti haiti that is here
00:03:18 haiti that is on an island is not haiti
00:03:22 and the dominican republic on an island yes it
00:03:26 was  the first colony to rebel to
00:03:30 say that they were going to become independent
00:03:33 and 50 percent
00:03:37 of the sugar from the sugar from the sugar
00:03:41 cane with which the sugar is made to
00:03:44 add to the coffee, for example, was
00:03:48 grown in haiti.  sugarcane for
00:03:52 slaves slaves from africa not slaves
00:03:56 that had been brought from africa then
00:04:00 haiti and had battles had to fight
00:04:03 for its independence from francis  a and
00:04:07 finally in 1795 haiti managed to be
00:04:15 independent it achieved independence
00:04:18 from france but in the case of the
00:04:22 spanish colonies it was a little different
00:04:26 then because they wanted to become independent
00:04:31 because they wanted to separate from spain in
00:04:35 many colonies in many places
00:04:38 only the
00:04:40 spanish could
00:04:43 only have important positions  Spaniards
00:04:46 born in Spain, born in Europe,
00:04:50 could hold positions of power, political positions,
00:04:53 and their children, the children of
00:04:57 people who were born in Latin America, well,
00:05:02 they did not agree with that, they
00:05:05 thought it was not fair,
00:05:08 the ideas of  The
00:05:11 French Revolution and the right to
00:05:16 knowledge are not the values ​​of the
00:05:19 Enlightenment and these ideas began to
00:05:23 be popular among the Creoles. The
00:05:26 Creoles were the children of Spaniards who
00:05:31 had been born in America. So
00:05:35 , the United States had also become independent a
00:05:38 short time ago.
00:05:41 had seceded from england
00:05:45 and this gave them the idea  As served as an
00:05:48 example that, well, he gave them an
00:05:51 example that they could also separate
00:05:55 from their country,
00:05:57 so in some of these countries they did
00:06:03 not like to depend so much on Spain,
00:06:06 having less rights than Spain, but even
00:06:10 so, they did consider themselves the King of Spain.
00:06:13 King Ferdinand the Seventh,
00:06:17 Ferdinand the Seventh, who was the King of
00:06:20 Spain, was considered their king,
00:06:24 but at this time,
00:06:26 Napoleon Napoleon Bonaparte removed the King
00:06:31 of Spain.
00:06:37 as king of
00:06:41 spain
00:06:42 if the americans no longer liked
00:06:46 spain and their king even less
00:06:50 liked having a french king a king of
00:06:53 france
00:06:54 then in 1810 the protests
00:07:01 began the problems began in three places
00:07:04 three places in america of spanish america
00:07:12 then these three places  they were new
00:07:17 spain'
00:07:19 new spain what is now
00:07:22 mexico and all of central
00:07:27 america new spain' new granada here new
00:07:32 granada
00:07:35 what is now  colombia
00:07:37 venezuela and then in peru chile and río de
00:07:45 la plata 'río de la plata' which is what
00:07:47 is now argentina argentina bolivia
00:07:50 uruguay paraguay or perú chile
00:07:55 and río de la plata so here is where
00:08:00 names appear known names of
00:08:05 people who fought for  the
00:08:09 independence of hispanoamerica in new
00:08:12 spain there is miguel hidalgo josé maría
00:08:16 morelos
00:08:18 and ignacio allende in new granada
00:08:21 simón bolívar was also well
00:08:26 known and here was bernardo
00:08:30 o'higgins and josé de san martín then
00:08:34 there were ten years ten years of
00:08:39 struggle for independence  to
00:08:41 separate
00:08:43 and most of them ended between 1821 and
00:08:52 1822 the wars of
00:08:57 independence ended then new spain became
00:09:01 independent at the beginning at the beginning it was
00:09:04 a country and it was what is now mexico
00:09:09 guatemala honduras el salvador nicaragua
00:09:13 and costa rica it was a country it was everything  a
00:09:18 country and two years later the countries of
00:09:27 central america separated from mexico and then there was chiapas chiapas was also for
00:09:30 a while  n a separate country but
00:09:34 later it joined mexico again now it
00:09:38 is part of mexico then new
00:09:41 granada at the beginning when it became
00:09:44 independent a big country was created
00:09:47 also
00:09:50 called great colombia and this was the idea of
00:09:54 simón bolívar
00:09:56 he wanted all the  countries of
00:09:59 latin america to unite to unite in
00:10:03 a single great country but even the great
00:10:07 colombia did not last long and ended up
00:10:11 separating it was divided into colombia ecuador
00:10:14 panama and see venezuela
00:10:17 in four different countries then the
00:10:20 dominican republic dominican republic
00:10:23 that is here they also wanted to
00:10:28 become  independent but haiti did not
00:10:32 want they
00:10:34 had to fight haiti
00:10:37 and the dominican republic fought the two halves
00:10:41 of the island until 1844 in 1844 the
00:10:50 dominican republic managed to separate from haiti
00:10:54 then puerto rico puerto rico
00:10:58 also wanted to unite
00:11:01 puerto rico here they wanted to unite with the
00:11:06 great colombia  But the US, let's see, the
00:11:12 US will not let it. The US made a treaty with
00:11:17 Spain to keep Puerto Ri  co and
00:11:21 now puerto rico is still
00:11:25 part of the usa although on the island of
00:11:29 puerto rico they mainly speak spanish
00:11:31 they speak spanish and now
00:11:34 in puerto rico they are still
00:11:38 discussing they are still trying to decide if they
00:11:42 want to be an independent country they
00:11:45 want to be a state within the usa  or they
00:11:50 want to be a territory the same as
00:11:53 up to now in the usa that is not part
00:11:55 of any state in the country then the
00:12:01 viceroyalty of the río de la plata' the
00:12:04 viceroyalty separated into uruguay paraguay
00:12:09 uruguay bolivia and argentina then
00:12:13 uruguay was invaded by portugal
00:12:15 portugal invaded uruguay but  shortly
00:12:20 after it separated from portugal
00:12:24 again uruguay became an independent country again
00:12:27 and that is how spain
00:12:31 lost most of its possessions in
00:12:36 america most of its territories
00:12:39 were not all we still had
00:12:42 some territories left if you know what
00:12:46 territories remained after 1822
00:12:52 say so  write it below in the
00:12:55 comments
00:12:56 what were the consequences of this
00:12:59 that happened p  or to obtain its independence
00:13:03 what things
00:13:05 happened the protection of spain over
00:13:10 trade until then there was a lot of
00:13:14 trade many ships coming and going
00:13:17 from america and spain protected them but
00:13:22 this ended then trade between
00:13:27 spain and the americas well it was
00:13:30 affected it affected it  not then the
00:13:35 countries of Latin America had to
00:13:38 adapt to be able to sell their
00:13:42 products what they produced to other
00:13:45 countries to the rest of the world
00:13:47 by becoming independent countries now
00:13:51 also each country could apply its
00:13:54 own justice have its own laws
00:13:58 their own judges could already do
00:14:01 what  I wanted them
00:14:02 not to depend on Spain' on the laws of
00:14:06 Spain and of course the creation of a
00:14:09 government
00:14:10 each country had its own government its
00:14:14 own president this does not mean
00:14:17 that now all of a
00:14:21 sudden Latin American countries treat their
00:14:25 indigenous population well, for example because
00:14:28 many  people who had the power who
00:14:33 had the money in the americas were
00:14:36 still of  descendants of Spaniards, in
00:14:40 fact, many people who fought for
00:14:44 the independence of their countries
00:14:47 were not people who fought for
00:14:51 indigenous rights, for the rights of
00:14:54 the people who lived there before the
00:14:57 Spaniards, but were children of
00:15:01 Spaniards or Spaniards who had gone
00:15:04 to  live
00:15:06 in Latin America and they thought they were
00:15:09 going to benefit that it would be better
00:15:12 for them to be independent not having
00:15:16 to pay taxes to Spain so the
00:15:19 treatment that each country gave to its
00:15:23 indigenous populations also depended
00:15:27 on each country and well it has been better or worse
00:15:31 and sometimes not very good what were the
00:15:34 consequences for spain what happened to
00:15:38 spain when it lost latin america'
00:15:41 well the first is the loss loss
00:15:45 of money loss of income from all
00:15:49 trade taxes loss of
00:15:53 raw materials from cheap access to
00:15:57 buy everything  that was taking place in
00:16:00 hispanoamerica loss of all this that
00:16:04 was the engine of war in spain
00:16:07 latin america was what helped him  He helped Spain to
00:16:11 have money
00:16:13 to pay for its wars in Europe,
00:16:15 so at this moment Spain is in
00:16:20 crisis, it is in an economic crisis and
00:16:24 in the 18th century, in the 18th century, well
00:16:29 , the Spanish empire is coming to an end. Spain
00:16:33 loses its strength worldwide.
00:16:37 his status as a world power
00:16:41 and the end of the
00:16:47 Spanish-American wars of independence is here. In the next video I will
00:16:51 explain what happened when the
00:16:55 war with France ended when
00:16:59 Fernando the Eighth and the Seventh returned Fernando the Seventh
00:17:03 and in the future in other videos I will
00:17:08 explain  Also, what happened to the rest
00:17:12 of Spain's possessions with the rest of the
00:17:16 territories that Spain is still
00:17:20 worth

00:00:05 hello hello everyone and well rather
00:00:09 caixa because today I want to talk to you about
00:00:13 the Basque Country you have probably already
00:00:18 heard things about the Basque Country but
00:00:23 if not today I am going to tell you a little bit
00:00:26 because I lived there for three years and it
00:00:30 is  one of my favorite places in the
00:00:33 whole world
00:00:35 well the basque country is an autonomous community it
00:00:39 is next to cantabria if it
00:00:42 is between cantabria and navarra
00:00:46 then it is an autonomous community with
00:00:49 three provinces vizcaya guipúzcoa and
00:00:54 álava and the capitals of those provinces
00:00:58 are bilbao which is  the capital of vizcaya
00:01:02 san sebastián which is the capital of life
00:01:05 of guipúzcoa and vitoria which is the capital
00:01:10 of álava and where i lived and something that
00:01:14 many people do not know is that the capital
00:01:17 of the basque country in general is vitoria it
00:01:21 is not bilbao it is  a mistake that many of us
00:01:25 make
00:01:26 and why
00:01:28 because bilbao is the best known city
00:01:30 yes but not the capital is vitoria
00:01:34 so i lived in vitoria for three
00:01:39 of my four years at university
00:01:41 so i remember  or
00:01:45 me before, well I wanted to study
00:01:48 translation and interpretation and I
00:01:52 wanted to because of the combination of languages ​​I
00:01:56 wanted to study
00:01:58 I decided that I wanted to
00:02:01 study the degree in Victoria because
00:02:04 they offered the languages ​​that I wanted
00:02:09 but the truth is that I was very
00:02:11 afraid to go because well the truth is
00:02:15 Well, I was 17 or 18 years old and I was
00:02:20 afraid of leaving home. I
00:02:23 had always wanted to see the world, but at the same time I
00:02:26 was young and I didn't know what was
00:02:28 waiting for me outside,
00:02:31 so I didn't like my city very much,
00:02:34 but  I was afraid of the unknown
00:02:37 and I was a little afraid because of the
00:02:40 stereotypes, well, not because of the
00:02:44 bad stereotypes that exist about the
00:02:46 Basques, well, there are many
00:02:49 bad stereotypes about the Basques, many people say
00:02:52 that they are closed or bad things are also said
00:02:56 because of the issue of terrorism.
00:02:59 for years because there is a
00:03:03 strong independence movement yes and
00:03:06 for years they have been a terrorist group linked
00:03:08 to it well then you hear
00:03:11 bad comments about the Basques  No, well, this did
00:03:14 n't worry me too much because I don't
00:03:17 like stereotypes, rather I was
00:03:20 worried
00:03:22 that they, the Basques, the people of the Basque country, would
00:03:25 have stereotypes about
00:03:28 people from Cantabria, specifically from
00:03:32 Santander, from my city, because
00:03:34 people also say bad things about us for
00:03:37 For example, it is said that in Santander we are
00:03:41 very cold, very closed, very superficial.
00:03:45 Yes,
00:03:47 perhaps there are quite a few people like that,
00:03:50 but I consider myself the opposite
00:03:52 so I was afraid that the Basques would not
00:03:58 want to be my friends because I am
00:04:00 from Santander and that bothered me a lot.  very
00:04:03 scared
00:04:04 and good when I got there what was my
00:04:08 surprise when I realized that this
00:04:12 had been the best decision of my life
00:04:15 because from the first moment I adapted
00:04:18 very well I fell in love with the life I had
00:04:21 in the Basque country' with the language of my  new
00:04:25 friends from the university of course,
00:04:29 I think that what makes us
00:04:34 like a place more or less many times
00:04:37 is the people and I love the Basques
00:04:40 And I often consider myself to be
00:04:44 good, I'm Cantabrian, but I seem more
00:04:46 Basque than Cantabrian. Yes,
00:04:50 for example, the Basques are said to
00:04:53 be very cold, but it doesn't seem that way
00:04:55 to me. It seems to me that they
00:04:59 are very very warm people with their friends, yes.
00:05:03 especially with their good friends
00:05:08 there are also people who say they are very
00:05:10 rude yes they say things without
00:05:13 thinking and but I think not what I think
00:05:17 is that yes they are natural yes
00:05:22 I also think they are more welcoming and they
00:05:25 are not superficial like  Many people in
00:05:29 Santander
00:05:32 don't have a very good heart in general,
00:05:36 but it's like
00:05:38 they followed them out of a good heart.
00:05:41 I don't like stereotypes, but in
00:05:43 general, those are the things I
00:05:47 can say about the Basques and then there
00:05:50 is the stereotype that the  Basques don't
00:05:52 flirt yes that especially
00:05:56 boys that boys don't know how to get
00:05:58 girls that girls don't want anything
00:06:01 with boys that's a lie yes because
00:06:04 I've lived there I know that boys
00:06:07 try to flirt a lot  Today and I know that the girls
00:06:11 also come a lot. Yes, that's not
00:06:15 true. Well, let's
00:06:17 go back
00:06:19 to my experience in Vitoria,
00:06:22 yes. Well, Vitoria is a more or
00:06:25 less small, comfortable city.
00:06:31 This city is known as the
00:06:34 green capital because it has many parks and
00:06:37 it was also the European capital of
00:06:40 culture a few years ago
00:06:43 so well I was there during my
00:06:48 first third and fourth year of
00:06:51 university in Spain the university is
00:06:53 four years but during the second
00:06:55 I was on Erasmus in London, so I was
00:06:57 only in Vitoria for three years
00:07:00 and well, yes, as I said, I was very
00:07:04 happy and I liked everything about my
00:07:07 new life, especially the people,
00:07:11 and I even learned the language
00:07:14 because I really like languages ​​and I
00:07:17 was in a place  in which an
00:07:20 isolated language is spoken that has no relation to
00:07:24 any language currently spoken
00:07:26 so of course I wanted to learn
00:07:29 it I learned it myself using the internet
00:07:32 and also  talking well with people and when
00:07:35 I left the Basque country' I did have
00:07:38 a pretty good
00:07:40 conversational level yes to talk about
00:07:43 basic things etc.
00:07:45 and well
00:07:47 when I lived in the Basque country' I
00:07:51 didn't travel much in the region because I
00:07:54 was a student I had  I had to study and
00:07:56 I had no money, but well, yes, I
00:08:00 did some volunteer work and
00:08:04 I also visited friends, so with these
00:08:07 things I was able to get to know some parts,
00:08:09 maybe I would have to make a
00:08:12 separate video to talk about all this,
00:08:15 but well, for example, I visited the
00:08:20 Biscay coast that I love yes places
00:08:25 like Bermeo which I think is one of my
00:08:28 favorites
00:08:29 I also visited emblematic cities
00:08:31 like Gernika known for the bombing
00:08:36 I also went to places in
00:08:40 deep Gipuzkoa places like
00:08:45 Tolosa Beasain
00:08:48 in Álava I'm not going to do much  I think later,
00:08:52 well, I was also in the north of
00:08:53 Navarra, which is Navarra, it is another autonomous community,
00:08:56 but since
00:08:58 Basque is spoken above all in the north,  He considers it
00:09:01 part of Euskal Herria, which is what the
00:09:04 Basques call their nation. If the Basque Country is
00:09:08 part of Navarra and the French Basque Country,
00:09:10 then I was also in the north of
00:09:12 Navarre and in the deep Navarre,
00:09:15 and well, of course, we have to talk
00:09:20 about food because  It is said that the
00:09:24 Basque Country has some of the best food in Spain.
00:09:28 If the gastronomy, the typical dishes
00:09:32 are very good and well known, and
00:09:36 the skewers are especially well known,
00:09:38 which are slices of bread, pieces
00:09:42 of bread with food on top, very elaborated
00:09:45 with great detail.  with many things and they are
00:09:48 especially famous in san sebastián but
00:09:51 in vitoria we also had and well I
00:09:55 think that is more or less my
00:09:59 experience yes as I say it was the best
00:10:03 decision of my life to go there
00:10:07 because I met great people
00:10:11 I had a great time  Yes, I learned many
00:10:14 things,
00:10:16 I was also lucky because Vitoria is
00:10:19 a city with a great university atmosphere, it
00:10:21 is full of young people
00:10:25 and, in general, I have very
00:10:29 positive memories.  I lived here from that stage and
00:10:33 I even got my first tattoo

",3
014,"00:00:00 hello good morning this is the third
00:00:05 advanced level video it is the third test the
00:00:07 third test that I told you that I was going to
00:00:11 do three different advanced video formats
00:00:13 to see which one you liked best and
00:00:16 with which shot in the future it is not
00:00:19 necessary to do only one  If there is more
00:00:21 than one that you like, well, that
00:00:23 's fine, also tell me in the
00:00:25 comments which ones you like and
00:00:28 today's video will be a video that will be
00:00:30 different from the other two because today
00:00:34 what is different is not the way
00:00:36 How do I speak but what am I talking about I am going to talk
00:00:39 about a series I am going to explain an
00:00:42 episode we are going to go step by step part
00:00:45 by part explaining an episode of a
00:00:48 television series so that
00:00:51 after watching this video you can go
00:00:54 watch the episode  look at the chapter that
00:00:57 I have explained to you and you understand it better, it will
00:00:59 help you to better understand what they are
00:01:01 talking about because you will already know the story
00:01:04 , you already know the parts,
00:01:06 you will know what they may be talking about and
00:01:10 I hope that it will be more  Thus, it is easy to understand
00:01:14 the Spanish they use
00:01:16 and that this serves as an
00:01:19 intermediate step to be able to begin to
00:01:22 understand series and understand
00:01:25 native films, films for native speakers,
00:01:28 authentic films or authentic Spanish that would be
00:01:32 said then, as you already know from the
00:01:36 title.  the name of the video I am going to
00:01:38 explain the first episode of the
00:01:41 paper house the paper house is a series
00:01:50 on netflix that in english i think they have
00:01:53 translated they have translated the title as
00:01:56 oman and jess i think it is iu but well in
00:01:59 spanish and the  original title is the
00:02:01 paper house is not a series in spain'
00:02:05 produced by netflix but in spain with
00:02:07 spanish authors
00:02:09 I think it is a very popular series it is a
00:02:12 series that many people like
00:02:13 many of you who watch
00:02:15 dreaming spanish too  You have told me
00:02:17 that you like the series
00:02:19 so today I am going to explain
00:02:23 the first episode part by part. If you have already
00:02:25 seen it, well, you can watch this video
00:02:28 and then watch it again and  Let's see if you
00:02:30 also learn more Spanish that way, I don't
00:02:33 recommend that when you watch the episode
00:02:35 you watch it or without subtitles or well, maybe
00:02:39 with Spanish subtitles but not with
00:02:41 English subtitles,
00:02:44 so let's start, oh of course, spoilers,
00:02:49 I mean, I'm going to spur you on the whole episode
00:02:51 .  say everything that happens so
00:02:54 if you don't want spoilers then maybe you can
00:02:57 watch the episode first and then
00:02:59 watch this video again and
00:03:02 then watch the episode again if you want
00:03:06 then the first episode starts and
00:03:09 introduces us to a girl  he introduces
00:03:13 a girl and the girl says his name is
00:03:15 tokio says his name is tokio tokio is
00:03:19 a weird man it's not a girl's name
00:03:21 because tokio is not a real man
00:03:24 then later we'll find out why
00:03:27 because he has that name because his name is
00:03:29 tokio  then we discovered that tokio is
00:03:33 a robber to a robber not with
00:03:36 with a gun he is dedicated to going to banks to go
00:03:40 to banks and rob rob banks rob
00:03:43 banks do bank robberies goes to a
00:03:46 bank and trying to steal the money is not
00:03:49 a robbery then we found out that tokio
00:03:53 had a boyfriend and with the boyfriend they were
00:03:56 robbing a bank and there was a problem and they
00:03:59 shot the boyfriend and the boyfriend died she
00:04:02 says she had left her boyfriend dead
00:04:06 in a puddle of  blood was all
00:04:08 surrounded by blood
00:04:10 and he died because a bouncer shot him
00:04:14 a bouncer is a security guard is
00:04:17 the security personnel that protects
00:04:19 stores in this case protects a bank not
00:04:22 the bouncer shot her and then she
00:04:26 shot and to protect her boyfriend  she killed
00:04:29 the security guard she killed the
00:04:32 security guard so that's why she says that
00:04:34 now she's a murderer before she was
00:04:38 just a thief only a robber
00:04:40 but now she's become a murderer
00:04:43 so we find out that she's
00:04:46 running from the police obviously if you've
00:04:49 killed someone it's normal that
00:04:52 the police catch you or you are going up and
00:04:55 after tokio talks on the phone
00:04:57 with her mother she goes to see her mother but a
00:05:01 car follows her a man who is
00:05:04 with  driving a car he starts talking
00:05:05 to her and tokio the girl says that
00:05:09 the man who is driving the
00:05:12 car says that his guardian
00:05:15 angel the guardian angel is an angel
00:05:18 a divine being not that protects us that
00:05:21 gives us security but  because it is not yet
00:05:24 known why because it is his
00:05:26 guardian angel but tokio says that he is surprised
00:05:30 even though he wears glasses it surprises them that his
00:05:34 guardian angel is in a seat panda
00:05:37 in a seat a seat seat is a
00:05:42 spanish car brand is a  car brand
00:05:44 that normally makes
00:05:45 quite cheap cars
00:05:48 and in this case it is a seat a seat ibiza
00:05:51 a seat ibiza is also a very
00:05:54 classic Spanish model but it is also
00:05:57 one of the cheapest basic models
00:05:59 within the seat brand and
00:06:04 also  This man is driving a very old Seat Ibiza
00:06:06 so this man
00:06:10 is his guardian angel because he warns
00:06:13 Tokyo, he tells Tokyo not to
00:06:16 go see his mother, not to see
00:06:18 her because his mother
00:06:21 is with the police.  n together with the
00:06:23 police and if he goes to see his mother well the
00:06:26 police are going to catch her they are going to arrest her
00:06:28 no then this man is the teacher
00:06:32 he calls himself the teacher I think
00:06:36 he is not a teacher but his name is
00:06:38 himself the teacher and the teacher
00:06:42 recruits tokio the recruit accepts her
00:06:47 as a member to do a heist to
00:06:49 give a stick they say they are going to give a stick
00:06:52 a stick is a robbery is to go somewhere
00:06:54 to steal money by force also
00:06:57 then tokyo  He agrees to accept the stick
00:07:03 but there are not only two people to
00:07:07 give this stick to do this robbery
00:07:09 but there are nine there are nine people
00:07:12 Professor
00:07:13 Tokyo is nine and these nine people are
00:07:17 going to live in a house they are in a house
00:07:22 all together
00:07:24 and they are together in  this house because they are going to
00:07:27 plan the attack they are going to plan him
00:07:31 the stick not the robbery they are here
00:07:34 planning and practicing training
00:07:37 to give this stick to give this to
00:07:40 do this robbery is going to be a very big robbery they are
00:07:44 going to try to steal a lot of money
00:07:47 and they are going to be in this house for five months they
00:07:50 are five months and they spend a lot of time
00:07:53 planning and preparing to launch the
00:07:57 coup to carry out this robbery so the
00:08:01 professor tells everyone that it is
00:08:04 forbidden to use his name that they do not use his
00:08:07 real name that they do not say  her
00:08:08 real name so we still don't
00:08:12 know we don't even know the name of
00:08:15 the girl from tokyo the name of the teacher
00:08:17 and the name of the others we don't know
00:08:20 yet
00:08:23 so
00:08:26 after talking a bit they decide that
00:08:29 each one is going to have a name  city
00:08:31 and the girl chooses tokio she says that it is
00:08:35 going to be called tokio and the others
00:08:38 well each one also chooses a name chooses
00:08:40 a different name from a city of a
00:08:43 city in the world
00:08:45 and another thing that is also prohibited
00:08:48 that the teacher says they do not have  what to
00:08:50 do that is forbidden are
00:08:52 relationships love
00:08:54 relationships love relationships between the different
00:08:56 members but well it seems that tokio
00:09:00 does not care much and from the
00:09:03 beginning
00:09:04 tok  io, well, he looks at a boy at the
00:09:08 river, I'm going to do it with curly hair, this
00:09:12 is river, no, and since the beginning,
00:09:15 since today I laugh, they
00:09:18 look at each other, and the river is the hacker
00:09:21 because in every series in  all the series
00:09:24 all the movies about robberies there
00:09:27 must be a hacker there must
00:09:29 be someone who is good with
00:09:31 computers no well in this one it's a river
00:09:34 so the teacher says that if this
00:09:39 robbery goes well if the stick goes well they are
00:09:42 going to be  some heroes are going to be heroes
00:09:45 of the people if they manage to do this
00:09:49 heist without hurting anyone without
00:09:52 hurting anyone or killing anyone they will
00:09:55 become the robin hood robin hood
00:09:58 as the legend of the good archer
00:10:03 of great britain  England that
00:10:06 stole money from the rich to give it
00:10:09 to the poor, no, well, the teacher says
00:10:12 that if they do this robbery well, they
00:10:15 will also be heroes of the people,
00:10:18 so where are they going to find so much
00:10:21 money? Where are they going to steal so much money?
00:10:24 r the efe in m&amp;t which is the
00:10:30 national currency and stamp factory the
00:10:34 fnmt is the place in spain
00:10:37 where money is made
00:10:39 where bills are made where bills are made
00:10:42 before pesetas and now
00:10:45 euro bills are made in the
00:10:47 fnmt national currency and stamp factory
00:10:49 so there will be a lot of money and
00:10:53 they are going to steal they are going to steal the fnmt
00:10:56 so the first episode does a
00:10:59 flashforward it does not advance in time very
00:11:02 quickly and you can see the nine that
00:11:05 are preparing to do  the robbery and they
00:11:08 are on their way getting ready they are already on their
00:11:10 way they are in a van on their way
00:11:12 to commit the robbery they
00:11:15 are all wearing Dalí
00:11:19 masks they are wearing Dalí masks by the painter Dalí
00:11:22 and they are not wearing the masks or masks
00:11:24 so their plan is to get into a truck
00:11:28 there is a truck a truck that every week
00:11:32 takes paper to the fnmt takes the paper
00:11:36 where it is going to be printed the bills are going to be printed they
00:11:39 took paper money paper
00:11:41 which is called which is the paper that is  It is used
00:11:44 for tickets so
00:11:47 the truck will be guarded by two
00:11:51 police cars it will be protected it will be guarded by
00:11:54 two police cars these police cars are
00:11:57 called zetas zetas
00:12:00 simply because of the letter zeta
00:12:02 what are police cars called zetas
00:12:05 of the national police because in
00:12:08 Spain there are several police forces there are
00:12:11 local police regional police and there is the
00:12:13 national police which is not like or perhaps
00:12:16 like the fbi in the United States but more
00:12:18 seedy I don't know then the zetas are the
00:12:22 police cars and the truck was going
00:12:25 guarded is protected by the two
00:12:28 cars and their plan the plan of the
00:12:30 robbers is to get into the truck
00:12:33 because that way with the truck they can get
00:12:36 into the national currency and
00:12:38 stamp factory without being discovered without them
00:12:40 knowing that they are going to rob the then there is
00:12:45 the  convoy not from the truck there
00:12:48 is the truck with the two
00:12:51 police cars and they stop it in the convoy and
00:12:56 kidnap the driver here is the
00:13:00 driver of the truck and there are also
00:13:02 policemen not
00:13:04 and he  They kidnap them, they point
00:13:06 guns at them, they steal their clothes and well, and they
00:13:12 distribute themselves, they get in, some
00:13:15 get into the police cars,
00:13:17 some get into the truck too
00:13:20 and put their things inside the truck, they
00:13:23 put things they need, they put
00:13:25 equipment, they put weapons and others  things
00:13:29 they need then the episode introduces us to
00:13:33 a girl another girl
00:13:36 a young girl a 17 year old girl a very
00:13:40 very young girl who is on a school trip she
00:13:42 is on a school bus trip
00:13:46 with her classmates
00:13:48 this girl
00:13:51 does not have  name her name is unknown
00:13:53 for now but they call her little
00:13:57 lamb the muggers call her the
00:13:59 little lamb so for now I
00:14:01 'll call her the little lamb
00:14:03 a little lamb is a sheep is a
00:14:06 little sheep ok so
00:14:09 the girl a 17 year old girl is
00:14:13 on a trip with the school they are going to visit the
00:14:17 fnmt with their schoolmates they are going to
00:14:20 visit the fnmt
00:14:23 they look quite posh their school
00:14:26 I think a schoolboy is quite posh  or
00:14:27 surely private because they are all in
00:14:30 uniform and well, he also
00:14:33 explains to us that there is a boy
00:14:35 there is a boy who asks the girl to
00:14:38 be boyfriends and such and the girl says that if
00:14:40 not then we go to see the interior of
00:14:44 the fnmt se  see inside the factory
00:14:50 let's say this is the fnmt we see
00:14:54 inside the factory there is a woman and
00:14:57 there is a man
00:14:59 and the woman tells the man that she is
00:15:01 pregnant she has a baby she is pregnant
00:15:04 she tells him that she is pregnant pregnant is another
00:15:07 other  way of saying that she is pregnant
00:15:10 but well she is pregnant but the
00:15:13 man has a wife and children he already has a wife
00:15:17 and children
00:15:19 so the robbery begins
00:15:22 some of the robbers enter the
00:15:26 truck hiding hidden in
00:15:29 the truck and tokio and another and another girl
00:15:33 enter through the  front door
00:15:37 and the robbery begins they start pointing
00:15:41 their weapons at people and put on their
00:15:44 masks
00:15:45 some wear masks others new
00:15:47 ones put them on later
00:15:49 and then they start looking for him
00:15:52 little lamb they start looking for the
00:15:54 young girl in the factory but they can't find
00:15:57 it hard to find the girl but
00:16:00 finally tokio finds her tokio
00:16:04 finds her with the boy the girl and
00:16:06 the boy were in a bathroom doing things
00:16:08 but tokio finds her and takes
00:16:13 her  take you to where the other
00:16:15 robbers are then i also introduce you
00:16:19 to berlin berlin is the head of the
00:16:22 operation no the professor is the
00:16:25 organizer who has organized everything
00:16:28 but berlin is the one who directs the action
00:16:31 inside the factory
00:16:34 because the professor is far away
00:16:36 talking well communicating with a
00:16:39 cable I think they put a cable they put a
00:16:42 cable to be able to talk to be able to
00:16:44 communicate without using telephones without using
00:16:47 walkie talkies so that the police do
00:16:49 n't discover them no
00:16:51 then the professor is not in
00:16:54 the fnmt factory and there in  the
00:16:59 factory is running the operation is berlin and
00:17:03 berlin gives a talk to everyone gives
00:17:05 a talk to the hostages the hostages are
00:17:09 the people who have been seceded  Shown to
00:17:11 people who are not free to
00:17:14 leave, they have been kidnapped, those are
00:17:16 the hostages, and Berlin tells the
00:17:20 hostages that if they behave well, if they do
00:17:22 everything they are told, they will not
00:17:25 be harmed and that they will come out alive because they
00:17:27 do not have  to be afraid that they are not going to
00:17:30 die so we also see moscow
00:17:35 moscow and denver
00:17:36 moscow and denver
00:17:39 moscow and denver are father and son yes they are
00:17:43 father and son and the son
00:17:46 the son I don't really know why he is
00:17:48 here I think  it's because he's his son
00:17:50 because he's moscow's son but moscow is an
00:17:55 expert with safes he knows how to
00:17:58 open safes not a safe it
00:18:01 's a metal box with maybe a
00:18:04 code a code with numbers and maybe a
00:18:10 key or something but it's  a
00:18:12 very hard metal box where you can keep money and
00:18:15 valuables of great value
00:18:19 because moscow is an expert in opening safes
00:18:24 in the fnmt there is what is called a
00:18:28 vault a vault is
00:18:31 like a safe but big very
00:18:33 big  it's big enough
00:18:36 for a person to get inside
00:18:39 to get in it's more like a
00:18:40 room like a closet no so
00:18:44 it looks like moscow and denver are there
00:18:48 trying to break open the vault
00:18:50 and they succeed
00:18:52 moscow gets to open the vault
00:18:54 and there well  a pile of euros there are a
00:18:57 lot of euros and we see how
00:19:00 denver gets to be happy and
00:19:03 lies down on top of the money and maybe not
00:19:05 then the episode
00:19:08 flashbacks a little bit back to the
00:19:11 moment when they were in the house
00:19:13 and he explains to us that tokio and que rio had
00:19:17 a loving relationship even though it
00:19:20 was forbidden because they had a
00:19:22 relationship and they had been sleeping
00:19:24 together they had been [ __ ] when they
00:19:27 were at the house almost every night
00:19:30 most nights and later we discovered
00:19:34 something more about the plan of  What plan do they have in
00:19:37 the factory in the FNMT, how are they going
00:19:40 to get so much money because
00:19:43 they don't just want to escape with the
00:19:46 money they could have taken?  gone the money that
00:19:49 was in the vault and they
00:19:50 took care to have escaped but they don't do that
00:19:53 what they do is activate the alarm if
00:19:58 they purposely activate the alarm they
00:20:00 make the alarm start to sound neither
00:20:03 no nor no no nor no nor no how would it be  an
00:20:07 alarm reigns ground
00:20:10 and it starts to sound like the
00:20:12 alarms sound which I don't remember how
00:20:13 an alarm sounds but the alarm starts to sound
00:20:15 or they are robbing us they
00:20:18 are robbing us and the police of
00:20:20 course find out and come to the police they
00:20:24 have  done on purpose they have made
00:20:26 the police come but because in this
00:20:28 episode we still won't know why
00:20:31 why they did that but their plan is to
00:20:33 wait for the police to come and
00:20:36 then go inside and close the door
00:20:39 and the police will think that  they are
00:20:42 cornered that the police think that
00:20:44 they cannot escape from there that they think
00:20:47 that the plan has gone wrong that there has been
00:20:49 some problem and the plan has gone
00:20:51 wrong then the police arrive but there is
00:20:56 a problem
00:20:57 tokyo  the tokio girl doesn't wait long
00:21:00 enough gets out
00:21:03 too soon gets out soon gets out
00:21:05 starts shooting at the police
00:21:09 and rio gets out behind her goes out to look for
00:21:12 the wait waits you go too soon
00:21:14 then the police get out of the car
00:21:16 start shooting they start shooting
00:21:18 each other
00:21:20 and the girl  policeman shoots river gives him
00:21:24 river hits river in the head somewhere he doesn't
00:21:26 see very well but blood is coming out of his
00:21:28 head
00:21:31 and tokyo is also shooting they also
00:21:33 want a policeman at least one of the
00:21:36 policemen is wounded in the end they manage to
00:21:39 get in  They manage to get into the FNMT, they
00:21:42 close the door, but laugh, well, he's
00:21:46 wounded in the head, it seems he's
00:21:49 dead, I'd say he's dead, and well,
00:21:52 it's already started badly, no, their plan has already been
00:21:55 screwed up. Let's see what's going to happen,
00:21:59 so this is it.  the end of the episode
00:22:02 the end of the first episode of the
00:22:04 paper house and now you can go to netflix to
00:22:08 watch it or I don't know if you can see
00:22:11 the series somewhere else and watch the first
00:22:15 episode and see if  after
00:22:17 seeing this you understand it a little more you
00:22:20 understand a little more what happened what's
00:22:22 going on and you also understand the vocabulary a little more
00:22:25 the words they use ok
00:22:28 come see you later
00:22:31 ah
00:22:35 [Music]
00:22:36 and
00:22:37 [Music]
",3
219,"00:00:00 well here we are a second day with the
00:00:03 city of cities skyline trying to
00:00:07 create the happiest city being
00:00:14 a good mayor not a good mayor
00:00:16 taking care of our population here our
00:00:19 citizens and let's see let's see if
00:00:22 we can get the happiest population here
00:00:27 [Music]
00:00:30 well we have to do
00:00:34 all this housing areas and let's see I'm going to
00:00:38 demolish this
00:00:40 tree bad tree
00:00:42 housing areas it's not that the
00:00:45 size has remained strange here
00:00:48 perhaps because of the shape it has remained here it
00:00:52 's strange like a space here perhaps it's
00:00:55 because of the shape  the shape of the land but
00:00:58 well this is developing very
00:01:01 quickly here I am going to leave I am going to start
00:01:04 roads here just in case because if
00:01:08 not then they complain to me that I
00:01:12 break the houses and such and such and here
00:01:14 I will also start so that it can be seen clearly here  like
00:01:18 where the next street begins and don't
00:01:20 build too many houses and here I'm going to build
00:01:24 more more houses no not all of this
00:01:27 I want a square area also from here
00:01:31 to here
00:01:34 very good and here too  Very quickly they
00:01:36 start building houses to build houses they are
00:01:39 going to say they are going to need stores
00:01:42 soon I will put stores here stores
00:01:46 here stores here and that could also
00:01:50 be stores I am not sure I lack water
00:01:53 I am sure I lack water
00:01:57 well for now not for now  so it
00:01:59 arrives it arrives here here I can make a zone
00:02:03 that I can make a commercial form also
00:02:06 put more stores commercial zone are
00:02:10 stores we can't do here that they are they
00:02:12 are all shops all this and this I'm going to
00:02:17 paint here paint better very well here
00:02:21 they will start making shops there is a  little
00:02:23 demand for houses they still still
00:02:25 want more houses I have money no I don't
00:02:28 have money what can I do I'm going to make
00:02:31 room for a road here two for
00:02:35 a road and I can do more
00:02:37 houses here 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and here again 4 5
00:02:44 6 7 8 and here to build more houses and there
00:02:48 I will also need water and 4 and 8
00:02:52 and here too
00:02:55 and now if I need water, sure
00:02:59 from here and from here and now from
00:03:02 here I put everything and and
00:03:05 Ok if they already have water if there is
00:03:08 water available good treatment
00:03:10 everything is fine I just need money
00:03:14 what I lack is money so I have seen
00:03:16 two things I can raise taxes they are at
00:03:21 9% and I can I can also take loans
00:03:25 ask for money you have to pay it have
00:03:28 interest but of course in the future I'll earn
00:03:30 more money and it's easier to pay it don't
00:03:33 come I'm going to apply for a loan
00:03:35 so we've said we're going to be
00:03:39 good we're going to be good mayors
00:03:41 so we don't want to raise
00:03:45 taxes a lot but good to provide good
00:03:47 services
00:03:48 surely yes  It's a good idea to raise them
00:03:51 a bit to put them a bit, from what I
00:03:54 've read I've seen someone playing I think
00:03:56 they put it a little higher I don't know if they
00:03:58 were around 13 or so but good to
00:04:01 change it a bit I think it's going to be fine
00:04:04 to continue well and it will help us to
00:04:07 make people happier how we make
00:04:09 people happy of course that is the most
00:04:12 difficult thing, not what people need to
00:04:14 be happy well that is very philosophical
00:04:17 but  I think that in this game it is
00:04:20 clearer here happiness happiness the
00:04:23 population is happy very well I don't know if there
00:04:26 has to be more information there
00:04:28 no no there is no measure
00:04:31 well there the city can be more
00:04:33 attractive attractive for tourists
00:04:36 this is for the  people visit but
00:04:39 because there are many tourists it does not
00:04:42 mean that people are going to be happy not to
00:04:45 see if people want more place
00:04:49 to live so there is because because
00:04:52 I have to break this to see
00:04:55 what happens here what happens what happens here
00:04:59 picturesque village good  I have grown and
00:05:02 I have many things now laws districts
00:05:05 firefighters police and firefighters police is
00:05:09 good not special and
00:05:12 industry specialization police stations and firefighters and
00:05:14 police well I will need firefighters and
00:05:17 police to new areas wait now to be
00:05:20 able to use areas sorry I have to
00:05:23 break this I have  What to do here a
00:05:25 road so I'm sorry I know you
00:05:28 're getting angry but I don't know I don't know
00:05:30 how to do this and here I don't also
00:05:33 have to break it because  Hey
00:05:36 and I would have to make roads before
00:05:39 before
00:05:41 selecting them the zones zone this is going
00:05:44 to be all residential residential zone
00:05:48 here paint all this I am this is going to
00:05:51 be residential and this and this okay
00:05:54 then
00:05:56 roads first first roads
00:05:59 a road if too long I'm going to
00:06:02 make it  Too long just in case and
00:06:05 here, well, I'm going to do it that way, it's not ideal,
00:06:08 but here it's not flat, the terrain
00:06:11 isn't flat, so I think
00:06:14 there's always some separation between the
00:06:17 squares here, but well, no, nothing happens
00:06:21 before assigning zones.  I'll build roads
00:06:23 I'll build more roads and it should already
00:06:27 be fine the water made sure there's a lack of
00:06:29 water so I'm going to put water here I
00:06:33 don't know what is the optimal way to bring
00:06:35 water to the sites
00:06:37 now I'm going to do it that way ok districts and
00:06:41 their industrial specializations the
00:06:43 industry can  take advantage of them okay yes
00:06:47 I do forestry
00:06:49 I can do they can use the forest no
00:06:53 so here for example
00:06:56 how I do it laws I have laws a  here is it
00:07:01 specializations of districts districts
00:07:03 delete district paint district paint
00:07:07 district paintbrush okay and what do I have here
00:07:11 forest industry okay so he painted
00:07:14 a district first
00:07:16 and then I say that this is going to be a
00:07:19 forest area what is here general industry
00:07:22 okay is this forest area I don't know no
00:07:26 It's clear to me there's industrial
00:07:29 industry industry then
00:07:32 forestry district is this I don't know it's not
00:07:36 clear sunbathed let's see yes
00:07:40 it looks like they're here
00:07:42 using using it for agriculture
00:07:46 I don't know let's save the trees
00:07:48 deforestation of course that's what's happening don't
00:07:52 remove  districts is that this has not made
00:07:55 any sound or anything I do not know if
00:07:59 it has really paid attention to me
00:08:01 if I can change this agriculture guarantees
00:08:04 yes yes it has not changed you see there the
00:08:06 symbol is of the tree here yes yes yes
00:08:09 it has changed it okay well yes  yes it has
00:08:12 worked what else we need a bit
00:08:14 of everything where I can see statistics
00:08:18 of what is here I am in these areas I can see
00:08:24 the crime they have or firefighters  this is for
00:08:27 fires, well, let's see, it would be nice not to
00:08:30 have firefighters and a police station,
00:08:33 there will be something good in the end, it's needed in all
00:08:37 cities, it seems that people are
00:08:39 happy, so I'm going to put a decade,
00:08:43 well, people are happy, crime, the
00:08:46 police patrol, okay, no  I know I would like to
00:08:49 see the crime how much crime there are
00:08:51 special buildings we don't have for
00:08:54 now there is nothing where I can see
00:08:56 crime statistics and such houses
00:09:00 people want more houses how many houses do
00:09:01 you want more and more people want to live
00:09:03 here it's good I guess it means that at
00:09:06 the  people like the water company and
00:09:10 there are places without water let's see where
00:09:12 where it is here I'm going to put roads
00:09:17 just in case I want to
00:09:19 connect then more houses here I'm not going
00:09:24 to build four only not here I can
00:09:27 do everything here yes here  yes I have
00:09:30 to be careful here is the next
00:09:32 road so no if it looks good and more
00:09:36 houses there are no parks I don't have parks
00:09:38 parks and squares I need 1200 people I
00:09:41 almost got there  Let's wait I'm going to
00:09:44 wait because I can remove the twitter
00:09:47 here it bothers a bit not the twitter here let's
00:09:49 see it's fine because it tells you what
00:09:51 people think but little town 1200 very good
00:09:56 parks and squares
00:09:58 landscape design I can modify the
00:10:03 terrain it's okay to do that  Go up, go down, very
00:10:06 well, different parks, parks and leisure areas,
00:10:08 canals,
00:10:10 buildings, park, playground, the
00:10:13 institute, the institute, and library,
00:10:17 sports, garden, well, it's fine, an
00:10:22 institute is needed so that
00:10:24 people can learn at a higher level,
00:10:29 where is it here, study, what's there
00:10:32 institute and library we can put
00:10:35 here to see here we break things not
00:10:39 here if we break something we can put here
00:10:43 an institute where the institute goes to
00:10:46 the institute yes it comes a lot and spends it
00:10:50 is far away but perhaps better here yes
00:10:53 or even here here yes it does arrive  a lot, a
00:10:56 lot of places, well, I no longer have money
00:10:58 for the library, the library, it's 22 thousand
00:11:02 oysters, that's a lot of money, I'm going to have to
00:11:04 start paying back the money  from the
00:11:07 loan let's see where my loan is here
00:11:09 loans you can ask for three
00:11:12 loans I have to pay 16 thousand that
00:11:16 I can I can pay it already pending payment is
00:11:19 going up I have to pay it at
00:11:21 once I have to pay it all well I'm going to
00:11:23 pay it before it goes up let it go up  more
00:11:26 I'm going I can grow of course here is the
00:11:30 issue with a loan I can grow grow
00:11:33 very fast but it also means that
00:11:38 I am not concentrating on making
00:11:41 people happy that people are happy not
00:11:44 good services okay maybe I can stop
00:11:48 here I can pause people have  It has
00:11:51 work I can concentrate on
00:11:55 people having an education They have parks Let's
00:11:59 see the parks Now the parks are going to
00:12:01 cost money
00:12:02 1,200 A playground and a
00:12:07 small park are cheap I'm going to put some
00:12:09 parks Yes Let's see where I can put a
00:12:13 park here What here  There won't be
00:12:15 room for a road later
00:12:18 I'm going to put a couple here that's good
00:12:21 everyone everyone liked it and
00:12:25 then a children's playground
00:12:26 I can put it here s  It's a children's park,
00:12:29 too, a lot of people are
00:12:33 happy here, I can also put one to see and
00:12:36 now all these people are happy, very
00:12:38 well, there are different colors, which are the
00:12:42 colors, maybe it's the people
00:12:47 who use the garden who use the garden
00:12:51 let's see I have missed here road
00:12:54 I forgot to put roads here
00:12:56 how am I going to do this clear here it
00:12:59 connects it does not connect very well
00:13:02 I am going to break here a little I am going to
00:13:05 break this to put here a garden
00:13:09 a park a park  Here I am going to put a
00:13:12 park the parks are cheap and many
00:13:15 people who are happier not with a
00:13:17 park that is red what does it mean
00:13:20 because it is red now now it is
00:13:23 improving okay maybe there is something else what
00:13:26 is this channels landscape design can
00:13:30 do channels channels  with water let's see let's
00:13:33 see let's see I don't know if it's me people are going to
00:13:37 be happier with a canal with a canal
00:13:40 I don't know the water what happens with the water the water doesn't
00:13:43 come okay okay let's see from here
00:13:46 to here okay the  water goes to  always be
00:13:51 the most difficult I have to think and
00:13:54 always thinking about putting water very
00:13:57 well
00:13:59 so I can see what people
00:14:02 think education
00:14:04 primary secondary how can I see
00:14:07 happiness
00:14:08 the happiness of people these are goals
00:14:13 areas
00:14:15 help information good people are
00:14:19 happy no  Let's see people, I don't know if they
00:14:23 can still be happier, many
00:14:26 people ask me for houses, but of course they ask for
00:14:29 houses because more people want to live here,
00:14:31 but maybe the way to be
00:14:35 happy is and even isn't to live in a
00:14:38 small city, this could improve.
00:14:42 Going slowly, creating schools, a
00:14:47 university, for example, and improving the
00:14:50 industry in the future, you can build an
00:14:54 industry, let's see where the industry is, an
00:14:56 industry that pollutes less office area,
00:15:00 industry
00:15:02 here like offices, but for offices
00:15:07 I need 6,500 people
00:15:10 to process 1 incineration maybe in the
00:15:15 future I can  have more
00:15:16 more modern cleaner ways of
00:15:20 processing garbage
00:15:22 but i need to reach goals i need
00:15:25 that that  the city is bigger than it is
00:15:29 these monuments I don't need it to be
00:15:32 much bigger
00:15:33 special buildings
00:15:35 I need population
00:15:38 4200 bigger if I need more
00:15:41 population many goals in this game
00:15:44 are based on population so yes
00:15:48 even though be patient
00:15:51 and don't get a lot of money why not
00:15:54 I get a lot of taxes from people it's
00:15:57 hard to improve no at least I want
00:16:01 a university that I need 6500 people for
00:16:03 university
00:16:06 so yes I'm going to have
00:16:09 to grow a little well come on let's go let's
00:16:13 grow a little like we do this so
00:16:16 here I have space  In order to grow,
00:16:19 maybe I would have to build another
00:16:22 residential district where people could live
00:16:25 here, not because it's going to be very close to
00:16:28 the garbage and the noise from the
00:16:33 companies.
00:16:39 get another
00:16:43 district but I don't know how to do this
00:16:46 I can add spaces to see where this is
00:16:51 and look I can add a zone well
00:16:56 maybe I can grow po  r here and then of
00:16:59 course, whatever it is,
00:17:02 I'll have to build bridges to
00:17:04 cross the river here. How about
00:17:07 here? There isn't much area to take advantage of
00:17:09 here.
00:17:17 there are plenty of places to grow there are trees but of
00:17:22 course trees and parks are not the same
00:17:24 people are not very happy either to
00:17:27 have trees what can i do i can build
00:17:31 houses here in the end they will
00:17:34 be near the school they will be near the school and
00:17:36 so on so here i have four  I can
00:17:40 do
00:17:42 here in this direction
00:17:44 also connect this
00:17:48 and here I can come back again I can
00:17:52 go back to make this elongated shape
00:17:57 if I can go back here and make this shape
00:17:59 here connect a little like this here again
00:18:03 connect like this and here also connect like this
00:18:07 if there is one left here  a little
00:18:09 different way but well it will not be very
00:18:13 difficult for people to
00:18:15 move around and I can finally make more houses
00:18:19 here and here they will also ask me for common
00:18:24 areas  Merciales I would put it here in the middle and of
00:18:27 course I don't want to have it all filled in
00:18:29 here and then I don't have space for
00:18:32 schools and such but well schools and
00:18:35 services I can put them later here
00:18:38 on both sides I'm going to remove the rock
00:18:42 I don't want to be crazy here and here  houses
00:18:48 good houses here also here more houses
00:18:51 or how good I'll wait to put here
00:18:54 things you need if I need more
00:18:55 schools or something and for now I'll put houses
00:18:59 here here I'll put houses very good that more
00:19:04 water I'm sure I need water of
00:19:07 course here water here  for now it
00:19:11 's good I can finish refilling this
00:19:14 well here I already have there shouldn't be a lack of
00:19:17 water unless here it's full let's see
00:19:20 how you are with water
00:19:23 normal operation maybe here I can see it
00:19:27 availability treatment very well
00:19:30 everything is perfect if I don't have much
00:19:32 population there are not many people well here
00:19:35 we are we are already finishing this
00:19:38 second video
00:19:40 of making the perfect city I have seen
00:19:43 that well we will have to grow a little

00:00:04 or the
00:00:06 island soul today I want to talk about a topic and
00:00:11 I want you to give me your opinion because there
00:00:13 is something that I don't like at all and I want
00:00:16 you to tell me what you think that you
00:00:19 don't like it either if you're found or
00:00:21 not  and it is
00:00:25 cosmetic surgery cosmetic surgery
00:00:29 wants to know if I am for or
00:00:31 against yes because I don't like what do you
00:00:35 think well I think that cosmetic surgery
00:00:39 can be very beneficial for
00:00:44 some people it can be very good
00:00:47 okay yes that the  It will make you feel better
00:00:51 if you, what do you think, tell me why you are
00:00:55 against it, let's see, I don't want it to be banned,
00:00:59 I'm not going to tell anyone, I'm not going to
00:01:02 let you have the operation, I didn't want it to be
00:01:05 prohibited to make it illegal or anything,
00:01:08 just not  I like it and I think that
00:01:14 the main reason why I don't
00:01:16 like it is that many times I don't like
00:01:19 the results, no, it's not well
00:01:23 done, basically, it's okay,
00:01:26 yes I understand it, there are other reasons, I'll
00:01:31 also talk about other reasons, but a very
00:01:33 important is what  And sometimes I see famous people,
00:01:36 famous actresses and such and I say
00:01:40 wow, what has been done to the face is
00:01:43 uglier than before, not
00:01:46 if I understand it perfectly and I think
00:01:50 that many times when I see someone
00:01:53 who has had surgery and I think, my goodness, what a
00:01:56 horror  I was much better before,
00:02:00 but I think that
00:02:04 many people think like you
00:02:08 because they don't realize that many
00:02:12 people
00:02:14 have cosmetic surgery and have an
00:02:18 operation and it's so well done that you
00:02:22 can't tell they've been operated on, okay,
00:02:25 maybe the ones that come out  well, we don't realize it, we do
00:02:29 n't see them
00:02:31 clearly, there are many people, in fact, I have
00:02:34 seen, I like to see videos sometimes of
00:02:37 plastic surgeons who explain things and
00:02:41 say the most important thing about a
00:02:44 plastic surgery or
00:02:47 aesthetic medicine procedure is that it is not  It is noticed that
00:02:50 a person sees you and tells you today you are
00:02:54 very well but they can't tell you because they
00:02:57 know I don't know why you are very handsome or you
00:03:01 are very pretty but I couldn't say why
00:03:05 and suddenly they make you  a
00:03:08 nose job and they leave you with a super super small nose, well,
00:03:11 everyone will have it,
00:03:15 but there are people who have surgery and it doesn't
00:03:19 show that much, okay, it can be mostly
00:03:23 people I don't know who are seeing them
00:03:25 for the first time and who  They have had surgery and
00:03:28 I don't realize it, not if it's a person
00:03:32 I know and something has changed and she has
00:03:35 become prettier because I think that more or
00:03:37 less everyone who knows her
00:03:39 would notice, no yes and possibly
00:03:43 everyone  The world would notice, yes,
00:03:46 because if you know a person's face very well
00:03:50 and suddenly the next day
00:03:53 the person has
00:03:56 a different face, he has some different trait,
00:03:58 if you're going to notice that's
00:04:02 true, then there's the maybe ethical issue
00:04:06 of good, it's a lie, no.  it's something natural it's
00:04:09 not you really no
00:04:14 yes maybe this for me is maybe less
00:04:18 important but well it's still something
00:04:20 I tend to prefer something natural no if
00:04:25 you know I understand it too
00:04:28 somehow I think it's also better to
00:04:33 be more natural and for me in  This
00:04:37 sense
00:04:40 is a bit confusing because
00:04:45 I personally don't like men who
00:04:48 have cosmetic procedures.
00:04:50 I don't like men
00:04:52 because they pluck their eyebrows or
00:04:56 men who wear makeup or
00:04:58 are very like it's in
00:05:03 men who  Some cosmetic surgery is
00:05:06 done to make the
00:05:08 jaw less square or something like that
00:05:11 that men do, yes, well,
00:05:15 I'm not very sure,
00:05:18 I haven't looked, I haven't looked for this
00:05:21 information, but I imagine that many
00:05:25 men have nose surgery, men
00:05:28 who  They are not happy with their nose, they
00:05:31 think it is too big and
00:05:35 not in Ávila, if there are men who
00:05:40 might be bothered by that
00:05:43 and they have surgery on their nose, I also imagine
00:05:46 that what you say about no to the
00:05:48 jaw I think is very difficult to
00:05:50 operate that are very, very complicated operations of
00:05:56 course, exactly, but yes, for example, there is
00:06:00 something quite common that is the
00:06:02 chin implant
00:06:05 to have a slightly more pronounced chin, it is
00:06:08 worth it  Yes, at
00:06:13 least here in Asia, women often
00:06:15 make their chins point
00:06:18 like this because many Asian women
00:06:21 have very round faces
00:06:24 and then they put on a
00:06:28 little more chin with a little more peak to
00:06:30 have a face  a little more elongated if
00:06:33 what you say is like extend it all the
00:06:35 way down make it more
00:06:37 if it extends down a little
00:06:41 forward too so the profile
00:06:44 your chin looks a little bit bigger
00:06:46 also a little further forward board and i
00:06:50 think maybe  That is a
00:06:53 fairly common operation in men to have
00:06:56 a common goal, a more masculine face
00:07:00 perhaps, but
00:07:03 I think that obviously women are the ones
00:07:07 who get the most plastic surgery
00:07:10 , yes, and what happens when a
00:07:14 woman has had many things done and, let's say,
00:07:16 she  It turned out well and she is very pretty and
00:07:18 such and then but she was very ugly she was a
00:07:21 very ugly person and then she has children and
00:07:24 the children are ugly
00:07:26 and that is very tragic it
00:07:31 is normal
00:07:35 yes of course it is normal and it happens  A lot is something
00:07:41 very normal because I see it with the
00:07:45 children of famous people,
00:07:47 even well, for example, stick, I don't know if,
00:07:51 well, if you know very well the face of
00:07:55 Queen Letizia, the Queen of Spain, well,
00:07:58 more or less, Queen Letizia was a
00:08:02 journalist before, and you  You can see the
00:08:05 images of her face when she was a
00:08:08 journalist on Spanish television and
00:08:13 presenter of the news, yes, exactly,
00:08:16 she presented the news and now she sees
00:08:19 her face and it's
00:08:21 totally different, it's totally different, well,
00:08:24 perhaps I haven't seen and I haven't seen
00:08:27 recent, more recent photos, for sure.  that
00:08:32 if you google queen letizia before and
00:08:35 after you will see the dramatic change
00:08:38 she has had
00:08:40 surgery and chin surgery but not to
00:08:43 put on but to take off if she had a
00:08:47 face a bit like a witch with a
00:08:49 nose like that a bit  long and her chin a
00:08:52 bit long
00:08:54 and now she looks like a doll and I
00:08:57 think of her daughters for example the eldest daughter
00:09:02 who is going to be because the future queen
00:09:04 is supposed to be them and the infanta leonor l
00:09:09 I think Princess Leonor, well, maybe
00:09:13 she looks a bit like her mother, maybe in the
00:09:17 nose and I don't know now because she's
00:09:21 still very young and when you're a teenager
00:09:24 your face has very, very soft features
00:09:28 but over time, it might
00:09:32 look similar  a little more to his mother
00:09:35 normally mothers tell their
00:09:38 children that they are the most handsome no but
00:09:41 how do you tell everything to your son that he is very
00:09:44 handsome if he has your face
00:09:46 you have not allowed to have that
00:09:49 protected face you changed because you did not like it of
00:09:52 course  An interesting topic that you have
00:09:55 mentioned before is that of
00:09:59 self-esteem. Something that I have read
00:10:01 is that there are many things you can do
00:10:05 to try to improve your life, not only
00:10:07 cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery and not
00:10:10 even just talking about
00:10:12 appearance, but any change.  in your
00:10:15 life of having a girlfriend boyfriend husband wife
00:10:18 having more money than almost any
00:10:21 change in your life you end up
00:10:23 getting used to it and after a year and a half you
00:10:26 feel at the same level of happiness that
00:10:29 you felt  before,
00:10:31 except if you make the
00:10:34 biggest boobs that they say by law or somewhere
00:10:38 I don't know I don't know how they have
00:10:40 measured it if the study is very reliable and such
00:10:43 but it seems that they asked about it and that the
00:10:46 effect of getting bigger breasts on
00:10:49 making you  silicone boobs well that it lasts a
00:10:52 long time or I don't know or forever I don't know
00:10:54 that it keeps being happier and happier
00:10:59 I don't know I don't know
00:11:01 if I understand that we get used to everything
00:11:05 and a person can think when I got a
00:11:08 nose job I'm going to be much happier
00:11:11 but  in the end you get used to it
00:11:13 well what does this mean that we
00:11:16 should not try to improve because
00:11:19 we will always be on the same plane of
00:11:22 happiness or unhappiness what does
00:11:25 that mean I don't know anymore what I
00:11:28 wanted to concentrate on was the breasts
00:11:32 but 6  I think it was good, we could
00:11:35 also talk about
00:11:37 happiness,
00:11:38 look now, it's not so fashionable to wear
00:11:43 bigger breasts, but now what
00:11:46 's fashionable is to have a very
00:11:48 big ass like this,
00:11:50 so the boys lie  ras has done a
00:11:52 lot of damage
00:11:54 what is it called that really like that in
00:11:56 incarnation
00:11:57 if
00:12:01 the other day I was talking to my sister
00:12:04 what she was saying or I see many asses operated
00:12:08 on on the street and yes yes the truth is that I
00:12:15 don't know if now before the breasts were more
00:12:18 big now is the biggest ass I
00:12:21 don't know I don't know what the long-term effect
00:12:24 of a person's happiness is but I
00:12:27 think that there are people who live
00:12:30 with a complex that has a very
00:12:33 big complex that feels very, very insecure
00:12:36 about something  her physique due to a
00:12:40 very large nose, very large ears or
00:12:44 women who have nothing at all, no chest, well,
00:12:46 I don't know, I don't see what's wrong with
00:12:51 having surgery, not me, with the issue
00:12:53 of the breasts, it's also the fact that
00:12:56 I've  I have seen many, well, that they are not
00:12:59 well made, it is very noticeable that they are made of
00:13:02 silicone, they
00:13:03 are very ugly, no, yes,
00:13:08 you know personally, it is complicated,
00:13:12 because, Pablo, the truth is that
00:13:15 I would be very disgusted to be with a man
00:13:20 who has implants.
00:13:23 abd implants  ominal or personal is the best, yes,
00:13:26 and women of color also feel like women,
00:13:31 and of course there are men who
00:13:34 do these things to themselves and you would be disgusted
00:13:37 because you know they are there or is it that
00:13:41 you would not like to be with the type of person
00:13:44 they are  She would do that kind of operation or
00:13:47 that she cares so much about those things, well,
00:13:50 both
00:13:52 yes, but
00:13:55 on the other hand, I think that in women it
00:13:58 is more normal or not, what do you think, it
00:14:02 would disgust you to be with a person who
00:14:05 has implants, an implant with ass tits.
00:14:08 I don't know I've never never
00:14:13 touched them in real life so I guess
00:14:17 it depends on how I feel like
00:14:20 being with a plastic
00:14:22 doll or a rubber doll no
00:14:26 so it seems to me like the kind of person
00:14:28 who would  would do is not the type of
00:14:31 person that I would normally like
00:14:34 but I can imagine it's okay because she's a woman you
00:14:37 know and even though she cares a
00:14:40 lot about her appearance and she has done
00:14:41 this for other reasons I do like her
00:14:44 and I am in love  her  or whatever
00:14:47 is good, I imagine that
00:14:50 the situation could arise in which it is
00:14:53 good that he could be with
00:14:55 a woman like that, not
00:14:58 to support him and I don't like the idea and
00:15:00 I would never tell a woman or you would be
00:15:04 Prettier if you did this to yourself, you know, of
00:15:08 course, of course, I understand it, and what would you do
00:15:11 if your wife told you tomorrow,
00:15:16 hey, I want to have my boobs operated or I
00:15:19 want to make my ass bigger, how would
00:15:21 you react, let's see, I wouldn't like it, of
00:15:24 course, and it broke down, yes, I know  I would say it
00:15:27 so I don't think it makes
00:15:30 sense to hide my opinion and not tell her
00:15:33 what I think because no, I mean I don't
00:15:36 think my opinion is important to
00:15:38 women in general, but well, if she's
00:15:41 my wife, I think so, at least
00:15:43 Knowing my opinion
00:15:44 should know. Oh yes,
00:15:48 I don't think my wife has an obligation to
00:15:53 do what I tell her and to take it into
00:15:55 account, but well, at least she knows and she
00:15:57 knows that if in the future
00:15:59 my opinion of her has somehow changed because of
00:16:02 that, well.  let him know in advance
00:16:06 I mean, you would tell her that you don't want her to
00:16:10 do it but I wouldn't expect her
00:16:13 to listen to you I would like her not to
00:16:16 do it but
00:16:18 not if she decides to do
00:16:22 it I wouldn't be mad at her either because she
00:16:25 didn't listen to me but still what she
00:16:28 what has been done is what has been done and
00:16:29 I will be seeing it every day and if
00:16:32 I don't like it I don't like it and I won't be able to
00:16:33 change how I feel from that change that
00:16:37 has been made in my body
00:16:39 yes yes how I feel  It depends on what
00:16:42 has been done and how big it is and
00:16:46 how badly or well it turned out.
00:16:51 Yes, of course, I like it, maybe it turns out well, and I
00:16:56 like it. I don't know, but of course,
00:17:00 you know that there is a television program
00:17:03 where two
00:17:06 American surgeons
00:17:09 attend only to  patients who have
00:17:13 already undergone surgery and have been left unwell
00:17:17 and they
00:17:20 tell me so that I can show it to my
00:17:22 wife yes in the future if I want to do
00:17:24 an operation no well
00:17:26 yes because that program can
00:17:30 dissuade you it can make
00:17:33 you think  I'm going to change my mind I
00:17:36 'm not going to v  I am going to accept my body because
00:17:39 you really see that you can look bad,
00:17:44 you can look bad, for example,
00:17:47 in this program there are many people who
00:17:51 go there who have had a nose job and of course
00:17:55 the nose is a very important part of the
00:17:58 body because you breathe through your nose and
00:18:01 when  you know when you have a cold and you
00:18:04 can't breathe you suffer a lot brno of
00:18:08 course it's not only something aesthetic but it
00:18:10 has to work well they have to
00:18:11 follow it
00:18:13 and when you have surgery when normally
00:18:17 people who have surgery have surgery to make
00:18:20 their nose smaller and then sometimes
00:18:24 the nasal septum falls and they can't
00:18:28 breathe and they have to go and what these
00:18:32 surgeons in this program do
00:18:35 is make the nose bigger again
00:18:39 with cartilage from another part of the
00:18:42 body and make the nose
00:18:45 bigger again so that the person  we can
00:18:47 breathe
00:18:50 so yes that is a problem yes
00:18:53 then I think it is very important if
00:18:57 you have surgery go to a super super
00:19:01 good surgeon but of course then it will be more
00:19:04 expensive,
00:19:06 what do you think of the ethics of you think it
00:19:11 is cheating to get cosmetic surgery and
00:19:15 what do you think you are cheating who if we say you
00:19:20 find a partner
00:19:23 let's say you find if you find a partner
00:19:26 you should tell him that you have had
00:19:27 cosmetic surgery I think that if I think
00:19:32 it is important with a  couple
00:19:35 especially be totally honest and
00:19:38 say well look I had a nose job or
00:19:42 whatever, why not because
00:19:45 you are going to do it ethically maybe although there
00:19:50 may be people who say that
00:19:52 ethically if you have to say it because
00:19:55 your partner is going to think that  your children are
00:19:59 going to be
00:20:00 like you so in that part I understand
00:20:05 that a person may think you have to
00:20:09 say it but I think that simply because of
00:20:12 the couple because the couple has to
00:20:14 share those things they don't have to be
00:20:18 honest if I am to see if I
00:20:20 completely agree  I agree that not
00:20:24 only do I think that it is a good idea in
00:20:26 general because it is something that, as
00:20:27 you say, can affect how your
00:20:30 children will be, but also  Because in general, I
00:20:32 do want to communicate a lot with my partner
00:20:35 and say things that are even less important
00:20:38 than that, but that will help the
00:20:41 other person know what kind of person
00:20:44 I am, not of
00:20:45 course, of course, I think it's important to
00:20:49 be honest with your partner, but
00:20:53 with the rest of the world because I don't think
00:20:57 you shouldn't you don't owe them you don't
00:21:01 owe others anything you don't have to
00:21:04 say
00:21:05 that you've had surgery, for example, many
00:21:08 celebrities deny having surgery because you can, you do
00:21:13 n't have to
00:21:16 talk about it with  people who are
00:21:19 nothing to you yes I agree with that a
00:21:22 famous person who, although he leaves, earns a
00:21:24 living with his appearance who is an
00:21:28 actor actress singer I don't think it is
00:21:31 necessary to reveal if he has
00:21:33 had an operation or not of
00:21:37 course  It's good, let's see, I was going to talk about
00:21:40 beauty pageants and those
00:21:43 already have many problems and there is a lot of
00:21:45 debate, but do you think that in a
00:21:49 beauty pageant people who have undergone surgery should be admitted?
00:21:52 yes, in that case
00:21:56 I think so because you are
00:22:00 judging beauty and in the end that you
00:22:05 achieve beauty by some means and perhaps you have
00:22:10 achieved beauty because with you you have
00:22:14 dyed your hair or you have put on highlights you
00:22:17 have put on makeup or I mean because
00:22:20 There are make-up and yes, it
00:22:23 is always admitted, of course, so that it is
00:22:26 admitted that it is admitted and that it is not admitted.
00:22:29 I think that either everything is admitted or nothing is
00:22:32 admitted and you judge beauty as it is,
00:22:37 the extremist suit of course, well, it exists, it is
00:22:41 extremist, yes it is true.  but I think that
00:22:44 why not admit cosmetic surgery
00:22:48 if you are admitting, for example, you are going to
00:22:51 admit that a person has had
00:22:53 braces on their teeth or they have
00:22:56 veneers on their teeth to have
00:22:59 them whiter, that is accepted, it
00:23:02 is a bit good, I think that  everything
00:23:06 comes in, I don't understand the same anymore, let's see,
00:23:09 I think it's good, basically, as long
00:23:12 as the rules are clear, I
00:23:15 don't think there is a problem either, and if there could
00:23:19 be contests for women, maybe
00:23:22 natural and contests that admit
00:23:25 cosmetic surgery and such not to what you
00:23:28 say about comparing if cosmetic surgery
00:23:30 with having braces on the
00:23:32 teeth not to fix the teeth well
00:23:35 yes I do not think there is a
00:23:38 clear dividing line but I think that
00:23:43 and people  Do you feel that there is a
00:23:45 big difference between something like wearing
00:23:48 braces on your teeth
00:23:50 and wearing braces on your teeth,
00:23:52 putting on moisturizing creams and such and
00:23:56 what is already surgery, no, yes, but I think
00:24:00 it is a very arbitrary differentiation,
00:24:03 that is all, which is  the difference between,
00:24:08 for example, having a facelift,
00:24:11 which is surgery, not
00:24:14 to make your skin firmer,
00:24:18 with an extra difference between that or
00:24:22 injections of any filler or
00:24:25 botox, yes, then one thing is surgery,
00:24:28 another thing is not surgery, but the  effect
00:24:32 is the same so there is surgery they are
00:24:35 very minimal there are very large surgeries
00:24:37 so I think that the injections that
00:24:41 you say of botox and so yes they are there yes
00:24:44 that they are at a point where perhaps there would be
00:24:46 more division among people who
00:24:48 consider it
00:24:50 and it may be that they consider it a
00:24:55 procedure that is already more I don't know if it
00:25:00 is more similar although it is more similar
00:25:03 more similar to surgery I don't know in the end
00:25:07 all the  In the world at least all
00:25:10 women do things to themselves
00:25:14 our mothers dye their hair and for
00:25:18 example my grandmother didn't have her hair if
00:25:21 she had all the gray hair and now I think
00:25:24 that younger women are also
00:25:26 going to do more things more things than  his
00:25:28 mothers more things than his grandmothers and little
00:25:32 by little he will become more and more normal
00:25:37 maybe at some point we will become
00:25:39 all the characters in a
00:25:42 virtual reality and it will matter little
00:25:45 if what I would like Pablo is this
00:25:50 is to be able to wear a  filter like these
00:25:53 snap chat instagram filters and not
00:25:56 have to do anything just take my
00:25:58 take my filter in real life take
00:26:01 your ideal character model it
00:26:05 's easier it would be easier like this one
00:26:09 last question soul would you ask  It's something
00:26:13 yes, that is, if I had a lot of money,
00:26:17 I would surely do everything, yes,
00:26:20 honestly, yes, because well, not
00:26:24 everything,
00:26:25 surely I would start with things that
00:26:28 are not permanent, because of everything, you already know
00:26:31 that the more things you do, the more
00:26:33 likely that one of them will work out for you.
00:26:37 yes but I would try things that are not
00:26:42 permanent for example botox is not
00:26:44 permanent
00:26:46 many fillers are not really
00:26:49 permanent well yes I
00:26:53 would like to because I like to try
00:26:56 all those things but I think maybe
00:27:00 after trying I would think about it I don't want to
00:27:04 more because sometimes that happens to me I try
00:27:08 something think and if I want to try it and
00:27:10 then I realize that it's not there it
00:27:14 's not what I wanted okay and you Pablo I
00:27:17 wanted to go out I type surgery I don't think
00:27:21 there is any surgery right now what to
00:27:24 me  help in any way yes I
00:27:27 would like to fix my teeth if
00:27:30 there was some way to do it that would not
00:27:32 be very annoying
00:27:35 the hair so with age I get hair
00:27:38 from where before n  or it would come out no
00:27:41 so if I could do laser hair removal I don't know well
00:27:44 between the eyebrows in
00:27:47 the hair from which my ears grow and
00:27:50 such well maybe it would be something something practical
00:27:52 something comfortable yes and the only thing
00:27:55 I would really change about my body but what  There is
00:27:59 no surgery for this I would say I
00:28:01 have very narrow wrists I have
00:28:04 very narrow arms
00:28:07 but I can't make my arms
00:28:09 thick either I don't think there is any
00:28:11 way and well even if there was
00:28:13 surely I wouldn't do it would be something
00:28:15 very important surgery very invasive
00:28:19 and  I would not do it, not of course, for that
00:28:22 you only have to eat a lot and do a lot of
00:28:25 sports, but the issue is that and I think
00:28:27 not in the wrists, I think that no matter how
00:28:29 much, how fat, and how many muscles
00:28:30 you have, they remain finite if
00:28:34 you drop your  watch
00:28:37 is if I do not know
00:28:40 for my size for the height that I have
00:28:43 and so if I have
00:28:46 quite degraded wrists
00:28:48 well maybe in the future the surgery will
00:28:52 find a solution to that perhaps the
00:28:55 avatar of reality v  irtual now
00:28:57 I can do it however I like exactly I become
00:29:02 a lizard man or whatever
00:29:06 very good soul it has been very very fun to
00:29:09 talk about what we think about
00:29:12 cosmetic surgery in
00:29:14 the end maybe we have
00:29:16 agreed on more things than  those of us who have not
00:29:18 agreed if it is a topic that
00:29:22 we had never talked about then well we
00:29:26 did not know that we had so many meeting points
00:29:30 things in common
00:29:32 very good very good well let's see if the
00:29:37 students like these debates and
00:29:39 in the future we can do  better
00:29:42 come bye
00:29:50 [Music]
00:29:52 ah
00:29:53 [Music]
",3
025,"00:00:00 in my favor
00:00:04 hello very good today we are going to have
00:00:08 a debate again to debate between a and b
00:00:15 and today I am going to be in favor of
00:00:21 marriages not of having a girlfriend and
00:00:27 marrying someone from
00:00:32 another country from another country
00:00:38 adrià and I are Spanish
00:00:42 we are not Spanish
00:00:44 we are Spanish or we are not Catalan
00:00:53 and yes
00:00:55 and I think it is a good idea to
00:01:00 marry someone from another from another
00:01:05 country and another country for example from Brazil
00:01:10 or Australia or Bhutan yes but adrià
00:01:17 that you that you what  Do you think it
00:01:19 depends on me? I see more
00:01:23 problems with this than marrying someone
00:01:25 from another country. I see some problems.
00:01:27 Adrià thinks it's a problem, no, and you
00:01:32 think it's better to marry someone
00:01:35 from Spain, maybe that's how it's done in general.
00:01:39 Well, I don't agree because
00:01:44 marrying someone else from Spain
00:01:48 is very boring. It's boring.
00:02:05 the
00:02:08 differences the differences of cultures
00:02:10 exact the cultural differences are
00:02:15 are very interesting at the beginning it is very
00:02:19 interesting but little little time with
00:02:21 time maybe for six months maybe
00:02:23 for a year maybe maybe for a
00:02:26 one year maybe for a year yes
00:02:29 interesting the cultural differences
00:02:31 are very  interesting
00:02:33 but after a while this is no longer and
00:02:36 then not anymore and if at first
00:02:41 thanks to the cultural differences you
00:02:44 thought we had a
00:02:47 great time because every day is always very
00:02:49 interesting and very fun very accurate
00:02:52 then maybe you didn't realize
00:02:56 Maybe you didn't see that the two of you really do
00:03:01 n't have enough things or points of
00:03:05 how you don't have it because at the beginning it's
00:03:07 easier at the beginning every day is very
00:03:09 interesting because it's from another culture
00:03:12 etc. but after a while
00:03:14 when there's no more this you say  ah when
00:03:16 the day when you already know all the
00:03:18 differences
00:03:20 interesting exactly then you see that it
00:03:23 does not fit for me this can  OK, okay,
00:03:27 seriously, I see it a bit like that,
00:03:31 but of course it depends on where it depends, it
00:03:34 depends on which countries Croft goes to
00:03:38 for me, all Western countries,
00:03:41 for example, are very similar, all of
00:03:47 Europe is very similar, there are almost no
00:03:52 cultural differences, okay.  There are
00:03:54 important ones but for example I am
00:03:56 thinking because I have lived in China I
00:03:59 am thinking of couples I know not
00:04:02 of him a Chinese half and a
00:04:06 European half a Chinese person a person from
00:04:09 Europe exactly and and for me it would be
00:04:12 complicated for me it would be more  Complicated
00:04:14 officer is going easy for me I think it's
00:04:18 true you have to not pay
00:04:21 attention and not only see the
00:04:23 cultural differences
00:04:26 but also know how to speak know how to
00:04:29 communicate with the couple very well
00:04:33 from the beginning c
00:04:37 but
00:04:39 never sarthe with someone from another country
00:04:43 It's very good because later you have
00:04:45 children
00:04:47 and then the children can speak
00:04:51 different languages ​​heh heh they
00:04:55 have two countries, for example Spain  and
00:04:58 south africa not clear and the children can go
00:05:01 here and meet their grandparents and speak in
00:05:06 one language and return to spain and speak in
00:05:11 another language have other other grandparents i
00:05:13 think it is very interesting
00:05:17 totally if it is literally
00:05:20 totally having them and since then
00:05:23 the children
00:05:25 For example, they can go to school in
00:05:29 Spain and then in the summer, not when
00:05:32 it's hot in the summer, go on vacation, not
00:05:35 with a plane,
00:05:38 go to South Africa and see what I don't
00:05:44 totally agree with, but what
00:05:47 scares me what I think with  and it is
00:05:50 that of course fear is that
00:05:53 perhaps you will not reach this point of having children anymore, it
00:05:56 is difficult to reach this
00:05:58 point before Andrés I have children
00:06:01 I know what there are problems you are afraid of,
00:06:04 for example for me another problem
00:06:06 sometimes with couples  different countries is
00:06:09 that when I live in Spain
00:06:12 when I live in Spain in Spanish I
00:06:15 am in a way I have some
00:06:18 customs I have some things that
00:06:21 are different okay com is like now
00:06:23 different like  a different era you have
00:06:25 fun in different ways and from the
00:06:28 east if you live in spain if you live in
00:06:30 china for example jump you can change a
00:06:32 lot you can have different groups of friends
00:06:34 your friends are different
00:06:37 exactly and also when i speak spanish or
00:06:40 when i speak english or when i speak chinese
00:06:42 The personality
00:06:44 the type of person I am changes a
00:06:46 little yes yes I believe I
00:06:49 also believe that and I think about this
00:06:51 imagine that I meet someone here in
00:06:55 china and in
00:06:57 china things are going well but what if then maybe we go
00:06:59 to spain later  you come to spain from china it
00:07:02 can change a lot and your girlfriend don't have
00:07:06 to spend adrià
00:07:09 and not his girlfriend
00:07:12 and then his girlfriend comes to spain he meets
00:07:16 your friends and it is possible for us to say that
00:07:20 yes if i can change a little people
00:07:23 are different in  We change her country of origin and in
00:07:25 other countries a lot and
00:07:29 I think it's true that maybe if your girlfriend
00:07:32 comes to Spain after her life here in
00:07:36 Spain, she may not like it, it's not
00:07:38 possible, she doesn't like life here.  I went because
00:07:41 there is
00:07:43 n't, I don't know, there isn't, his family isn't here and he
00:07:45 gives friends a way to have
00:07:48 fun and have a good time, they die, 30 exactly,
00:07:52 for me there can be these problems, but
00:07:54 if you end up having children, they
00:07:56 are always very handsome and have  Many
00:07:59 times the children are either very
00:08:01 handsome
00:08:02 but that is in my favor
00:08:09 because I think that marrying
00:08:15 someone from another country
00:08:16 is also very good because if my girlfriend
00:08:20 comes to Spain she does not come
00:08:26 to Spain and then I go with my girlfriend  and
00:08:30 if my friends and my family see her, they
00:08:34 think or how good how beautiful the god and
00:08:39 I
00:08:40 can keep you can keep it burns ar
00:08:42 can brag I don't see a bardear as a girlfriend
00:08:46 look look my girlfriend is a foreigner yes yes
00:08:48 yes yes the effect is fine it's a  good
00:08:54 argument he likes it here people
00:08:56 like it we always think that abroad
00:08:59 is better more exact we always think
00:09:01 about the gnome especially europe
00:09:04 europe we always think it is better in
00:09:07 europe a lot of people especially in spain
00:09:08 so always think  We know that in other
00:09:13 countries they are better they are always like that a lot
00:09:16 in most of the people we think this
00:09:19 in other countries is
00:09:22 worth it very well thank you thank you for the
00:09:25 knowledge and see you see you in the
00:09:29 next debate okay done I want I
00:09:32 want to debate debate many things
00:09:35 come in handy  If you have a problem,
00:09:37 come on
00:09:38 if you have an idea
00:09:43 for a debate and you want
00:09:46 us to act as a toilet, there will be no debate on
00:09:48 a subject, write write below in the
00:09:51 comments, okay, come only to the Canary Islands,
00:09:59 although
00:10:04 what are the highest authorities?

228,"00:00:02 [Music]
00:00:05 hello, how are you, I'm Sofia
00:00:09 here with you once again and I'm going to tell you a
00:00:12 true story of how I almost died when I
00:00:16 was 17 years old.
00:00:26 story that
00:00:28 today I am going to share with you
00:00:30 first let's start in the past how
00:00:35 that day began it was a normal
00:00:39 school day like every day I was
00:00:42 leaving school and my friends
00:00:46 invited me to go for a ride in the car
00:00:48 I  I thought it was a fabulous idea
00:00:53 plus my friends were my classmates
00:00:56 so I thought it was a
00:00:59 fabulous idea we had already finished
00:01:02 classes
00:01:03 we were ready to go and I thought
00:01:06 it was a very good idea
00:01:08 and we are driving and I realize that the
00:01:13 The girl who was driving was
00:01:17 speeding at that point I
00:01:20 was already a little scared because I noticed that
00:01:24 something was strange that she was driving
00:01:26 very fast I got worried I got scared and the
00:01:30 first thing I did was put on my seatbelt
00:01:33 safety ron
00:01:34 commercial friends remember it is very
00:01:38 important to always wear your
00:01:40 seatbelt wherever you
00:01:43 go well let's continue I realized
00:01:46 that the girl was going very fast so I
00:01:50 put on my seatbelt
00:01:51 I grabbed on and in my mind I was thinking
00:01:55 that something was wrong  maybe it could happen but
00:01:58 on the other hand I thought it was
00:02:00 completely normal that nothing had
00:02:04 to happen because they were already
00:02:06 used to handling it like this and that maybe
00:02:09 it was me getting ideas
00:02:13 so I really didn't think of anything
00:02:16 I just said everything will be  well
00:02:19 I waited and we continued driving in one of
00:02:23 those a kind of mountain came an
00:02:27 unevenness in the road
00:02:29 what my partner did in that unevenness
00:02:33 was accelerate that caused the car to
00:02:37 go very fast and when it came
00:02:40 to the unevenness
00:02:42 the car will fly
00:02:45 what is it  What about the rest? The truth is, I do
00:02:49 n't remember very well because the
00:02:51 car turned over. The car turned over and
00:02:54 began to spin and the truth is that
00:02:58 I don't remember much.  I only remember a
00:03:01 lot of noise I
00:03:03 remember that everything was gray and I remember
00:03:07 that there was a lot of dust but other than that
00:03:11 I don't remember anything else I knew
00:03:14 exactly where we were, it was not far from my
00:03:16 house and I remember when the
00:03:19 accident happened when I realized what
00:03:23 was happening  and we got out of the car I didn't
00:03:27 know where we were I was
00:03:30 completely lost and it's incredible
00:03:33 how your brain works in an
00:03:37 emergency in an accident in something
00:03:39 where you have to survive for me to
00:03:42 remember
00:03:44 and go back to that time where I had the
00:03:47 accident but I remember once I
00:03:51 got out  I didn't remember anything about the car I didn't
00:03:54 know where I was I didn't know what had
00:03:57 happened and I remember that it was very traumatic
00:04:01 that I only saw the
00:04:03 wrecked car and my friends were also very
00:04:06 disoriented without knowing what had happened
00:04:09 to anyone absolutely
00:04:12 nothing happened to us nothing happened to us that was  very good
00:04:16 I had minor cuts I remember that I
00:04:19 cut myself here I still have the scar or
00:04:22 I don't remember them here I feel
00:04:24 I cut a little very little I cut myself here and
00:04:28 I started to bleed from here
00:04:31 very little very little but when
00:04:35 the paramedics arrived at the scene I
00:04:38 looked like something out of a horror movie
00:04:42 so I remember perfectly that the
00:04:46 paramedics went directly
00:04:49 with me and began to ask me questions
00:04:52 like  how are you who is the
00:04:56 president at this moment what day is it
00:04:59 today what time is it I didn't know anything about that I
00:05:03 was completely lost in the
00:05:06 accident and what had happened
00:05:09 however after a few minutes
00:05:11 you start to breathe you start to calm down
00:05:14 and  you realize that everything is fine
00:05:17 and we all began
00:05:19 to realize that everything had been a
00:05:22 terrible accident the car was a total loss
00:05:25 the car could not be recovered and
00:05:29 it was truly a miracle that we all
00:05:31 got out of there without any injuries
00:05:34 no one had  an injury we were all
00:05:37 perfectly fine just a few
00:05:40 cuts and that was it but for the
00:05:44 magnitude of the accident for what happened
00:05:47 I think it really  We were all
00:05:51 very lucky, so friends, as a

00:00:20 Hi Well, a new
00:00:25 Monkey Island
00:00:27 to Monkey Island game just came out And yes I want to play I
00:00:32 wanted to play because this game brings me a
00:00:36 lot of nostalgia I played  to these games
00:00:39 i have played a couple of monkey
00:00:43 island games when i was little
00:00:45 this is already the sixth it is the number 6 game
00:00:49 of monkey island but it is the third from the
00:00:53 original creator of the game and this game
00:00:57 continues more or less continues with the
00:01:01 story of  the first two games Ok
00:01:04 then
00:01:06 to have a bit of an idea a bit of
00:01:10 context let's open this the scrapbook
00:01:15 here Explain what had already happened the
00:01:19 previous story so we'll know
00:01:22 who is who What happened ok since I was
00:01:26 little I've always wanted to be  a
00:01:28 great pirate
00:01:30 So it
00:01:32 's the name of the character it's the
00:01:35 protagonist no
00:01:38 That's me guybrachs trip1 ok
00:01:43 so in the past to be a pirate you
00:01:46 had to pass three tests that
00:01:48 proved  n your worth you your courage your
00:01:51 bravery not
00:01:53 So what tests were the search for
00:01:58 treasures is important for every pirate
00:02:01 you had to show that you knew how to
00:02:03 find a treasure to
00:02:06 master sword fighting required more
00:02:09 cunning than skill you also had to
00:02:11 pass the sword fighting test  and
00:02:15 the proof of the robbery I had to sneak into
00:02:18 the governor's mansion the
00:02:20 security was extreme I had to
00:02:23 prove that I could steal because of
00:02:25 course pirates steal it's not their job very
00:02:30 well and yes Tell me more about this woman
00:02:33 this is when she met elain's love
00:02:36 my life then was the governor his
00:02:39 love his love was the governor of The
00:02:43 Island she was the boss of The Island ok
00:02:47 everything took an unexpected turn while
00:02:49 doing the three tests
00:02:52 What happened Ellen was kidnapped and taken
00:02:55 to Monkey Island at the hands of the infamous
00:02:57 lechak ghost pirate  The
00:03:00 ghost pirate is this not him chach I thought I
00:03:03 was in love with him ok he
00:03:06 assembled a crew Carla otis and
00:03:10 mithuk accompanied me on my journey
00:03:12 ha  sta Monkey Island to save eleine
00:03:16 ok yes these three very well What else my
00:03:20 first boat was the sea monkey I
00:03:23 bought it in the second-hand boats of
00:03:25 Stand with a credit that falsifies ok he
00:03:28 bought a boat and with his crew his
00:03:31 three people his  three companions went to
00:03:35 the island of lechak to Monkey Island to
00:03:38 rescue him no
00:03:42 Monkey Island was a volcanic
00:03:44 and smoking mystery volcano not covered in jungle
00:03:48 did not appear that the maps did not appear
00:03:52 on the island there was a statue of a
00:03:55 giant monkey head that hid
00:03:57 underground catacombs hid like a
00:04:01 good like a cemetery not a place
00:04:03 where there are people buried under the underground
00:04:06 ground okay we had to make a
00:04:10 potion to find Monkey Island
00:04:12 substitute some ingredients I use other
00:04:15 ingredients but we got there anyway
00:04:18 okay this I don't know if I want you to tell me
00:04:21 more about  this
00:04:23 The ghost ship of lechaq was anchored in
00:04:26 a lava lake hidden beneath the
00:04:28 surface of the island the ship was in
00:04:31 a lake on the  It would be a bank, a ghost ship,
00:04:35 not because a wooden ship
00:04:39 cannot be in a lake of lava, I
00:04:42 knew a shipwrecked German Tuth, the
00:04:46 inhabitants and he argued a lot about the
00:04:48 letter,
00:04:51 we returned to the melee island for the
00:04:53 amazing outcome of my first and Great
00:04:55 Adventure ok I made it to the church
00:04:59 Just in time to stop the wedding to
00:05:02 stop chat from marrying elein
00:05:05 but elain are cute ok it turns
00:05:09 out Lane already had it all under
00:05:11 control how does he do it then
00:05:15 Guy brass no no he didn't help
00:05:19 her basically  it exploded
00:05:23 by then he had figured out that
00:05:25 ghosts like lechak are vulnerable to
00:05:28 root beer he attacked him with beer
00:05:31 ok This was the start of something magical
00:05:36 I think this was the first
00:05:37 game I think
00:05:39 so those These are from when I went
00:05:42 treasure hunting  from Big Book ok
00:05:44 later he went to look for a treasure he
00:05:47 met his friend Wally
00:05:51 the control to The voodoo Sorceress of the
00:05:53 international house
00:05:56 treasure map
00:05:58 ok again the chat is over
00:06:01 and  They faced the echack and they used magic
00:06:06 the link turned into a statue
00:06:10 they buried him very well I knew Murray
00:06:14 a skull a talking skull This
00:06:16 I remember about the skull
00:06:20 and then
00:06:21 Lane and I
00:06:23 eleinybras got married when it was all over
00:06:26 ok And this was a great day  Although to
00:06:31 perched bull We should not have
00:06:32 commissioned the catering to the scamcar ok
00:06:36 Well I think we more or less
00:06:39 know the story
00:06:42 ok This was the time Chuck
00:06:44 allied himself with an Australian
00:06:46 billionaire and tried to use a Mystical talisman
00:06:49 to make his girlfriend look good  well it seems
00:06:52 that more or less the same thing is happening, let's
00:06:56 not see if there is any other character that
00:06:59 we want to meet Morgan leflame bring me
00:07:02 if it's not worth it this is a character who
00:07:05 betrayed him
00:07:08 and well with this he managed to
00:07:11 defeat the hechak again and that's it Okay then
00:07:14 come on let's play new game
00:07:18 in casual mode or hard mode more
00:07:22 puzzles and more difficult yes I think this
00:07:25 is the serious mode the real
00:07:28 mode come to hard mode

00:19:51 look at the anchor
00:19:54 piece of anchor
00:19:57 that shows  how little you understand about
00:19:59 anchors This is not a very good example
00:20:01 you would know If you had read
00:20:03 as much about anchors as I did you knew that
00:20:06 anchors were not designed to hold
00:20:08 ships still
00:20:10 they were used  in combat they were shot with
00:20:12 you are making this up with cannons like
00:20:14 Hook to embroider they
00:20:16 began to make them bigger because that way they
00:20:18 caused more damage
00:20:20 until people realized that what
00:20:22 happened when you failed and they went to the
00:20:24 bottom of the sea
00:20:25 that they  she's sleeping now I think I'm going to
00:20:27 skip the vocabulary the dialogue this

00:20:34 Hermione and Harry Potter at the beginning
00:20:37 in the first book
00:20:40 I can't skip it everything is fine That's
00:20:44 it if she was also making it up I mean she
00:20:46 was saying that the  anchors began
00:20:48 as harpoons if you missed something
00:20:51 press comma to see the
00:20:53 previous sentences Ah very well

00:26:45 I don't see them
00:26:48 here there is nothing not to
00:26:51 rehearse sword fighting Ah sword fighting
00:26:54 is something mythical  of this game
00:26:56 because the fight with the sword is a fight of
00:27:00 speech, it is a fight of dialogue, not with
00:27:02 real swords, at least let's see in
00:27:05 the first game,
00:27:08 it doesn't seem that they are really fighting
00:27:10 with the scurvy as if they
00:27:13 were swords.
00:27:15 Well, that's good.  It's been fun
00:27:18 Okay, well, nothing. What else do I have here to
00:27:21 do?
00:27:24 I have to eat the corputifarra with
00:27:27 ketchup,
00:27:29 but also feed the leg.
00:27:32 Ah, well, I have to add sauce. I don't have
00:27:35 to add sauce and eat.  I can
00:27:37 put sauce on it and that's it and then I have to
00:27:40 look for my parents Okay then
00:27:44 Ketchup Ketchup Ketchup I'll go back to
00:27:47 the area from before to see if I can find

00:28:08 has glasses that are thicker than the finger
00:28:10 of fat that he has on the floor, I didn't want him,
00:28:12 I didn't want to tell him, this is going to make
00:28:14 the man angry.

00:10:48 ] finally it is convenient for you foreseen
00:10:51 the love of a mother for
00:10:53 video games does not end ok this story was
00:10:55 written by a user of the page and in
00:10:58 valentina it is not a true story it is
00:11:01 complex called  number 5 is not
00:11:03 I had a good time for a while my
00:11:05 brother and I played it for a
00:11:07 whole month but he
00:11:08 didn't get bored anyway
00:11:09 I always wanted my parents to
00:11:11 play video games so I thought
00:11:13 animal crossing would be the right game
00:11:15 for them  they will play with
00:11:17 me so i showed it to my mom i
00:11:20 let her do her house and as soon as i
00:11:23 realized she was already very hooked
00:11:24 on the game
00:11:26 she had polio and now she suffered from
00:11:29 multiple sclerosis most of the
00:11:32 time  Po lived at home,
00:11:34 except when they went out, she beat the
00:11:35 church in a wheelchair and she had a
00:11:37 great time on the bus. She
00:11:39 felt very happy. She didn't play so much
00:11:42 that it even became an obsession for her,
00:11:44 even my family and I.  we made fun
00:11:46 of her well she developed and she
00:11:48 got her box in the game what's more she
00:11:51 collected all the fossils every time she
00:11:54 saw her play she thought that surely she
00:11:56 had already bored her but she didn't play it much
00:11:59 even long after my
00:12:01 brother and I didn't even play it anymore
00:12:03 However her condition progressed
00:12:07 and in the end she eventually stopped playing
00:12:09 for about a year she
00:12:12 passed away completely bad life to the mic
00:12:15 without having played it for a
00:12:17 year and a half probably but today
00:12:20 I decided to play it again and visit my
00:12:23 little village to see  how there is
00:12:25 a message a written message from the mother
00:12:27 or to those who have been dating wonder but
00:12:29 no where my mom and I had
00:12:31 been so I went to see my email your
00:12:34 name is  ba full of gifts
00:12:38 from the letter said it's pretty much the
00:12:40 same
00:12:41 [Music]
00:12:49 this reminds me i stopped playing she
00:12:52 kept playing to send me gifts
00:12:55 now i think about how i made fun of her for
00:12:57 being so hooked i feel like a
00:12:59 fool you know she spent all her time
00:13:02 to  give me more
00:13:04 gifts anyway just share this story because of
00:13:07 how much it affected me show
00:13:09 love to your parents as many times as
00:13:11 possible you who still can sometimes
00:13:14 do unbelievably fabulous things it's
00:13:17 all because of this so yes it hits you
00:13:21 that a person from the  today's challenge we managed to
00:13:24 get to the end without crying
00:13:27 not that when a person who died
00:13:29 later leaves a message or does something we
00:13:33 realize that he did something for us well
00:13:37 yes it is very very emotional and
00:13:40 emotional it excites a lot
00:13:42 and well I was thinking that  I was
00:13:45 thinking of doing more, making other videos
00:13:47 because I thought that maybe with a
00:13:50 video I wasn't going to cry, but be careful,
00:13:53 but well, with this, with this, I think it
00:13:56 's enough.  You don't need any more, it has already
00:13:58 managed to make me cry
00:14:02 and you who
00:14:04 have cried watching this video
00:14:07 or not I am a crybaby and
00:14:11 since I was little I
00:14:12 immediately cried but but

049,"00:00:00 Today I am going to explain what is the best
00:00:04 way to learn Spanish what is the
00:00:08 best way the ideal way to learn
00:00:11 Spanish Spanish or any language and I
00:00:16 am going to explain how you can use these
00:00:20 videos how to watch these videos to
00:00:23 improve your level of Spanish
00:00:28 and some  things some things that I am going to
00:00:33 say surely many people many
00:00:37 people will not agree they will not think the
00:00:40 same
00:00:42 [Music]
00:00:47 good well
00:00:49 yes the way to learn to improve
00:00:55 is by watching videos of course of course and
00:01:02 when you watch the videos you have to
00:01:05 try to understand try to understand
00:01:09 see what I am saying that I say what
00:01:14 is the meaning of what I say
00:01:18 but it is not necessary it is not necessary to
00:01:22 understand each word all the words
00:01:27 it is not necessary to understand them above all
00:01:32 try to have fun try to understand what
00:01:37 I am saying and fun to watch videos that
00:01:42 you like that  you like them a lot that you have
00:01:45 fun and watch watch many videos
00:01:49 watch a long time a long time of
00:01:53 videos
00:01:55 now that's right when you watch u  n video you have
00:01:59 to pay attention you have to be
00:02:02 attentive to watch it carefully I
00:02:06 don't recommend I think it's not a good idea
00:02:09 to listen to the videos to listen to it in the
00:02:14 background while you cook
00:02:19 while you are cooking or
00:02:22 doing other things to listen to the videos to
00:02:25 listen to them in the background I think I think not  It doesn't
00:02:30 help much, it's better, it's better to pay
00:02:35 attention, concentrate, yes, but when you
00:02:40 hear a word, a new word, a
00:02:45 word you didn't know before, it's not necessary, you do
00:02:49 n't have to repeat the repeat
00:02:53 the word, or booby booby booby booger
00:02:58 elephant elephant elephant elephant
00:03:01 elephant month by month  a month a month a month a
00:03:04 no no no it is not necessary to do that
00:03:08 because the same word the word again
00:03:12 you will hear it again in the future
00:03:16 you will hear the same word
00:03:19 and my videos the same video if you
00:03:24 want to watch it several times watch it twice
00:03:29 times three times the same video no if you
00:03:34 want to see it several times you
00:03:37 can also do it no problem
00:03:40 okay okay okay okay
00:03:44 always whenever  If you are
00:03:48 having fun if you are getting bored it is
00:03:53 better not to do it no no if you watch a
00:03:57 video you watch it again you watch it
00:04:01 twice no and the second time you watch it you
00:04:05 understand more and you like it you like to watch
00:04:09 the videos twice because
00:04:12 you understand them more well  It's okay, no
00:04:16 problem, but if you watch a video many
00:04:21 times and you get bored,
00:04:25 you get bored, it's better to watch other
00:04:29 videos, go see other videos that you
00:04:33 like that are more fun, other
00:04:37 videos that you pay
00:04:41 attention to,
00:04:43 and if you really watch a lot of videos,
00:04:47 watch  hours hours and hours and hours and
00:04:51 hours of videos in the end you will finish
00:04:53 all my videos I will watch jce all all
00:04:58 the videos that I have in the
00:05:02 future I would like to have many videos
00:05:06 have infinite videos so that
00:05:10 you can watch videos watch
00:05:15 videos and continue  continue watching videos
00:05:19 but for now you can listen to
00:05:24 podcasts or listen to the radio in Spanish or
00:05:29 watch television in Spanish too and so
00:05:33 you can continue improving your  level and
00:05:37 when your level is quite good
00:05:41 you can watch television series,
00:05:44 especially I recommend you watch series
00:05:48 with families, series with students,
00:05:53 series from the school at home,
00:05:58 day-to-day things, vocabulary, not with
00:06:03 day-to-day language that we use every
00:06:06 day and  it is vocabulary it is very
00:06:10 useful language very useful for you
00:06:13 to learn words to improve
00:06:16 your vocabulary you can also read
00:06:20 reading it helps a lot to improve your
00:06:24 vocabulary but I do not recommend reading
00:06:28 at the beginning I do not recommend reading before you
00:06:33 have heard a lot I think it
00:06:37 is better to listen listen  a lot a lot and
00:06:42 then start reading first first
00:06:47 listen listen a lot and when the
00:06:52 sound of Spanish
00:06:56 seems natural to you then it's a good
00:07:00 time to read
00:07:03 and read a lot I think I think it's better at
00:07:08 first to listen to listen a lot
00:07:12 to be able to talk be able to talk about
00:07:17 clear way similar to the natives
00:07:20 similar to me to the other Spaniards or to
00:07:24 the  Other Hispanic Americans, not like that, you will
00:07:28 speak very clearly and we will
00:07:32 understand you well and to speak and to
00:07:36 write I think it is the same
00:07:40 better first listen a
00:07:45 lot and later on in the
00:07:49 future you will be able to practice speaking
00:07:51 you can speak and write but I think  I think
00:07:57 it's not a good idea to talk a lot or
00:08:01 write a lot before listening
00:08:05 to listen a lot and then talk and
00:08:10 then write I think this is
00:08:15 the best way to have a
00:08:17 very good
00:08:19 pronunciation a very clear pronunciation and to
00:08:23 also have a very good grammar  Well
00:08:28 this is my idea and if you have any
00:08:32 questions if you have any
00:08:35 questions you can write below in the
00:08:39 comments if you have any questions or
00:08:42 if you want to tell me no it's not
00:08:45 true that I'm not right you want to
00:08:48 call me stupid pablo stupid or  pablo or fool
00:08:52 you don't know anything write it down in
00:08:56 the comments
00:08:57 okay come bye

00:01:06 tall or short person is he handsome well
00:01:12 not ugly and you have to guess who he is you have
00:01:16 to guess if he is batman or if he is
00:01:20 donald trump or if he is  queen isabel
00:01:24 you have to guess the character
00:01:26 so yes with the 8
00:01:30 current dreaming teachers it's paris and i'm going to
00:01:34 explain a bit the rules
00:01:36 normally soul like what are the
00:01:39 rules of this game well the rules are
00:01:43 what  e can be
00:01:46 asked to 20 questions
00:01:48 but they have to be yes or no questions
00:01:52 no yes then you can't ask
00:01:56 how old he is you never have to
00:02:00 ask is he over 30 so that
00:02:04 the other person can answer you yes
00:02:07 or no so I know how  how
00:02:12 we are going to play is that we are not going to have
00:02:16 a limit of questions it is not going to be there
00:02:18 are not going to be 20 questions because we want
00:02:22 one person to always win not when
00:02:26 two people play each person
00:02:28 will think of a character and we will see
00:02:32 which of the  two people ask more
00:02:36 questions and the person who asks fewer
00:02:39 questions is going to win the game is going to
00:02:43 win the game so another rule is
00:02:47 that asking, that is, trying to guess the
00:02:51 name of the weight, also counts as a
00:02:55 question, yes then yes I already have
00:02:59 15 questions and I ask is it superman and you
00:03:04 tell me yes well there are 16 16 questions okay
00:03:10 because so if I have to ask mass
00:03:13 no it's not superman it's batman well each
00:03:16 one will count as a question okay
00:03:19 I understand and  Another rule is that if a
00:03:23 person thinks of a character that the
00:03:26 other person does not know, then we are
00:03:29 going to play that character again, that person
00:03:33 has to think of a different character and they
00:03:36 have to start over that
00:03:39 half of the game, not that character if they
00:03:42 have  felt very good and then the
00:03:45 winner of each round will advance to the
00:03:48 next round and today we have to
00:03:52 choose we have to choose
00:03:55 who is going to play who is going to play against
00:03:57 whom I have here soul a box with a
00:04:01 piece of paper for each teacher of dream in

00:00:23 answers this is the first
00:00:27 intermediate level video that I do of questions and
00:00:30 answers
00:00:33 and let's start  I'll start at the
00:00:36 beginning and I'll do the ones that give me time,
00:00:39 which I'll do a few, I don't know, I don't know if
00:00:43 all of them, but I'll do the ones that I can, the ones that
00:00:45 give me time
00:00:55 .  what
00:00:58 my favorite fictional character I
00:01:02 like interesting
00:01:07 characters characters
00:01:09 that have a very
00:01:12 different personality a personality very different
00:01:16 from normal in general characters that
00:01:20 are not
00:01:22 afraid that are not afraid
00:01:25 a character that I like I like but
00:01:29 it is not my  My favorite is Barney Stinson, I
00:01:34 like Barney Stinson from How I Met
00:01:36 Your Mother, how my way met your
00:01:39 mother, which in Spanish is How I Met
00:01:42 Your Mother, I like.  barney because
00:01:45 well he's very funny all his
00:01:49 crazy things he does but the
00:01:53 problem with barney is that he is not a good
00:01:56 person he is not a person who
00:02:00 thinks about the good of other
00:02:03 people he is not a good person but
00:02:07 there is a character  What I like the most I don't know I do
00:02:11 n't know if it's my favorite but it's a
00:02:13 character that I like and it's hank moody
00:02:17 hank moody from californication I don't know if
00:02:21 you've seen the series the
00:02:23 television series californication
00:02:26 but the main character the main
00:02:29 character is called hank moody hank
00:02:32 moody is the actor is the man from
00:02:36 the x-file the x-files x-file is
00:02:41 the same actor no
00:02:43 and in this in this series in
00:02:46 californication the man the
00:02:50 protagonist
00:02:51 is a person who says things very
00:02:54 directly he is very honest and
00:03:00 says what he thinks  If there is something that he
00:03:02 thinks about it, he says it right away and it is something
00:03:06 that fascinates me that I
00:03:09 would like to be able to do that a little bit and I think that if
00:03:13 I were a little more like Hank Moody my
00:03:16 life would be more fun
00:03:19 ad  Also, Hank Moody is a person who flirts a
00:03:21 lot. I don't know many women and he
00:03:25 flirts right away.
00:03:28 That's something that's good, I do
00:03:31 n't want it right now. I now have a girlfriend, but it
00:03:35 makes me think that if
00:03:38 it really is, be direct and say
00:03:42 things very directly it may
00:03:45 attract attract people of the other sex
00:03:49 or the same sex also friends and
00:03:52 people who find you funny and
00:03:56 who want to be friends
00:03:58 the real person the real life version of hank
00:04:02 moody is russell brand i
00:04:06 don't know if  do you know russell brand he is an
00:04:09 english humorist that i love i
00:04:13 love his personality because he also
00:04:16 says what he thinks but he doesn't mean to
00:04:19 hurt he doesn't mean to hurt
00:04:21 people but he's a personality that
00:04:24 fascinates me and he does a good job
00:04:29 tell me about you and your sister  The two of
00:04:34 you fight you go a lot what games what
00:04:36 games did you play ha ha ha ha
00:04:39 I also have a brother six years older than
00:04:44 I loved since I was born and I'm
00:04:47 curious about other fa  milias that
00:04:50 in which there is also a brother and a
00:04:52 sister well
00:04:54 yes as well I am also a
00:04:57 good brother we are an older brother of
00:05:00 a little sister
00:05:02 wen is the younger sister but I am the
00:05:04 older brother
00:05:06 and if when I and my sister were
00:05:10 little
00:05:12 we  we fought we fought a lot and
00:05:16 just yesterday I recorded a video about me
00:05:21 and my sister it's a private video it's a
00:05:24 video of the daily videos intermediate
00:05:28 that you have to sign up you have to
00:05:30 pay if you want to see it but I talk a
00:05:32 little more about my relationship with my
00:05:35 sister and yes when I was little when I
00:05:37 was less than 12 years old we didn't get
00:05:40 along very well but later when
00:05:44 we got older we started to
00:05:47 get along better and now we get
00:05:50 along we get along well and from time to time we
00:05:52 send each other a message and maybe tim v says
00:05:56 First of all, thanks for all your videos
00:05:58 whenever there is one whenever there is a
00:06:00 new video I watch it. My questions are,
00:06:04 do you miss Spain or Europe more and
00:06:08 you plan to return to Spain,
00:06:11 well,  The easiest question is, I plan to
00:06:15 return to Spain, yes,
00:06:17 surely at some point in my life I will
00:06:20 return and live for another year or several years
00:06:23 in Spain. What things do you miss most
00:06:29 about Spain or Europe? I guess what
00:06:34 I miss the most, well  of course the
00:06:37 friends the friends I had in
00:06:40 Barcelona
00:06:42 and if apart from that I don't miss
00:06:45 many things I do miss
00:06:50 the food a little bit maybe here in Thailand
00:06:53 they don't have many types of cheese I
00:06:56 like cheese I like it  I eat cheese I
00:06:59 like to eat hummus too for example and
00:07:02 here I don't find it much it's hard to
00:07:04 find they don't have many different types of
00:07:07 cheese
00:07:09 at the supermarket I usually go to
00:07:11 in the supermarket
00:07:14 I usually go to there is never any hummus
00:07:17 they don't have hummus no no  they
00:07:20 also sell it a bit the variety of places
00:07:24 that can be visited in barcelona
00:07:27 you can go to the sea you can go to the mountains
00:07:30 and here in thailand the sea is fine the
00:07:34 sea is very beautiful but there is really
00:07:37 nothing  There are no mountains, there are no big mountains
00:07:40 that you can go, you can go on excursions,
00:07:43 you can ski, and I miss those things
00:07:48 a little, but well, not
00:07:50 much. I'm quite used to
00:07:54 living in other countries. I've lived in
00:07:56 Finland, in the USA, in Japan, and here in
00:08:01 thailand i have been before i am
00:08:03 quite used to
00:08:05 football tell me
00:08:08 what are for you the biggest challenges or
00:08:12 difficulties of living in
00:08:15 thailand and how has it overcome those
00:08:18 difficulties for me my main
00:08:23 problems living here not living in
00:08:26 thailand but living in bangkok
00:08:29 the dirt that many  sometimes the streets
00:08:34 the ground is dirty and there are rats there are
00:08:37 cockroaches and also in the bank that
00:08:41 there are many canals canals with water with
00:08:43 very dirty water that causes a plague there
00:08:46 are also many cars there are many cars a
00:08:48 lot of pollution and the air is
00:08:51 quite dirty
00:08:53 and good for those  problems you can use
00:08:57 a mask use a mask try to
00:09:00 find the areas where there are fewer
00:09:03 fewer channels with agu  to dirty or there are fewer
00:09:07 cars for example when I go for a run
00:09:10 when I go to exercise in the park to
00:09:13 run I go in the morning I get up
00:09:16 early in the morning because in the
00:09:19 morning there is less pollution the air
00:09:21 is cleaner so it is better for
00:09:24 the body to run  when there is less
00:09:27 pollution and in the morning, well, there
00:09:29 is less, it is better, it is healthier, it is healthier to
00:09:33 run in the morning and for that reason, well, that
00:09:36 is one
00:09:38 way I have dealt with this problem.
00:09:43 Another problem in Thailand is
00:09:46 spicy food, very spicy food for  At
00:09:49 first it was a problem because I
00:09:53 asked for something several times, I started to eat
00:09:56 something and I couldn't finish it, it was
00:09:59 too spicy, I couldn't finish
00:10:01 eating it and what I've done to
00:10:05 prevent this from happening to me is to eat spicy
00:10:07 eat more spicy eat things  spicy
00:10:11 but little by little little by little more and more
00:10:15 spicy to get used to it so that
00:10:18 my body my mouth gets used
00:10:20 little by little to what is spicy I always try to
00:10:24 eat something  or eat something spicy jordan
00:10:28 wonders what you do to take care of yourself it's obvious
00:10:31 that you work almost all day and
00:10:34 that's why I was interested I'm very interested in
00:10:38 your practices to feel good
00:10:41 okay he says it's obvious that I work almost
00:10:45 all day I don't know what work I'm trying to do
00:10:47 work eight hours work only
00:10:50 eight hours a day and work five days
00:10:53 a week to have time to have
00:10:56 time to relax because it
00:10:59 also helps me to
00:11:02 concentrate when I'm working and
00:11:05 good to also have time to
00:11:07 spend with my girlfriend and to  do
00:11:10 other things to read and have time to
00:11:12 do other things
00:11:15 so what do I do to take care of myself well it's one
00:11:18 thing to have time to have
00:11:21 quite strict work hours someday
00:11:25 sometime I work an hour more while
00:11:28 I wait at home for my girlfriend to come maybe I'll
00:11:31 work a little more  And sometime, if it's
00:11:35 something I really have to do, maybe on
00:11:38 a Saturday or Sunday, a few hours, two or
00:11:41 three hours, maybe I work, but the
00:11:43 norm  Actually, I don't normally try to
00:11:46 work only eight hours and five
00:11:49 days a week, so that's one
00:11:52 thing,
00:11:54 another thing is to exercise, do
00:11:57 sports or exercise, and now lately
00:12:01 what I do is I get up I get up in
00:12:05 the morning
00:12:06 for me it's not easy it's not easy
00:12:09 getting up in the morning especially
00:12:12 when I'm alone if I live alone and
00:12:15 I'm alone it
00:12:16 's very easy to say oh it's that
00:12:20 in bed it's very good I don't want to
00:12:23 go jogging but now I live with my girlfriend
00:12:28 so if we are two people it's  It's
00:12:31 easier I know I know we have to go
00:12:35 running and I don't want I don't want
00:12:38 my girlfriend to think that I'm lazy
00:12:42 that I'm lazy so it's easy for me
00:12:46 to say come on come on let's run
00:12:49 and my girlfriend
00:12:51 wait wait me and me  no no no come on
00:12:54 come on we're going to run so what we
00:12:58 do is alternate alternate one
00:13:02 day running and one day
00:13:05 exercising exercising here in the room and
00:13:09 again the next day running and the
00:13:12 next day exercising  or and so we
00:13:16 alternate and well apart from that well
00:13:19 try to eat a lot of vegetables and fruit
00:13:21 have a healthy diet and that's it a little more I
00:13:27 count
00:13:28 ham am from 0 98 says how long it takes
00:13:34 how long it takes you to create a video
00:13:37 including planning recording processing
00:13:40 etc.
00:13:42 is different depending  in the difficulty levels, well
00:13:45 ,
00:13:48 if it's different depending on the
00:13:51 difficulty levels and it's different
00:13:54 depending on the type of video, then
00:13:58 there are videos that I don't have to plan,
00:14:01 the only thing I have to
00:14:04 plan is to think about the subject, to think about the
00:14:08 story, for example, yes  It's a video from
00:14:11 my past from when I was little or from a
00:14:14 long time ago I already know the story
00:14:17 I already know the story so I don't have
00:14:20 to write I don't have to write anything
00:14:22 for the video I just think about the subject and that
00:14:25 's it I go and record it
00:14:28 and stop  record a video because I don't know if the
00:14:32 video lasts 10 minutes because it took more or
00:14:36 less 10 minutes maybe 15 minutes but
00:14:39 it didn't take much longer it didn't take long for
00:14:42 me to record a
00:14:42 video  abar is quite fast
00:14:45 and then processing
00:14:48 processing also depends on the
00:14:51 video ah well wait it has not been counted
00:14:54 to plan to write the video
00:14:57 if it is a video that has a lot of
00:14:59 information or a video that I have to
00:15:01 investigate
00:15:03 I have to look for information on
00:15:05 wikipedia or others
00:15:07 places sometimes it took an hour an hour or two
00:15:10 hours just to investigate it for
00:15:13 example the history videos I
00:15:17 have no idea of ​​history and to be able to
00:15:19 explain the history well I have to
00:15:22 investigate I have to read a lot and many
00:15:25 times it takes me 2 hours  maybe
00:15:29 and to process process is to edit
00:15:32 edit the video cut it put images
00:15:35 put the camera the top camera and the
00:15:40 front camera put them together for the
00:15:43 intermediate videos and that also depends a
00:15:47 lot for videos like this videos
00:15:51 well this video is going to take time
00:15:53 I was going to  It will take some time because
00:15:55 I have to put the images I have to
00:15:57 put the comments of the people,
00:16:00 surely it will take me a while  hour not an
00:16:04 hour an hour and an hour maybe for this
00:16:07 video about an hour or so for
00:16:10 videos that have a lot of images a lot of
00:16:13 photos and have a lot of images that I have
00:16:16 to search for it can take two hours it
00:16:20 can take two hours to
00:16:22 edit a  video
00:16:25 but for intermediate level
00:16:28 videos videos in which I only speak like
00:16:32 the videos in a park that he recorded in
00:16:35 the park those videos really take
00:16:38 five or ten minutes at most 10
00:16:42 minutes to edit each video so
00:16:45 well you see depending on the video
00:16:47 between 10  minutes and 2 hours it changes a
00:16:51 lot depending on the video
00:16:53 cristian howard asks what your
00:16:57 favorite book is you read a lot
00:17:00 ok good first i read a lot yes yes i
00:17:05 read a lot i read a lot i read about
00:17:08 linguistics about more than
00:17:11 linguistics about languages ​​about how
00:17:14 we learn languages ​​but i also read
00:17:17 novels  or non-fiction books but I read
00:17:23 normally I almost always read in the
00:17:26 language I am learning for example
00:17:30 now I read a lot in Japanese  Because I
00:17:34 speak Japanese I already speak Japanese very well
00:17:37 but in books in
00:17:40 novels there are many very
00:17:43 different words there are many words that are
00:17:45 only used in books so
00:17:48 in order to improve well I read in
00:17:51 Japanese and I read a lot or I read almost every
00:17:54 day  I read I read something
00:17:57 and my favorite book this is very difficult
00:18:01 my favorite book or my
00:18:03 favorite character or my favorite movie
00:18:07 people have a favorite movie favorite book
00:18:10 I have read many books in my
00:18:13 life no I don't know which one is my favorite or if
00:18:16 I have a favorite or  I do
00:18:19 n't know right now I remember some books
00:18:22 that I really liked are the books
00:18:25 by José Saramago by a writer
00:18:29 named Saramago and Saramago what he does is
00:18:33 take people take some characters in a
00:18:37 real world in a realistic world just
00:18:40 like ours but the  puts an
00:18:42 impossible situation in an unreal situation
00:18:46 but there is only one thing that is
00:18:49 impossible that is weird only one thing
00:18:53 happens a weird thing and then he leaves us he
00:18:57 leaves them and they come  I've done this, this is
00:19:01 weird and now you have
00:19:04 to manage to find the
00:19:07 solution to see what happens in this
00:19:09 situation,
00:19:11 for example, some books by Saramago
00:19:14 are an essay on blindness and an essay
00:19:18 on lucidity, they are books that I
00:19:22 liked  quite and well I
00:19:25 recommend it to you they are quite interesting
00:19:27 kayla in cold question well thank you for
00:19:31 taking the time to teach us your beautiful
00:19:34 language I am still learning hahaha
00:19:37 my question is where are the places I
00:19:40 mean what places have you traveled and where
00:19:43 do you want to travel I have traveled I have traveled to
00:19:45 I have traveled a lot in Asia
00:19:48 and Europe but I have not
00:19:51 been to Africa or Central
00:19:55 America South America much yet. I have been to Mexico but I
00:19:57 have not been to other Latin American countries
00:20:00 so I would really like to
00:20:02 go to Latin America, especially to
00:20:05 Patagonia or the  to the andes and i
00:20:09 would also like to go to india go
00:20:12 to india i have not been to india yet and i
00:20:15 think it must be a very
00:20:17 interesting
00:20:18 but ask about all the different
00:20:20 accents in the Hispanic world is there any
00:20:26 accent in particular that you like or that
00:20:28 you find interesting apart from yours
00:20:31 that is not yours if mine does not
00:20:34 seem interesting to me the old one seems
00:20:36 normal to me no but I like it a lot  the accent
00:20:39 of the canary islands the accent of the people of the
00:20:43 canary islands speak with a very sweet accent
00:20:46 very very interesting and then the accent
00:20:51 of argentina the accent of argentina
00:20:53 i also like i like it a
00:20:55 lot despite the fact that argentinian people in
00:20:59 spain are famous for  be read before
00:21:03 perhaps being a little liars or
00:21:07 wanting to convince yourself to
00:21:11 do something you don't want to do
00:21:14 and well they have a bit of a reputation for that
00:21:16 but
00:21:18 but well of course it's not true for
00:21:21 most people and the accent bothers me
00:21:25 I like it I like it a lot

00:24:12 bad stories that they have had bad experiences
00:24:14 but I was not working in Japan I
00:24:18 was not in a company I was going to
00:24:21 university and I really liked the
00:24:25 experience of living in Japan of having
00:24:28 friends Japanese friends  You are mostly
00:24:31 Japanese but also some
00:24:33 foreign friends and from visiting the country to
00:24:36 see nature and well I had many
00:24:40 friends when I lived in Japan when I
00:24:42 lived in Kyoto I had more friends
00:24:45 than I have now here in Bangkok
00:24:48 and well in general the experience is  The
00:24:51 best I've ever had in Japan I also
00:24:54 lived in a house in a shared house
00:24:57 with five other people. There were six of us and it
00:25:00 was a lot of fun.

078,"00:00:00 Today I am going to continue explaining the conquest
00:00:06 of America, the rest of the trips that
00:00:11 Colom made to America, and the expansion of
00:00:15 the Spanish empire, how the Spanish empire
00:00:19 spread not only throughout America, but
00:00:23 also to other parts of the world.
00:00:29 [Music]
00:00:31 Ah,
00:00:33 hello,
00:00:35 how are you?  I said in the previous video
00:00:39 Colom arrived in the Americas in 1492 he
00:00:48 arrived in the Americas he returned and the following year
00:00:52 he went again he made another trip to
00:00:55 the Americas yes but this time with many
00:00:59 ships they had ships
00:01:02 ships ships many many ships
00:01:07 and made several trips made a few  how many
00:01:10 voyages and each time each voyage he spent a few
00:01:14 years he spent 23 years in the americas like this
00:01:19 and at that time columbus not colon
00:01:24 christopher columbus
00:01:27 at that time he already thought that maybe the
00:01:32 americas were a separate continent they
00:01:35 were not asia no because at that time at
00:01:39 that time  Colom called them he
00:01:43 called it las indias he called what he
00:01:46 had found las indias and las indias
00:01:48 was the name at that time of asia
00:01:52 and colony he thought maybe this this not  it's
00:01:59 not the indies maybe it's another continent and
00:02:03 he wrote it but then he changed his mind
00:02:07 later he said no no no no yes it is yes
00:02:10 it's the indies
00:02:14 and colom died he died without knowing without
00:02:18 knowing for sure that he had found a
00:02:20 new continent that  it was not asia later
00:02:24 in 1499 other people began to go to
00:02:32 the americas other people other
00:02:34 sailors also with ships began to
00:02:38 go to the americas from spain at
00:02:41 first only from spain and then
00:02:45 later from other countries and at that
00:02:49 time columbus columbus was viceroy and
00:02:54 governor of the indies governor
00:02:59 is the person who commands the person
00:03:02 who governs a territory not
00:03:06 and viceroy a viceroy is the person who
00:03:09 commands who commands instead of the king because
00:03:13 the king or queen was in spain and
00:03:18 could not directly  he could give orders
00:03:20 because he was very far away so a
00:03:23 viceroy is a person who commands instead
00:03:27 of the king and commands another in another place
00:03:30 that is far from the territory of the country
00:03:34 and Colom was governor and  he was viceroy and
00:03:38 colom was governor of hispaniola
00:03:43 hispaniola is an island that is here is the
00:03:47 island where haiti is and where is the
00:03:50 dominican republic
00:03:52 and colom reigned and ruled he was the
00:03:56 governor of this island
00:03:57 colom and his two brothers colom had two
00:04:01 brothers and  The three of them together ruled
00:04:04 this island, the Spanish one, but there were
00:04:07 problems, there were many problems,
00:04:11 there were many people, many sailors
00:04:13 who had gone from Spain, had gone to
00:04:16 the Americas, had gone there because
00:04:19 Colom had told them that there was a lot of
00:04:22 wealth, there was a lot of gold, there was a lot of
00:04:25 money, and they got there.  and they found out
00:04:28 what color he had lied to them he had
00:04:31 told them a lie there was not
00:04:34 really much wealth at least
00:04:37 not for them
00:04:39 and there was something worse
00:04:41 to colon to colon they accused him of using
00:04:45 torture of using mutilation to govern
00:04:50 of using torture or not of  to
00:04:53 hurt people or to use mutilation to
00:04:57 cut off fingers to cut off hands to
00:05:01 use mutilation as a way of
00:05:04 governing control  people and at a
00:05:08 time when the Native American Indians
00:05:12 were not happy with the
00:05:15 way Colom governed there was a
00:05:18 very strong repression a
00:05:20 brutal repression many natives
00:05:24 were killed and their
00:05:28 limbs were cut off their legs were cut off
00:05:31 their arms  and they scattered them on
00:05:35 the street they distributed them on the street
00:05:37 they threw them on the street
00:05:40 but queen
00:05:43 isabel queen isabel who at that time
00:05:45 ruled spain found out she found
00:05:49 out that colom was a very bad governor and
00:05:53 removed him removed him as governor then
00:05:56 colony  he was not he was no longer governor and the
00:06:00 queen the queen of spain really
00:06:03 wanted the indigenous native
00:06:06 americans to have the same rights
00:06:09 as the spaniards who were also
00:06:12 citizens who were at the same level
00:06:15 later in 1500
00:06:19 6
00:06:21 colom dies
00:06:25 colon dies yes yes and  Well, or the colon dies,
00:06:29 but the era of colonization
00:06:34 had already begun and all of Europe had
00:06:37 found out that  e america existed and
00:06:41 many countries began to
00:06:44 colonize looking for new territories
00:06:47 spain conquered central america and
00:06:52 conquered much of south america
00:06:56 and also conquered parts of south and
00:06:59 west of north america
00:07:03 also parts of africa like
00:07:05 equatorial guinea and western sahara and
00:07:09 then places like the  philippines the
00:07:12 philippines and other islands around here in the
00:07:15 pacific in the pacific ocean were
00:07:18 also conquered by spain and at this time at
00:07:23 this time thanks to marriages
00:07:26 marriages spain also
00:07:31 had belgium belgium also became
00:07:34 part of spain and spain also
00:07:37 conquered much of italy
00:07:40 Much of Italy also became part
00:07:43 of Spain and then, well, other countries
00:07:47 also began to conquer, they began
00:07:50 to conquer different parts of the world,
00:07:55 including
00:08:01 Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
00:08:08 All these countries began
00:08:10 to conquer territories
00:08:14 all over the world.
00:08:15 a difference therefore between the
00:08:19 manner  to conquer other countries
00:08:22 and the way to conquer spain'
00:08:26 and it is that when spain conquered a
00:08:30 new territory a new place
00:08:34 became part of the country it became one
00:08:37 more territory of the country while
00:08:40 other countries portugal france holland
00:08:44 united kingdom  when they conquered a
00:08:47 territory it became a colony it was not
00:08:51 part of the country but it was
00:08:53 property it was theirs like this
00:08:58 this cup is my property because the country
00:09:02 the area became their property and
00:09:06 the inhabitants the people who were
00:09:09 there were not citizens  they were not
00:09:11 considered citizens at the same level
00:09:14 as the people of the country no
00:09:18 but for spain' that was different in
00:09:22 theory queen isabel wanted the
00:09:27 new territories to be part of the country
00:09:29 simply to be spain' but in
00:09:33 practice something different happened something
00:09:36 quite different good happened
00:09:39 even the dad the dad the dad is the
00:09:43 leader of the catholic church of the
00:09:47 catholic christian church not the dad
00:09:50 is in rome est  in rome in
00:09:54 vatican city and the pope the pope said
00:09:58 that the native americans
00:10:02 were people they were men and women they
00:10:05 were human yes and that they had to be
00:10:09 considered the same as the europeans they
00:10:13 were also children of god no
00:10:17 but the dad
00:10:21 the  dad never said that africans
00:10:26 were men they were human no they were not
00:10:30 considered men the blacks of
00:10:33 africa did not consider them men and
00:10:36 women just like us that is why the
00:10:40 native americans the indigenous people
00:10:45 could not be enslaved they could not be
00:10:47 made slaves but blacks  It's okay,
00:10:52 blacks are not human, he said, I
00:10:55 don't know if he said it, but implicitly he never
00:10:59 said that blacks were
00:11:02 human, they were people,
00:11:05 that's why slavery was not allowed,
00:11:10 but well, in the case of indigenous people,
00:11:13 slavery was theoretically
00:11:15 prohibited, it was not allowed, but  in
00:11:18 practice a system was imposed a
00:11:21 system called parcels the
00:11:26 parcels I will put here once the
00:11:30 parcel system
00:11:33 it was a bit like the feudal lords the
00:11:36 feudal lords existed in
00:11:40 medieval times medieval times from the year
00:11:45 I don't know 500
00:11:47 to 1500
00:11:50 more or less it was medieval times the
00:11:54 time of horses and swords and knights
00:11:58 at this time there were feudal lords
00:12:02 there were  a castle
00:12:05 there was a castle and around it there were
00:12:08 fields fields fields
00:12:12 and all the people the farmers
00:12:15 the farmers the people who
00:12:19 grew grew food they had
00:12:23 to give a part to the feudal lord they
00:12:27 had to give a percentage to the lord
00:12:31 and here in the americas the system
00:12:36 The system of encomiendas was similar there was
00:12:39 a lord and the lord
00:12:43 the lord there was no there were no castles
00:12:45 but there was a lord and the lord was the
00:12:48 Spanish and the vassals were the natives
00:12:54 were the indigenous and the indigenous
00:12:57 were forced to work they had to
00:13:00 work yes yes  they could not rest and
00:13:04 fish and eat they did not have to
00:13:07 work and they had to give a
00:13:11 percentage also to the man to the Spanish
00:13:16 b  Good but the Spanish also had
00:13:19 obligations the vassals gave them
00:13:24 gave them things they gave them a percentage and the
00:13:28 Spanish in exchange taught them the
00:13:31 Christian religion made
00:13:34 them Catholics taught them well the bible taught them
00:13:37 to read Spanish
00:13:41 well that was their obligation ok you
00:13:45 work for  me and I in return
00:13:48 impose my religion on you good good treatment it is
00:13:52 a
00:13:54 very fair treatment surely
00:13:57 they thought it was a very
00:13:58 fair treatment the indigenous people and well
00:14:01 theoretically also the
00:14:03 parcel system was like that although sometimes in
00:14:07 practice  The vassals ended up being more or less
00:14:09 like slaves, those who
00:14:12 worked ended up being slaves, but
00:14:16 not always, so there were several laws, several laws were
00:14:20 made to prohibit the
00:14:24 encomienda system or to phase it
00:14:27 out, gradually leaving the
00:14:30 encomienda system, several laws were made,
00:14:33 but  they were ignored in
00:14:36 practice they were not applied until
00:14:40 in 1542
00:14:44 in 1542 the kings became serious they were
00:14:50 p  They used the parcels seriously, no,
00:14:54 we are going to remove them, they will no longer exist
00:14:57 and this time it worked better
00:15:01 than before and there were many places, many
00:15:04 places where the parcels were
00:15:08 abolished, they ceased to exist, but there were
00:15:12 places, there were places where they resisted,
00:15:16 yes, yes.  Spaniards who lived there
00:15:19 the conquistadors resisted they
00:15:22 did not want they did not want to release the people
00:15:27 they also had working for them
00:15:29 there were even wars wars were fought
00:15:33 to protect that system the
00:15:37 encomienda system for example in peru in
00:15:41 peru there was a war for that to
00:15:43 protect the encomiendas and then in
00:15:46 these places in these places where
00:15:49 the encomiendas were not abolished they continued to
00:15:51 function
00:15:53 and many Spaniards many conquistadors
00:15:57 stopped having vassals to have people
00:16:01 working for them
00:16:04 and so they began to attract slaves they
00:16:08 began to buy slaves to buy
00:16:12 slaves from other countries  to the united kingdom to the
00:16:16 netherlands to other countries that brought
00:16:18 slaves  s from africa from africa to the
00:16:22 americas they did not begin to buy those
00:16:26 sides it is estimated it is estimated that more or
00:16:29 less one million one million
00:16:34 five hundred thousand
00:16:40 slaves were brought from africa 1,500,000 only
00:16:44 in spanish territories yes yes there are
00:16:48 many again for  What I told you
00:16:50 before was that the indigenous were
00:16:54 considered human beings by their
00:16:57 father,
00:16:58 but blacks were not considered
00:17:00 human. Another problem that occurred in the
00:17:03 Americas is disease,
00:17:06 many people became ill,
00:17:09 especially the natives, especially the
00:17:12 indigenous.  many got sick and
00:17:16 died because the europeans brought
00:17:20 diseases diseases that did not
00:17:23 exist in the americas before
00:17:25 but the europeans also the europeans
00:17:28 also got sick they got
00:17:31 sick from diseases that did not
00:17:35 exist in europe and an example an
00:17:38 example of a disease is syphilis the
00:17:41 syphilis was brought by the Europeans who
00:17:45 went to the Americas and returned and
00:17:48 that is why syphilis later spread  It traveled through
00:17:51 Europe and up to here the summary of
00:17:55 the Spanish empire in the next video I will
00:17:59 explain to you during this same period
00:18:03 these same years I will explain to you what
00:18:05 happened in Spain what happened in Spain
00:18:09 during this time this period that is
00:18:11 worth come bye bye
00:18:15 and if you want to learn real Spanish  don't
00:18:20 forget that me and my friend adrián
00:18:23 have done the course of
00:18:25 colloquial spanish and marked swear words and I
00:18:30 leave you the link in the description ok

047,"00:00:00 Today I am going to explain what my vision is
00:00:04 for this channel for these videos what
00:00:08 is my vision what is the reason
00:00:12 why I started making the videos and
00:00:16 what is my dream where I want to go
00:00:19 no what is the ultimate goal of this
00:00:23 channel of these videos
00:00:26 [Music] well
00:00:32 as you can see I'm not in
00:00:37 china anymore now I'm not living in china
00:00:40 I'm back in thailand and
00:00:46 from now on I'm going to live here in
00:00:49 thailand in bangkok
00:00:52 but but today I'm not going to talk to you
00:00:55 Not about that today I want to talk about what my
00:01:00 dream is what my vision is for this channel
00:01:04 for the dreaming spanish
00:01:08 videos when I started recording the videos
00:01:12 when I started making these videos I
00:01:16 did it because I realized that it was something
00:01:19 that I didn't  Until then there
00:01:23 were no similar videos,
00:01:25 no videos that were so easy to understand,
00:01:29 neither in Spanish nor in any other
00:01:32 language
00:01:32 [Music]
00:01:34 In my case I tried and I tried to
00:01:38 start learning Chinese I wanted to learn
00:01:42 Chinese and I began to  turn it on and
00:01:47 I knew that to learn a language
00:01:50 well you have to listen you have to listen a
00:01:53 lot
00:01:55 but I started to watch videos in Chinese
00:01:58 I started to watch videos on YouTube to watch
00:02:02 cartoons to watch series I looked I
00:02:07 looked at many things but nothing nothing was
00:02:12 easy to understand nothing  It was
00:02:14 easy enough and I searched search
00:02:19 searched a lot searched and listened more or
00:02:24 less 100 hours of Chinese 100 hours of
00:02:27 videos in Chinese
00:02:31 but I realized that something like
00:02:35 this videos so easy to understand did not
00:02:39 exist I also searched for videos in English
00:02:42 because I have  many friends I have
00:02:46 family who want to learn English they
00:02:49 want to improve their level of English
00:02:53 they want to learn English but they
00:02:56 don't know what to do they don't know what to do to
00:02:58 learn and I told them that they had to
00:03:02 listen a lot they have to listen a
00:03:05 lot to improve improve their level of
00:03:09 English  and I sent them I sent them videos that
00:03:14 I thought were easy but
00:03:19 they weren't easy enough no
00:03:24 so in Chinese there wasn't in i  There was
00:03:27 n't any English either and I started to think
00:03:31 maybe the problem the problem is that
00:03:36 nothing like it doesn't exist nothing
00:03:40 easy enough to learn a
00:03:43 language so I started making videos and
00:03:48 I realized that there are a lot of people
00:03:52 who like videos  many of
00:03:56 you told me that you have never
00:04:00 seen videos so easy so easy to
00:04:04 understand
00:04:05 that's why I'm glad I'm so
00:04:08 glad that you guys think
00:04:12 these videos are useful
00:04:15 but my goal my dream is not
00:04:21 just to make a few videos to
00:04:23 make a few videos no no  My
00:04:27 goal is bigger My goal is to
00:04:31 make videos at all levels

00:04:38 any level can improve their Spanish
00:04:41 starting from scratch starting from the
00:04:45 base to high levels I
00:04:49 want dreaming Spanish to be the

00:00:34 Hello welcome welcome once again
00:00:39 to Dreaming  in Spanish I am Sofía and
00:00:43 today I am going to tell you about one
00:00:48 of the most popular festivals in Mexico,
00:00:52 the Day of the Dead, and everything you
00:00:57 need to know about the altars of the
00:01:02 dead. What is the main element of
00:01:06 this celebration on the Day of the Dead?  Muertos is
00:01:10 a very popular Mexican celebration of
00:01:15 pre-Hispanic origin, pre-
00:01:18 Hispanic means that it is many
00:01:22 many many
00:01:24 years back in history,
00:01:28 thousands and thousands of years, with the passage of
00:01:32 time, this Mexican tradition has
00:01:36 grown a lot and more people from all over the
00:01:41 world want to travel to Mexico.  to live
00:01:45 the experience of the Day of the Dead, the
00:01:50 belief says that on November 1
00:01:55 our loved ones who are no longer
00:01:59 with us  When they
00:02:00 return to earth from the afterlife they say
00:02:05 that they are welcomed on November 1st
00:02:09 and on November 2nd they
00:02:14 say goodbye to them and how we receive them
00:02:17 with all the things they loved
00:02:22 when they were alive and that is where
00:02:27 the altars of  dead this
00:02:31 tradition of putting altars
00:02:34 is considered a cultural heritage
00:02:38 of humanity by UNESCO and today I
00:02:43 share everything you need to know about
00:02:47 the altars of the dead and their
00:02:51 meaning the main thing you should
00:02:56 know is that the altars of the dead are
00:03:00 used to  to remember or to honor
00:03:06 our loved ones who have already
00:03:08 passed away So in an altar of the
00:03:12 dead you find all the
00:03:16 favorite things of the person who has already passed away
00:03:20 like their favorite food
00:03:23 their favorite drink their favorite clothes and the
00:03:30 food can be as simple
00:03:34 as pan de muerto  or as elaborate as a
00:03:39 chile relleno or as a delicious pozole
00:03:45 we can also find the
00:03:50 favorite games of the person who has already died, they
00:03:53 can be board games  or they can be
00:03:58 traditional games or any type of
00:04:02 game you will see everything that the person loved in
00:04:07 life on the altars the
00:04:12 altars are very, very colorful and can
00:04:18 have three or seven levels and obviously
00:04:24 the levels also have meaning
00:04:29 when they have three levels they represent
00:04:33 Heaven,
00:04:34 Earth and the Underworld and when it has
00:04:40 7 levels it represents the seven deadly
00:04:45 sins or the seven levels of
00:04:49 purgatory. What does it mean that they are all
00:04:53 the levels that a soul has to go through
00:04:57 until it can find peace Of course,
00:05:01 that is only the Mexican belief in
00:05:05 altars  of the dead have
00:05:09 very particular and very special
00:05:14 elements, each element has a meaning and
00:05:19 some of the most common elements are
00:05:25 salt, according to the belief, salt is used so that
00:05:30 the body of our loved one does not
00:05:34 break and can come and go from their world to
00:05:39 ours  every year the
00:05:44 ash cross the ash cross serves to purify
00:05:48 the soul of our loved one from
00:05:53 all sorrows and anguish  aunts that have candles
00:05:57 the candles serve to illuminate the path
00:06:02 of our deceased and so that he can
00:06:06 be well guided to and from
00:06:10 the deceased portrait or photo of the deceased this
00:06:15 represents the person who is being
00:06:19 remembered and the person who will visit us
00:06:23 that day for  both the photograph is
00:06:27 always placed in the upper part and in
00:06:31 the center of the altar food
00:06:34 cup of water this is placed because it is believed
00:06:38 that the deceased is tired from the
00:06:42 coming trip and it is believed that he is going to need
00:06:45 strength for the outward trip.
00:06:49 He puts his food and his favorite water so
00:06:52 that the Cempasúchil flowers can be strong
00:06:57 These are the
00:07:01 traditional and popular flowers of the Day of the
00:07:05 Dead.
00:07:16 I love it It
00:07:21 makes me feel very proud to be
00:07:24 Mexican and I look forward to it every year Now
00:07:28 tell me, did

00:00:14 hello I'm in Hong Kong I came to Hong
00:00:19 Kong for a week I'm here for a week I
00:00:22 had to leave Thailand I had to leave Thailand I had to
00:00:26 leave the country because
00:00:29 my visa was running out I had a
00:00:33 three-month visa in Thailand  It
00:00:37 's over and I had to leave so I
00:00:41 came to Hong Kong because
00:00:43 a friend of mine lives in Hong Kong. A friend lives here. He's
00:00:47 been here for about 78
00:00:49 years and well, this is the hostel.
00:00:57 a hostel a
00:00:59 hostel is a place where there are
00:01:00 dormitories there are rooms with bunk beds
00:01:04 with several beds and it's cheaper it's
00:01:08 cheaper than a hotel but it's hong kong and it
00:01:11 's quite expensive the truth is that
00:01:13 to build a hostel it's quite expensive
00:01:17 but hey I'm going  Let's talk a little about
00:01:20 Hong Kong because it's not my first time in
00:01:24 Hong Kong
00:01:25 I've been here several times and I'm going to
00:01:28 explain the city a bit
00:01:32 and what I think if I like Hong Kong or not
00:01:38 Hong Kong
00:01:39 is  it is different  It's a little different from the bank,
00:01:45 there's less,
00:01:47 I don't know, less, it
00:01:49 's less chaos, it's a little less chaos,
00:01:53 there's traffic, but there's not as much
00:01:56 traffic as in Hong Kong
00:01:59 [Music] It
00:02:00 's easier, for example, to walk on the
00:02:03 sidewalks, walk on the sidewalk,  there are
00:02:06 sidewalks that are wide enough
00:02:09 wide and there are not so many
00:02:12 problems walking on the sidewalk in
00:02:16 bangkok the sidewalk sometimes goes down sometimes
00:02:18 goes up sometimes you have to go out you have to
00:02:21 walk on the road you have to
00:02:25 walk on the asphalt because for
00:02:33 because you can't walk on the sidewalk
00:02:35 there are things or there is no sidewalk it's a bit more
00:02:39 chaos
00:02:40 but here Hong Kong there is a lot of noise I notice
00:02:45 that there is more noise I think it's because the
00:02:48 streets are narrow the streets
00:02:51 most of the streets are narrower than
00:02:53 bangkok and also the buildings are
00:02:57 very tall the buildings are very tall
00:03:00 and me where i live in the bank the area
00:03:03 where i live there are not so many very tall buildings
00:03:08 and in bangkok yes there are some there are
00:03:10 some buildings  They are very tall but there are not
00:03:13 so many of them so close together there are not tall buildings
00:03:15 very close together that is not why I think that here there is
00:03:19 more noise you can hear more noise from
00:03:22 cars and such
00:03:26 I would also say that Hong Kong is
00:03:29 cleaner it is a little cleaner there are not
00:03:32 so many  food places in the street are
00:03:34 more restaurants and such is not so much
00:03:38 street food
00:03:40 and that is why it is much cleaner
00:03:43 and well I think that people in
00:03:46 general are more careful, they are
00:03:49 more careful not to dirty and  It also
00:03:52 seems that people in Hong Kong
00:03:55 follow the rules more, they follow the rules more, such
00:03:58 as crosswalks, traffic lights,
00:04:00 we don't have traffic lights, because
00:04:04 when the traffic light is red,
00:04:07 normally normally people
00:04:10 stop and wait for the traffic light.
00:04:13 turn green not what else
00:04:17 hong kong in hong kong they speak enough
00:04:20 english in general most of the places
00:04:24 where you go will understand you well more or
00:04:28 less you can understand each other you can
00:04:29 communicate in english but what i have
00:04:33 noticed this  I've been here for a few days now
00:04:35 since Thursday I've been
00:04:39 here for four days and yes, I've noticed that there are a
00:04:44 lot of people who don't speak English, a
00:04:46 lot of people who only speak
00:04:48 Cantonese,
00:04:51 but there are also a lot of people who
00:04:54 speak Cantonese, speak Mandarin, speak
00:04:56 English, yes, it's amazing.  a lot of
00:05:00 people who spoke several languages ​​and I
00:05:03 like I like that atmosphere of people
00:05:06 who communicate on a daily basis in
00:05:08 different languages
00:05:14 there are also certain areas of the city
00:05:17 some areas that are very cosmopolitan
00:05:22 are very there are people from many places people
00:05:26 from many places  different here - this
00:05:29 area I think is more local people people
00:05:32 from Hong Kong but if you go to other places
00:05:36 in the city to Colom with a column
00:05:40 where I was with the other time
00:05:44 I came to my hotel I was in Colon and you
00:05:48 could see  people from many places we saw a
00:05:50 lot of people from india or pakistan a
00:05:54 lot of western people also from europe
00:05:56 or the united states
00:05:59 and it is also a very very
00:06:03 interesting environment many types of re  restaurants
00:06:06 from all sides restaurants from
00:06:09 all countries
00:06:10 yesterday we went to eat vietnam
00:06:14 food vietnamese food
00:06:16 and the day before we went to eat
00:06:20 thai food and it was not my idea
00:06:26 also in hong kong there are many cars
00:06:28 many expensive cars here you see a tesla  And
00:06:31 there is another landslide, that is, many
00:06:34 Porsches, also many expensive cars, look
00:06:36 here another, another Tesla,

00:09:24 went climbing, climbing, doing
00:09:27 bull behring building, it is climbing but
00:09:30 without  rope you don't have a rope and that
00:09:34 short climb isn't
00:09:37 very high it's not very high and how lazy to go up
00:09:40 I'm going down I'm going down I don't want to I don't
00:09:44 want to start to start sweating well
00:09:47 yes we went to do vulneren in
00:09:50 a gym somewhere
00:09:54 closed it's not outside
00:09:59 that you pay you pay for a day and you can go
00:10:02 there and climb they have walls they have
00:10:05 walls with stones and you can
00:10:08 you can climb you can practice climbing
00:10:10 no and it's not very high it's not very high you
00:10:14 practice I don't know 34 meters and that's it
00:10:19 then  it is very easy anyone can
00:10:22 start can start practicing it is not necessary to
00:10:25 know how to use the ropes
00:10:27 how to use the material the material
00:10:31 for climbing not
00:10:35 here it seems that there is a park I will take
00:10:37 you takes you  I'll go to the park where there's a
00:10:40 traffic light there's a traffic light
00:10:46 so people look at me look and smile it
00:10:51 's the first time
00:10:54 I didn't already made a video like this
00:10:56 in the park in the park there in
00:10:58 bangkok but there weren't not many
00:11:00 people but here  in hong kong people
00:11:03 look there smile because they see
00:11:05 that i'm recording a video no well
00:11:08 i'm not very used to making this type
00:11:11 of video a blog style no
00:11:14 but well i guess i'll
00:11:16 get used to seeing what to see how to see
00:11:20 if  I'm not used to it and I'm less ashamed to
00:11:22 record like this in public no
00:11:28 and yes I have come to Hong Kong several times
00:11:31 because when I was living in Japan
00:11:34 when I lived in Japan
00:11:36 I already had the opportunity to come
00:11:39 to Hong Kong several times
00:11:41 and I always like it  I like to
00:11:44 come but it's an expensive place it's quite
00:11:47 expensive
00:11:48 compared to compared to china compared to
00:11:52 thailand compared
00:11:54 to taiwan that's a bit sweet
00:12:04 especially
00:12:07 if you live here if you have to pay
00:12:10 rent you have to pay a flat or something well
00:12:12 It is quite expensive but to
00:12:16 find places to eat and such I
00:12:19 would say that it is a little cheaper than
00:12:20 'spain a little cheaper but the
00:12:24 hostel the hostel where I am
00:12:26 surely is a little more expensive than
00:12:28 spain a little more expensive than the
00:12:31 hostels in spain  '
00:12:34 sorry, there's no traffic light here,
00:12:38 there isn't, it's not the steam, I didn't run
00:12:40 the red light, don't worry
00:12:43 but well, worried because
00:12:45 the truck almost almost ran over me
00:12:49 [Music]
00:12:55 and well with with it's fine there aren't many
00:12:58 things there aren't many things  What to see but
00:13:01 if you come for four or five days
00:13:04 I think you will like it you can see
00:13:07 most things in four or five days does it
00:13:10 have a park has a
00:13:14 market a night market or no no that is not to
00:13:17 say it is night but it has a market
00:13:19 on the street that  It's also very
00:13:21 good they
00:13:22 have a statue of a Buddha on the
00:13:25 mountain you can go see the Buddha it's also
00:13:27 good it
00:13:29 's like a children's park look I'll show you
00:13:32 well a children's park for
00:13:35 people singing too
00:13:38 and there's a  field sports field to
00:13:41 play soccer and basketball
00:13:46 well I think we can stay
00:13:49 here no
00:13:50 [Music]
00:13:52 and well if you have the opportunity to
00:13:54 come to Hong Kong I recommend it is a
00:13:57 different place
00:14:01 I think not everyone not
00:14:03 everyone  you know but they speak cantonese here
00:14:06 in hong kong the language of
00:14:09 most people is cantonese it is not
00:14:11 mandarin chinese it is not the most common chinese in
00:14:14 china
00:14:16 and the other day i went to the consulate i went to the
00:14:19 consulate of thailand because i have to
00:14:23 get a visa i want  request a new
00:14:25 tourist visa for thailand and i went
00:14:29 there and there was a couple there was a
00:14:32 latin american woman and a man from
00:14:34 latin america the woman was from colombia and
00:14:37 the name was from peru
00:14:41 and they were telling me that they were
00:14:43 using the translator on the mobile they were
00:14:46 using the  translator for Chinese for
00:14:48 Mandarin but they did not understand the
00:14:50 taxi driver did not understand them when they used the
00:14:52 translator
00:14:54 and they realized that they do not
00:14:57 speak Mandarin Chinese and they do not speak
00:14:59 Chinese anymore  usual not I thought that
00:15:02 most people knew it I knew that in
00:15:04 Hong Kong they spoke another language
00:15:06 but well not everyone knows it
00:15:09 seems to be
00:15:10 [Music]
00:15:11 I don't know what a plane is or something there is something
00:15:14 that makes a lot of noise it
00:15:16 will be a  plane but
00:15:19 but hey if you have the opportunity to
00:15:21 come to hong kong for a few days I

096,"00:00:00 your pillar where are you from
00:00:04 I get the cramp okay but now you don't
00:00:07 live in Colombia not where you live
00:00:12 okay well today I want you to tell us the
00:00:17 differences the differences between
00:00:19 Colombia and Spain
00:00:25 [Music]
00:00:28 hello hello pillar now the palm how
00:00:32 are they very well and you a  white it's not
00:00:35 very hot today well we are at the
00:00:38 beginning of april and it has rained a little
00:00:42 and the weather was changing no it
00:00:46 hasn't been hot for a long time still here
00:00:48 i am here where very hot
00:00:52 if you are in bangkok and now
00:00:58 the summer is starting the heat is starting  Well,
00:01:01 we here in Spain soon have
00:01:06 to take advantage of
00:01:08 enjoying these days when it's not
00:01:11 so hot because it's silly,
00:01:14 and also because you're in
00:01:16 Mérida
00:01:23 and it's very hot, 40 degrees
00:01:33 for many days, so there's a lot of
00:01:37 suffering, but you're far from the sea,
00:01:41 right?  and we are not in the
00:01:45 interior of the nearest beach I would say
00:01:49 that it is to the south towards Andalusia about
00:01:54 23 hours I would say
00:02:02 not but here not long ago  very cold
00:02:06 in winter no winter is mild it doesn't
00:02:10 rain either but it doesn't do like the king
00:02:15 like in many parts of spain it
00:02:17 snows and it's very cold here no
00:02:26 but still winter will be colder
00:02:30 than in colombian
00:02:32 well that's one of the great
00:02:34 differences because I was
00:02:37 used to the fact that in Colombia we
00:02:40 do not have seasons the weather does not change
00:02:43 in this very practical way during the
00:02:46 year we remain with the same
00:02:50 temperature throughout the year and
00:02:53 some months are rainier other
00:02:56 months are a little hotter but
00:02:59 no
00:03:00 and no  We have these changes like this and all
00:03:04 year long you can go with short bands. Well,
00:03:07 where I live in Bogotá, it has been a
00:03:11 bit cold. Base on which it changes
00:03:14 during the day, the temperature in the
00:03:17 morning is very cold at noon, it is a
00:03:21 little hotter.  and then at night it's
00:03:23 cold again
00:03:27 so we may have the
00:03:29 stations during the same day and then
00:03:34 before this cold wave so
00:03:37 you always have to wear a jacket or something
00:03:39 if we will have the exact thing where I live it is
00:03:44 normal to be in a jacket and then
00:03:47 have to take it off and then put it up again it
00:03:50 is a bit like May June and
00:03:54 October again in Spanish the factoring
00:03:57 is like this temperature but permanent
00:03:59 throughout the year
00:04:01 so the  When I came here to Europe,
00:04:06 the first difference I found was
00:04:11 these climate changes and when I
00:04:14 watched television they always showed
00:04:22 the weather forecast and
00:04:26 that seemed super strange to me because they had
00:04:29 to say what temperature the government was and
00:04:31 how I was doing in  or in Colombian we
00:04:35 go out and we never know if we are interested in
00:04:37 knowing what is going to happen at 9 every day or at the
00:04:43 same time anything can be felt, well,
00:04:46 but we are
00:04:49 not paying attention, we are not paying attention, we are not listening to what is going
00:04:53 to be cold, it could be anything.
00:04:59 can you predict that I was going to ask
00:05:02 you, the Colombians
00:05:04 don't care, you don't care, wet West,
00:05:07 the weather is unpredictable in the
00:05:09 unpredictable, so you can  prepare
00:05:12 a great one
00:05:12 that is there and that day it rains and it is not a
00:05:16 great tragedy nor is it a problem because it
00:05:19 can happen, you have a 50 or 50
00:05:24 percent probability but instead here
00:05:31 people schedule more
00:05:33 so that the day whatever for example
00:05:37 now what  it's going to be holy week
00:05:40 everyone is asking that please on
00:05:44 wednesday and thursday it doesn't rain
00:05:48 the terrible second many times in
00:05:52 spain maybe yes with the family it
00:05:55 's a one day trip you want to go to the
00:05:58 amusement park or the beach for a
00:06:00 few days  before you look at the weather
00:06:03 and decide if you are going to plan it or
00:06:06 not no
00:06:07 [Music]
00:06:09 so that is also at the beginning it
00:06:11 seemed to me that there was a
00:06:15 television program dedicated solely to this
00:06:17 for half an hour in the US it has an
00:06:23 entire channel
00:06:27 but this job doesn't work in
00:06:30 colombia someone dedicated to predicting the
00:06:34 weather in colombia
00:06:38 [Laughter]
00:06:42 tell me tell me about the difference in
00:06:45 the personality of people between
00:06:48 colombia and spain
00:06:50 well
00:06:54 i think  In any case, it is
00:06:59 generalizing a lot as a Colombian or
00:07:01 as a Spaniard or as an Italian
00:07:04 one, we all have a stereotype, a
00:07:09 way of thinking culturally that
00:07:13 we have always heard how
00:07:15 non-deserted people are
00:07:17 from a certain country,
00:07:21 I do not see many differences in the
00:07:25 emotional aspect because in Colombia and
00:07:30 in Spain we are like careful to
00:07:32 share our emotions and we are
00:07:34 happy or sad or someone seems boring to us we
00:07:45 express with the teachers and we
00:07:55 express with hugs kisses we
00:08:04 touch people in other places because it
00:08:08 is not like that for example in England  There is a
00:08:12 note that they are very, very serious and very
00:08:16 and internalize what they feel,
00:08:21 they are always very kind and
00:08:24 ask you how you are, but in reality they
00:08:26 do not want to know how to buy
00:08:30 [Laughs] They
00:08:33 want me to tell you
00:08:37 your way, that is a way to start the
00:08:42 conversation  On the other hand, here or in
00:08:46 Colombia
00:08:48 like this and you can sit after half an
00:08:51 hour of standing compared to the
00:08:57 English because l  he Spaniards and
00:08:58 Colombians are quite similar,
00:09:00 right in short,
00:09:02 so in that I do
00:09:07 n't really find big
00:09:09 differences, not even in the
00:09:13 way the food is, you miss
00:09:16 Colombian food
00:09:19 at the beginning when I left
00:09:23 Colombia, the first one didn't know how to cook, it
00:09:27 wasn't like something, something like alchemy that they
00:09:31 did in my house and
00:09:35 what he did and the others who ate came out
00:09:37 but I didn't know how to do it how old
00:09:39 you were when you left
00:09:44 I don't want to reveal my age but
00:09:50 you had never lived  Or you alone it
00:09:53 is not a difference but not in Spain
00:09:56 we are also very familiar that
00:09:58 we continue to live in our house
00:10:05 in our house with our parents
00:10:07 we were not like in the
00:10:11 United States or in England that
00:10:13 boys are 19 years old or even before  They
00:10:17 leave their house
00:10:19 so I was always
00:10:22 with my family at home and it was like the sorrows
00:10:25 that there was always someone who
00:10:27 always cooked so I didn't worry
00:10:29 because I never  I was going to need it but
00:10:33 when I left I discovered that or not the
00:10:36 ability
00:10:40 and then later trying to make and
00:10:44 copy what I saw in my house
00:10:48 trying to make those dishes
00:10:50 well the problem you find here is
00:10:52 that they generally don't find the two ingredients
00:10:55 No, it's not so, so I
00:10:57 try to replace them with others, but I've
00:11:02 learned to make a lot
00:11:05 of dishes from my house and also Spanish
00:11:08 because I don't have to integrate into Spanish cuisine
00:11:12 , which is not very difficult because
00:11:14 everything is very delicious, exquisite food and the
00:11:22 variety of  Dishes
00:11:25 are incredible
00:11:29 in Colombia like Colombia when you want to
00:11:32 learn how to make a Colombian dish
00:11:35 how do you learn you ask your mom or
00:11:39 the first thing is to call my house and
00:11:42 ask how they do it
00:11:45 and have them tell me the instructions
00:11:48 before looking at the recipe in  a book
00:11:52 is always better the food you
00:11:54 are used to not the food at home
00:11:58 that you screwed me up the comparison is made if they
00:12:01 always think it does not come out the same as
00:12:03 What does my mother do but well, there
00:12:09 she goes, the taste gets used to it, although my
00:12:12 children have never gotten used to eating
00:12:15 rice, what we in Colombia
00:12:18 always eat rice, here in Spain they
00:12:20 eat a lot of bread,
00:12:25 how can a family eat two
00:12:28 loaves of bread all
00:12:32 [Laughter]
00:12:38 We eat rice but my children don't
00:12:40 like the food, so Colombian cuisine
00:12:45 has a lot of rice
00:12:47 to accompany it, almost always there
00:12:50 is rice to accompany it, here it is the bread,
00:12:54 there are other differences between
00:12:57 Colombian and Spanish food, which is that  You have to
00:13:00 be like that, very very different. For example, watch out for
00:13:02 wine, they always take wine to accompany and
00:13:06 we do, but only for
00:13:08 festivities
00:13:11 and wine is always there for everyone.
00:13:14 Maikel has to have a great
00:13:16 celebration that lends wine at home,
00:13:19 whereas in Colombia the wine is
00:13:21 exclusively for parties for
00:13:23 celebrations for special occasions
00:13:27 u2 is it a drink with food at noon
00:13:29 or not in spain it is very common you don't go to a
00:13:34 bar to eat and in  the menu already includes
00:13:36 wine, you don't have to pay for it at last and
00:13:40 the pie is very affordable very very cheap
00:13:44 compared, for example, to England, which
00:13:47 is a bottle of wine
00:13:51 that is super expensive compared here
00:13:56 cheaper than water because a lot is produced
00:14:00 so for me it was  as a duty
00:14:10 that people with the community always
00:14:12 drank wine
00:14:15 obviously in my house my husband has
00:14:21 had to change to the
00:14:23 Colombian style badly that I ballistics
00:14:29 prohibits him from drinking wine with food no
00:14:32 but at home we do it
00:14:34 when we go out yes the  baby came
00:14:38 but at home we never do
00:14:43 thank you very much there is something more than some
00:14:46 difference you want to comment
00:14:49 and well
00:14:51 I come from Colombia and the difference you
00:14:55 find here is a sense of
00:14:58 security and I don't know how I eat in the
00:15:03 environment as well it is also that
00:15:05 we live in a very quiet city and it
00:15:07 dies sometimes we leave the door
00:15:10 open we don't even realize it
00:15:14 and nothing happens instead the
00:15:19 way I grew up and lived around it was e  This
00:15:24 feeling of insecurity
00:15:26 that something that
00:15:28 you are afraid of is always going to happen to you is a
00:15:32 very unpleasant physical sensation that when I am here it
00:15:36 is a rule that it is something
00:15:41 different
00:15:43 in Colombia I always go down carefully
00:15:47 yes well when I was a teenager
00:15:53 at the university during  At that time in
00:15:56 Colombia there were many problems of
00:16:00 drug trafficking and insecurity
00:16:03 in this sense, not then I experienced
00:16:05 many scenes and many moments of
00:16:09 detention and insecurity where
00:16:13 you couldn't even go out for a ride in a car
00:16:17 outside the city because people were
00:16:19 afraid  that something happened to her
00:16:23 like this feeling of walking down the
00:16:25 street and she is always looking and
00:16:27 always careful of her bag that they do
00:16:31 something to you that someone approaches because they are
00:16:33 going to do something to you or that you are going to be in a moment
00:16:37 a wrong place at the
00:16:38 wrong time
00:16:41 that did not happen to me because I was in
00:16:45 an explosion of a terrorist attack
00:16:53 that took place in Bogotá
00:16:55 and I mean like
00:16:59 God  He put me here I don't know how we got
00:17:07 out of that but it was this
00:17:11 permanent feeling that fear
00:17:16 not before and after because it was a
00:17:21 constant daily situation that we saw
00:17:24 on the news on the radio and it wasn't
00:17:27 something that happened anywhere else it was there
00:17:29 when it could happen to any of us we
00:17:31 always heard from a
00:17:33 friend or neighbor that something had happened
00:17:37 to him that his cousin had been taken away
00:17:40 from his uncle he was always there permanently
00:17:45 if it was the feeling when it was
00:17:49 my turn because anyone  It
00:17:53 wasn't just because it was this
00:17:57 or that, because I'm going to continue to get there,
00:18:00 so that feeling with which
00:18:03 we grew up at that time was a
00:18:08 terrible anxiety and when I came here
00:18:10 to Europe
00:18:14 that it did exist daily in your life
00:18:17 when  you get up and when you are on the
00:18:19 street that is something like a relief
00:18:25 because a situation like new that I
00:18:28 had not experienced now Colombian is much
00:18:33 better that yes now it has improved it is
00:18:36 better and now  now people too and
00:18:40 even both the boys now that they don't know
00:18:44 how it was before
00:18:47 because they don't recognize that way
00:18:50 as we thought I
00:18:54 'm not happy I'm very glad that people
00:18:56 don't have fear or that feeling of
00:19:01 being
00:19:04 permanently afraid of
00:19:07 I'm scared that something won't happen and neither are
00:19:11 you afraid for
00:19:13 your family that is in Colombia, well,
00:19:20 thank you very much, thank you, Pilar,
00:19:23 for telling us the differences between
00:19:26 Colombia and Spain,
00:19:28 here, Pablo, thank you and I also hope that
00:19:31 you come back soon, come now

00:01:57 character you have in mind Ok
00:02:01 then I can ask all the questions
00:02:04 I need and all the questions
00:02:08 count
00:02:10 less  the questions that have no
00:02:14 answer if you ask me a question or
00:02:16 I ask you a question and you tell me I
00:02:19 don't know or that question does not apply to this
00:02:23 case well well that question does not count

00:07:00 family Ok she lives alone I don't know Oh no don't

00:07:08 Disney animated movie my m  entity is blank
00:07:12 this woman has black hair you
00:07:15 can't answer
00:07:17 [Music]
00:07:19 no she doesn't have black hair
00:07:23 normally villains have black hair in Disney
00:07:25 I don't know why but
00:07:28 Ok Ok this woman works
00:07:35 I don't know I do
00:07:39 n't tell how I don't tell this
00:07:47 How do you ask Disney villains? Oh guys, don't invent it, it
00:07:53 's not that easy, eh? Or maybe I'm too
00:07:56 bad for this, you have to keep
00:07:59 asking me questions. This woman is tall,
00:08:03 yes,
00:08:07 normal.
00:08:18 the protagonist of this story
00:08:21 is an
00:08:25 adolescent girl or a minor
00:08:27 Ah no no no ok
00:08:33 The good one no The answer is no Ok in
00:08:38 this movie where this character is
00:08:41 there are animals how they act animals are
00:08:44 yes animals Yes there are animals but
00:08:47 animals that talk Yes there are animals that
00:08:50 they talk Okay what
00:08:54 Disney It's weird huh I don't know why we talk
00:08:56 to animals animals that talk Okay yes
00:09:00 yes yes it's like
00:09:03 that animals that talk but I don't remember
00:09:06 any Villains in that movie  This
00:09:08 movie was one of the first three four
00:09:11 of Disney
00:09:12 no not one of the first three or four of
00:09:16 Disney no
00:09:17 Ok talking animals a woman is not a
00:09:22 witch this woman is a queen No she is not
00:09:26 a queen How many questions do I have 21 21
00:09:31 this woman is beautiful she is  Pretty, no, she's not
00:09:35 beautiful, she's not pretty, she's not good, or by God,
00:09:38 ugly, and she's not a witch. That's weird.
00:09:53 I see that not
00:09:57 too easy and not Ok This movie is
00:10:02 a this movie this character is a
00:10:05 stepmother
00:10:06 No it's not a stepmother Oh it can't be
00:10:11 what the hell is this this character
00:10:14 has long hair
00:10:17 like long or after the shoulder No no he doesn't
00:10:22 have hair  long this is a person
00:10:25 who is over 40 years old
00:10:29 possibly if he is over 40 years old 40
00:10:33 years old and is ugly from an animated movie
00:10:38 soul what character did you think of I think
00:10:42 that when you guess it he goes on to say Ah
00:10:46 Yes of course but right now no no Clar  or
00:10:51 I think it's quite well known I don't
00:10:55 think you're going to tell me Oh I
00:10:58 don't know that character I don't think I hope I
00:11:02 hope not Ok then you already know that she
00:11:06 is a Villain who is ugly who is bad
00:11:11 who has no family and who goes out in a
00:11:16 The movie with talking animals is What
00:11:20 Talking Animals and that confuses me a
00:11:22 lot and that it's not a witch is even
00:11:25 clearer so I thought it would be easy
00:11:28 because many villains are witches but
00:11:34 there are very few Disney villains who aren't witches
00:11:38 Not if there are  few but the
00:11:43 only ones that I remember are stepmothers of course
00:11:46 the stepmothers but this is not a
00:11:49 stepmother Well I think the options
00:11:52 are very limited this movie only
00:11:57 has as part 1 there is no part 2 What
00:12:00 is the question yes I know like only one
00:12:03 movie of there is only  a movie with
00:12:06 this character No it's not just one what the
00:12:10 heck Okay
00:12:12 there are several movies it's a woman ok
00:12:16 but this these movies are like part
00:12:19 2 of this movie yes Ok then there are
00:12:22 several movies
00:12:24 Don't invent I'm  very lost well she is
00:12:28 a
00:12:30 bad ugly villain from a movie or from several other
00:12:37 movies where there are animals that
00:12:41 speak she is not the protagonist She
00:12:44 is the villain
00:12:45 Exactly the protagonist of the story of
00:12:49 this movie Son is an animal Yes
00:12:53 I don't know if my questions help me  confuse
00:12:56 me more or help me
00:12:59 Ok so this this character is
00:13:03 against an animal that's very good
00:13:09 I'm confused
00:13:12 this animal from the movie is it's a
00:13:17 four-legged animal Yes this animal
00:13:20 that is the protagonist walks on two two
00:13:24 legs two feet two legs  no don't walk
00:13:28 four yes they are your God what a
00:13:31 strange movie
00:13:36 Yes when you find out when you find out
00:13:41 you're going to say Ah well of course it
00:13:44 's easy no
00:13:47 How many questions have you got 29
00:13:51 questions Oh I don't think this is the
00:13:53 game that I've asked the most questions yes yes
00:13:57 no no the last time it was 37
00:14:02 Ok
00:14:04 so I think I'm bad he
00:14:06 [Laughter]
00:14:08 come on Andrea you can do it
00:14:12 you can ask me more questions about
00:14:16 all the elements that we have mentioned
00:14:20 Yes this ani  evil is a the animal the
00:14:24 protagonist is a is a is a monkey no
00:14:28 is not a monkey
00:14:30 this person has dark colored
00:14:36 skin no does not have dark colored skin
00:14:42 this this person is wearing clothes
00:14:46 fine like clothes not old like dirty
00:14:52 okay no no  no no it doesn't go well sometimes if
00:14:55 this character is well dressed this
00:14:56 woman is well dressed Yes she is well
00:14:59 dressed
00:15:02 Why Because an adult
00:15:05 would be against an animal
00:15:09 Why would an adult in a
00:15:12 Disney movie be
00:15:16 against an  animal
00:15:19 an adult person a well-
00:15:23 dressed person is against an animal How
00:15:27 strange How strange
00:15:29 because
00:15:33 and Surely I saw this movie
00:15:35 millions of times but I don't remember I
00:15:38 don't know if you've seen it millions of times I
00:15:40 haven't seen it millions of times but
00:15:44 yes enough to
00:15:46 remember yes yes and it has no
00:15:51 magical powers so something
00:15:54 if it doesn't have magical powers but it's
00:15:57 mauve
00:15:59 it can't be no
00:16:03 who who is Andrea who is
00:16:07 it I don't think so what's up with my mind I hope
00:16:12 it is  this person because if I'm not
00:16:15 dead let's see let's see I don't remember his name
00:16:18 oh no yes yes of course No I have not confused his
00:16:21 name but this

00:20:44 mind But when you told me that it

054,"00:00:00 Today I am going to explain my story, my
00:00:04 story with languages, the reason why
00:00:09 I am now making these videos and
00:00:14 how I got here
00:00:17 [Music]
00:00:22 good, well, I went to university,
00:00:28 I studied at the university in Spain,
00:00:33 in Barcelona, ​​but I
00:00:38 I didn't study at university I didn't study languages ​​I didn't study
00:00:43 linguistics I didn't study English or other
00:00:47 languages ​​no no I studied computer science I
00:00:52 studied computer science I studied computers
00:00:55 no electronic database programming
00:01:00 yes
00:01:03 then why because now I'm
00:01:07 interested in languages ​​because now I'm
00:01:11 teaching Spanish no well you'll see  In
00:01:19 my last year at university in the
00:01:22 last year of my degree I went to
00:01:25 study abroad I went to study
00:01:29 in another country yes
00:01:33 and to go to go abroad
00:01:36 I wanted to improve my level my level of
00:01:40 English I wanted to learn to learn more
00:01:44 English
00:01:46 because at school when I was
00:01:49 little at school in high school
00:01:52 I also learned English I studied English
00:01:56 but my level of English was  good, like
00:02:01 the rest, like the other students, the
00:02:04 other students in high school weren't
00:02:08 very good, we couldn't speak English, no,
00:02:12 but to go to Finland, I started to
00:02:17 watch television in English, to watch
00:02:21 series, to watch movies, to watch
00:02:26 cartoons like Futurama or  the
00:02:30 simpsons
00:02:32 and when i went to finland my
00:02:37 level of english was good it was pretty
00:02:40 good pretty good
00:02:43 and i realized one thing there was one
00:02:49 thing i realized and it was that there were
00:02:53 things about english about the english language things
00:02:57 about the grammar of  the English phrases
00:03:01 that I knew I knew how to say them well I
00:03:06 knew how they sounded well and how they did not sound
00:03:10 well but I did not know because I
00:03:16 had never never studied this grammar
00:03:20 at school these phrases I
00:03:23 had never studied at school but I
00:03:26 knew if they sounded  well or it sounded bad
00:03:31 then or I realized take care you don't
00:03:35 need to study but I thought I
00:03:40 thought that intermediate level has
00:03:44 advanced if you could you could do that
00:03:47 but I didn't  Or did I know that to start to
00:03:53 start from scratch to start from a
00:03:56 beginner to study to learn a
00:04:00 language it's the same it's the same
00:04:04 and I realized that with Japanese I
00:04:10 studied I started studying Japanese in
00:04:15 2010
00:04:17 in 2010 I went to Japan but before before
00:04:23 after going to japan about six months about six
00:04:27 months half a year before going to japan i
00:04:31 started learning i started studying
00:04:35 japanese and i found a website a
00:04:40 website called asad
00:04:44 j at&amp;t no english is japan is all
00:04:51 the time
00:04:52 and
00:04:54 that  web was like
00:04:58 a revelation it was as if
00:05:03 an angel appeared or because that web on that web
00:05:07 said if you can learn grammar
00:05:12 you can learn what sounds good what
00:05:16 sounds bad in a language
00:05:18 from scratch if not
00:05:23 just intermediate  has progressed no no from
00:05:26 beginner intermediate and from zero to
00:05:30 zero to beginner all the way
00:05:33 you can do the same you can listen
00:05:38 you can read
00:05:40 and that's enough
00:05:43 and so I thought so this guy yes
00:05:49 this guy the guy who  and he writes that he
00:05:53 writes there that he writes all japan is
00:05:56 all the time if he can I can too I
00:06:00 can too if then I did the
00:06:04 same I began to listen to listen to a lot of
00:06:08 Japanese to read to read a lot of Japanese
00:06:13 and then later I went to Japan and it was
00:06:18 very  Well, it went very well for me and I saw that
00:06:22 I spoke better, I spoke better than other
00:06:27 people than other foreigners who
00:06:30 were in soap
00:06:32 and so, well, I was there for a while, I spent
00:06:37 several years in total, I was more or less
00:06:41 four years in Japan,
00:06:44 but in Japan I got bored in  japan
00:06:49 also i was studying computer science i
00:06:54 was doing research
00:06:57 research means to search to search
00:07:01 and discover new things to
00:07:04 think of new things that did not
00:07:08 exist before or to think of new computer programs
00:07:14 but i was not motivated i had no
00:07:19 motivation i was bored and i decided to
00:07:25 change i decided to change my life and
00:07:29 work work of something else of a
00:07:33 different thing and I
00:07:37 thought that I can help people
00:07:41 with computers I did not know how  I
00:07:45 couldn't help other people
00:07:49 but with languages ​​learning Spanish
00:07:53 learning Japanese learning English not
00:07:57 with languages
00:07:58 I thought yes yes I can help other
00:08:03 people I know how to learn how to
00:08:08 speak another language in a
00:08:12 fun way in a very fun way no need to
00:08:15 study  And how can I reach
00:08:19 a level at a very good level and in this way I
00:08:23 can help more people I can
00:08:27 help many many people and that's why
00:08:31 I decided to change fields change the field
00:08:37 in which I worked and start doing
00:08:40 this no  start making videos these
00:08:45 videos were later they were
00:08:48 later but I already decided in 2013
00:08:54 in 2013 I decided to change and
00:08:58 start making languages

259,"00:00:00 no children don't need it and
00:00:04 neither do you
00:00:07 [Music]
00:00:11 Hello, well Today I come again to destroy
00:00:16 another myth yes And this is the myth that
00:00:21 they have to teach us
00:00:24 pronunciation to say the c and j and r
00:00:29 the sounds of the language we are
00:00:33 learning  that we are studying that
00:00:36 they have to teach us or that we
00:00:40 have to study it So the
00:00:43 argument that some Use the myth that they
00:00:48 spread is that good but children
00:00:52 also need help children
00:00:57 sometimes do not know how to say the s they do not speak with
00:01:00 s's and they speak like this  Saying all the
00:01:03 times as if they were Zetas, no. And since
00:01:07 children need help,
00:01:10 well, adults
00:01:11 also need help. Conclusion of
00:01:15 this video, right off the bat, no, children
00:01:19 in general, most of them don't need it, and
00:01:23 neither do you, bye-bye, no, I'm not going to
00:01:28 explain.  Let's see in more detail, as
00:01:31 you already know, all these videos conclude with the fact
00:01:35 that you don't have to study input input
00:01:39 input and that's it Okay, but I'm going to
00:01:42 explain why and I'm going to explain
00:01:45 why this is  a myth and why is it
00:01:48 different from the fact that some children
00:01:51 do need to go to a speech therapist to go to a
00:01:55 person who helps them correct how they
00:01:59 pronounce things and that it is different
00:02:02 from the problems that
00:02:05 people who learn Spanish or who learn Spanish normally have
00:02:09 a language as adults and as
00:02:13 adults So let's see how The
00:02:16 problems are different for children to start with
00:02:22 99% of the children have no
00:02:26 problem they have no problems when they are
00:02:28 little yes they do not pronounce a letter
00:02:31 correctly but usually almost
00:02:34 always when  they grow
00:02:36 automatically they correct it they fix it they
00:02:40 begin to speak well without needing
00:02:43 any kind of help any kind of
00:02:46 correction So this already makes us
00:02:50 think that something is different with
00:02:53 adults because when adults
00:02:56 learn a foreign language here are
00:03:00 the majority who have problems when
00:03:04 pronounce the language they are
00:03:07 learning then these 1% of children
00:03:11 who have trouble pronouncing
00:03:13 some let  After these problems
00:03:16 are always with specific sounds with
00:03:20 specific sounds that are objectively
00:03:24 difficult they are difficult to pronounce
00:03:27 you have to do something strange with your mouth
00:03:30 that it is not easy to say
00:03:35 the letter m for example the letter m no one has any
00:03:39 problem saying the letter m  person
00:03:42 any child who learns any
00:03:45 language that has the letter m never has a
00:03:49 problem when they reach a certain age
00:03:51 when they have learned it never has a
00:03:54 problem saying the letter m nobody
00:03:57 says the letter m wrong They are
00:04:00 specific letters in the case of Spanish there is
00:04:04 the letter s  yes As some children
00:04:07 who pronounce it s pronounce all the
00:04:10 feces like Z no this also happens in
00:04:14 other languages ​​it happens in English it happens
00:04:18 here in Thailand with Thai
00:04:20 there are also Thai people who
00:04:23 pronounce it like this because yes just like whistling
00:04:26 is difficult
00:04:28 there are many  people who do not know how to whistle
00:04:31 because the s is a type of whistle it is
00:04:36 similar to the whistle you have to
00:04:39 specifically find the position  n of the language
00:04:43 for that to sound and
00:04:46 some children find it difficult for some children
00:04:49 and they find it easier to make
00:04:52 the sound Z no and they get used to
00:04:56 doing it like this some later
00:04:59 learn to do it well but others do not get
00:05:03 used to it it becomes  a
00:05:05 habit adults understand them when they say
00:05:08 I'm going home well they do understand them So
00:05:11 they don't change and keep saying it
00:05:14 this way and at this moment it is
00:05:17 when children need a speech therapist we
00:05:20 have to take them to a speech therapist If
00:05:23 we want them to say it  they pronounce it correctly,
00:05:26 not that they pronounce it like that of
00:05:29 people What happens that adults do
00:05:33 something completely different adults
00:05:36 when they learn a language when they
00:05:39 study the pronunciation or when
00:05:42 someone teaches them the pronunciation they teach them by
00:05:45 explaining to them Well, where do
00:05:48 they have to put the language that they have to  to do
00:05:51 with the tongue when to breathe out or not
00:05:54 to breathe out when to do what to
00:05:58 do B instead of doing p no and they even
00:06:01 teach them the v  ocales the vowels a and
00:06:06 i or u that children never
00:06:10 ever have problems with vowels in their lives and
00:06:13 yes, a whole series of things with
00:06:17 which children have no problem
00:06:20 teaching the
00:06:22 ñ the letter ñ the difference between the
00:06:25 strong r and the non-r  lazy r How to do
00:06:29 the J also the natives never have
00:06:32 problems with saying the j and
00:06:35 a whole series of things with which
00:06:39 you will not have problems if you follow our
00:06:42 advice if you follow the advice of
00:06:45 our method the way we
00:06:48 recommend that you learn the language that I
00:06:52 already like  I have explained to you in many other
00:06:55 videos the trick is to listen a lot the
00:06:59 trick is to listen listen listen
00:07:01 until you are very clear in your head
00:07:06 how the language sounds how it has
00:07:09 to sound when Spanish already sounds you can
00:07:12 hear it very clearly in your head
00:07:14 and when you start  to speak at first
00:07:19 the sound that will come out of your mouth
00:07:23 is not exactly the same as what sounds in
00:07:26 your head but with a little
00:07:29 practice with really few hours  With
00:07:32 practice the two sounds are going to get
00:07:35 closer the sound that comes out of your
00:07:38 mouth is going to quickly get closer to the one you
00:07:43 hear in your head and then
00:07:48 once you have the clear idea in your
00:07:51 head
00:07:52 you have practiced a bit then if
00:07:56 you still have problems then
00:07:59 yes you can seek help you can ask for
00:08:03 help from a speech therapist or I don't know a speech therapist
00:08:07 for adults I don't know if they are called a coach or
00:08:11 something like that but hey Look for a
00:08:14 specialist a person who knows how to
00:08:16 say or help you do exercises or
00:08:20 whatever to pronounce  Especially not the
00:08:23 letter r, which is the one that many
00:08:27 foreigners have the most problems with
00:08:29 because if from the beginning you try to study
00:08:34 the pronunciation or ask for help to
00:08:37 learn how to say the r, the problem is not
00:08:40 going to be that you don't know how to do the r. The
00:08:44 problem is  that you will know how to do
00:08:47 But when you use it in practice it
00:08:51 will sound a bit strange because you don't see it
00:08:55 heard much and it sounds forced
00:08:58 like I don't know different from the way
00:09:02 the others say it  Spaniards no or
00:09:05 Spanish speakers from other
00:09:07 Spanish speaking countries So yes up to here
00:09:10 the destruction of the myth that children
00:09:14 also need help with
00:09:17 pronunciation and that for this reason adults
00:09:20 should also study
00:09:22 pronunciation okay come see you later and
00:09:28 if you want to know the best way  to
00:09:32 improve your Spanish Look

00:09:40 how to improve at each level and how to use

00:00:39 happened to me my story
00:00:43 and my story
00:00:46 me in 2014 in 2014
00:00:52 i was traveling i was traveling i was
00:00:59 touring mexico i came from japan i came from
00:01:06 living in japan i came from japan from japan i
00:01:10 went to the usa
00:01:13 I went to California because I
00:01:17 had friends in California I had friends in California
00:01:21 and then I went from California to Mexico I went
00:01:27 to Mexico
00:01:28 and in Mexico I had appendicitis I had
00:01:32 appendicitis I got sick I got sick
00:01:36 it
00:01:38 hurt my belly hurt it hurt from
00:01:42 appendicitis no and I went to the  hospital in the
00:01:47 hospital they removed my appendix they
00:01:51 removed my appendix
00:01:54 and then I was in the hospital I was
00:02:00 in the hospital for a few days and my mother
00:02:04 came my mother came from Spain she came to
00:02:08 see me yes yes and then we went  We went to a
00:02:13 hotel after the hospital we took a
00:02:18 room in a hotel and we stayed
00:02:21 several days in a room
00:02:25 in a hotel bed
00:02:29 and I had a lot of time to think I
00:02:33 was thinking a lot
00:02:36 and one night one night I was in bed
00:02:41 thinking
00:02:43 and  i was a little a little
00:02:48 stressed a little stressed
00:02:51 because sometimes i make an effort i
00:02:57 push myself i say come come
00:03:00 come pablo come work work
00:03:03 faster smarter come and
00:03:09 and this day i was a little stressed
00:03:14 and then after thinking
00:03:19 i realized  I realized and I realized
00:03:23 and I am not perfect of course but I
00:03:31 cannot for me it is impossible to be perfect
00:03:36 I only know what I only know
00:03:41 because before I have learned it during my
00:03:45 life then I have learned it and
00:03:48 each time it is done more and more and  more but if now
00:03:54 yes now there is something that I don't know it's not
00:03:59 my fault it's not mine my fault it's not my fault
00:04:03 for not knowing it
00:04:05 simply still now I
00:04:08 haven't reached that level yet I don't
00:04:12 know and  this day in bed at night in
00:04:17 mexico in DF not in mexico city
00:04:20 in a hotel room
00:04:23 this day i forgave myself i forgave
00:04:27 myself i forgave myself for not being perfect for
00:04:32 not doing everything perfectly i
00:04:36 told myself pablo
00:04:39 I forgive you I forgive you yes and this day
00:04:44 after forgiving myself I started
00:04:48 to cry
00:04:49 yes yes I started to cry it was a little weird
00:04:53 a little weird but yes I did start to cry
00:04:57 and also I wasn't stressed anymore I wasn't stressed anymore
00:05:04 but it wasn't just forgiving myself
00:05:08 forgive myself instead I thought
00:05:13 there are two people there are two people in my
00:05:19 life two people from my
00:05:23 past who are not I have not forgiven two
00:05:26 people I don't like I don't
00:05:30 like two people I'm
00:05:34 angry with I was angry with two
00:05:38 people from my past no
00:05:42 and I thought if I can
00:05:46 forgive myself forgive myself I
00:05:50 can also forgive these two these two
00:05:54 people yes and these these two people
00:05:59 with whom I was angry
00:06:04 I wanted to forgive them  because when
00:06:08 I remembered when I thought about these
00:06:11 two people I got angry I got angry
00:06:16 I felt and I felt bad I felt
00:06:22 stressed and angry and I don't like
00:06:27 it I don't like feeling
00:06:30 angry so I thought if I can
00:06:35 forgive myself I can also
00:06:38 forgive  these two people
00:06:43 these two people one person is my ex
00:06:47 girlfriend when i was in japan
00:06:52 i had several several girlfriends
00:06:55 but the first one a girl i
00:06:59 was with in japan
00:07:02 we ended badly the relationship ended badly
00:07:07 and i was angry with her
00:07:11 this is a person  the second person
00:07:14 is a housemate I
00:07:18 lived in soap in a house in a big house
00:07:22 we were six people we were six
00:07:27 well we went more because some people
00:07:30 were changing
00:07:33 but there was one person a
00:07:37 housemate in the house in japan with whom with
00:07:41 him  why did
00:07:43 we get angry I think he got
00:07:48 angry too and I got angry too
00:07:51 and these two people my ex and my ex
00:07:56 housemate both of them both of them well
00:08:01 it's still still there  I was angry with
00:08:05 both of them
00:08:07 so I tried and tried to
00:08:10 forgive them I tried to forgive
00:08:14 first one person first and then the other
00:08:17 person
00:08:19 and I managed to forgive them I thought
00:08:24 okay this person is the same as
00:08:28 me is not perfect and I imagined I
00:08:33 imagined if I were them  If I
00:08:37 were in their situation, if I were from
00:08:42 their country, if I had grown up, I would have
00:08:46 grown up just like them,
00:08:49 if I thought the same as them, it
00:08:56 would happen to me, I could do the
00:09:00 same as they did,
00:09:03 maybe I could do
00:09:06 I could I managed I could change
00:09:10 put myself in their body put myself in their
00:09:14 situation
00:09:16 and imagine imagine what they
00:09:20 were thinking and at that moment at that
00:09:25 moment it was very easy to forgive them it was
00:09:29 easy to forgive them and realize that
00:09:33 surely surely 70 percent
00:09:38 surely they are not bad people
00:09:43 they too in their life  in their own
00:09:47 life they have had bad experiences
00:09:51 are not perfect and manage to
00:09:56 forgive a person first and then  then
00:09:59 the other the other person and the truth is
00:10:03 that now when I remember
00:10:06 when I think about them now I'm
00:10:10 not angry I don't get stressed I'm much
00:10:15 calmer and it helped me I think that it
00:10:19 helped me in my life to feel better and
00:10:24 surely  in the future it would also be
00:10:28 good to forgive other people
00:10:32 and forgive myself more more times
00:10:35 surely it is a very very good thing
00:10:38 for my head for my state
00:10:44 for my psychology not that it is something
00:10:47 good
00:10:48 and you tell me tell me
00:10:53 below in the comments  if you
00:10:55 have managed to forgive
00:10:59 someone or not if there is someone with
00:11:04 whom you are still angry and
00:11:08 you have not forgiven them or you do not want to
00:11:11 do not want to forgive them because I think
00:11:16 it is quite normal it is normal not to
00:11:20 want to I do not want to forgive  that
00:11:23 person does not
00:11:25 come bye bye

098,"00:00:00 This is my cousin Judith and Judith is going
00:00:05 to explain a very interesting trip that she
00:00:07 took to where to Morocco,
00:00:11 very well, well, I want you to
00:00:14 explain everything to me
00:00:17 [Music]
00:00:20 or help her now, Pablo, who is fine,
00:00:25 because now, where are you in
00:00:28 Spain?  Barcelona and today you are going to tell us about
00:00:34 a trip you made to
00:00:36 Morocco
00:00:38 because for people who don't know where
00:00:41 Morocco was, Marrakech is in
00:00:44 Africa, in North Africa, just as it
00:00:46 is in North Africa, it is very
00:00:48 close to Spain if separated from it.  A
00:00:51 few kilometers and there are not only a few
00:00:53 kilometers of sea but from Spain you can
00:00:56 see that of Morocco
00:00:59 so explain to me why I think it has
00:01:02 been several times to Morocco
00:01:05 if now I could not say if I have gone three
00:01:08 or four two three or four times
00:01:13 okay
00:01:16 but yes  It has given me time to see
00:01:18 quite a few. You have seen quite a few things in
00:01:20 Morocco.
00:01:21 Explain to me the first time you went,
00:01:23 why did you go to Morocco
00:01:26 because I am a social
00:01:29 worker?
00:01:32 so at university you
00:01:34 study this social work and what does
00:01:38 a social worker do what is his job
00:01:41 is a complicated question it is difficult
00:01:46 specifically what I am
00:01:48 working on now that is in the aspect of
00:01:50 immigration what we do is if what we
00:01:54 do is welcome  to people who
00:01:57 arrive from different countries
00:01:58 bolt and we try to help them at the point
00:02:02 in their life where they just arrive in this
00:02:04 case to spain to barcelona in a
00:02:06 social worker more generally
00:02:09 helps people who have problems
00:02:11 integrating into society to become
00:02:13 members  of exact society, either
00:02:17 because they are in a place that is not
00:02:20 their country, or because they are older and
00:02:23 need
00:02:25 help of some kind, or because they
00:02:27 have a disability, it is okay, because
00:02:30 perhaps they have a wheelchair or they
00:02:32 have, then, because your  I work because
00:02:37 I'm taking you to go to Morocco
00:02:40 because I wanted to learn to
00:02:43 speak Arabic
00:02:44 you were we are learning at the same time yes
00:02:48 I signed up to study  to the
00:02:50 official language school of barcelona yes it
00:02:53 is a school it is a public school in
00:02:55 spain they teach languages ​​which is very cheap
00:02:58 yes it is very cheap yes yes but it is very
00:03:01 difficult to enter because many people want to
00:03:03 learn
00:03:04 exactly there is a lottery to enter and you
00:03:09 don't know  Yes, and then, well, I signed
00:03:13 up for English, French, and Arabic, but the
00:03:17 English lottery of the organization is
00:03:20 worth it, so only Ces and
00:03:23 Arabic were in French, and at the same time, well, look, it's
00:03:26 quite accurate, so it was going well
00:03:29 for me because many people who come to
00:03:31 spain are they are people from africa who
00:03:35 speak either arabic or french but
00:03:39 because there is something that interested me there are
00:03:41 many countries in africa where exact french is spoken
00:03:43 morocco senegal a lot like that and
00:03:49 well it interested me a lot and then i
00:03:51 decided i wanted to practice in another
00:03:53 way  That it wasn't studying, it's okay and
00:03:56 I decided to go to Morocco
00:03:59 and the first time I went I
00:04:04 went to find out if in the future I
00:04:06 'd like to live somewhere.
00:04:08 to see
00:04:11 what it was like and to decide if in the future
00:04:14 you could go to live you could stay there for a
00:04:16 while a year
00:04:19 and this is worth it very well if I saw many places
00:04:26 and made a trip of 15 days it is worth two
00:04:30 weeks fifteen days and two weeks and I went
00:04:34 Traveling along the entire coast, okay,
00:04:38 and you didn't go, you didn't go inland, no,
00:04:41 because in the interior, yes, in the
00:04:44 interior there are very beautiful places like
00:04:46 Marrakech or the Hexa, the desert
00:04:49 is also very beautiful, exactly, it never helps the
00:04:51 desert, but the coast is also
00:04:54 too  in very beautiful
00:04:56 places yes there are very very beautiful places I was
00:04:58 very surprised yes because I
00:05:01 expected another type of landscape and I was
00:05:04 very surprised because I saw a lot of
00:05:06 vegetation that I did not expect I liked it
00:05:11 and well I was there no I never stayed
00:05:14 in a hotel  No,
00:05:17 no one is here today because they don't have money,
00:05:21 so what I did was talk to
00:05:24 people from Morocco on the internet to
00:05:27 see, so those people welcomed me
00:05:29 into their home before going to Morocco.
00:05:31 ernet yes
00:05:33 using couchsurfing or as yes exactly it's
00:05:37 okay because I've used it too I've used
00:05:39 causar fin before
00:05:42 because it worked very well for me because with
00:05:45 mobility very interesting people well
00:05:48 however the truth is that most
00:05:50 people are very welcoming and whenever you
00:05:52 go there they do  You see and I see I found it is the
00:05:56 same also very well you like it good
00:05:58 experience yes yes yes very good very good
00:06:02 and good above all I made a lot of friends
00:06:04 with a family they
00:06:07 had three children it was the husband the wife
00:06:10 and three children exactly the eldest daughter was
00:06:14 afraid
00:06:17 [  Laughter]
00:06:21 At that time I don't remember I was
00:06:23 20, 23 or 24 I don't remember
00:06:30 the youngest daughter was two years younger because she
00:06:34 would have been 21 more or less or 20 and the
00:06:37 youngest son was 15 years old and it was a
00:06:41 very, very big house but then  Since they were
00:06:43 a similar age to yours, it was as if they
00:06:46 were your brothers.
00:06:48 They told me they were my brothers.
00:07:01 A similar way
00:07:04 in some languages ​​happens that people
00:07:07 of more or less your age call him
00:07:08 brother older brother little brother
00:07:11 I don't know well because of course I really had
00:07:14 relationships with people my age I only had
00:07:16 to return because later I
00:07:19 related  always with
00:07:22 older people people my age only knew them
00:07:25 so I don't know and since they
00:07:28 liked Spanish a lot
00:07:31 well they said many words to me in Spanish so
00:07:34 they were learning Spanish yes
00:07:37 yes yes I think that in Morocco there is enough
00:07:41 interest for  learn by changing yes
00:07:43 also a lot of people who watch my
00:07:46 videos who watch dream in spanish are
00:07:48 from morocco and yes yes well yes a lot
00:07:52 of people in fact when people found out that
00:07:54 i was spanish many spoke to me in
00:07:56 spanish it will be that they speak with the
00:07:59 most  so but yes very sexy ok so
00:08:01 you couldn't learn arabic ok
00:08:05 well more or less if you were lucky
00:08:07 that both the father and the mother of the
00:08:11 family were teachers in mar  Spinning wheels to
00:08:13 come back and then well, with each one of
00:08:17 the family I spoke a different language
00:08:19 with each person you spoke a language it was
00:08:22 very complicated
00:08:23 that you spoke with the little brother
00:08:25 maybe he didn't speak Spanish yet not the
00:08:28 little brother only spoke to me in Arabic he
00:08:31 didn't speak French either yes but  I don't know
00:08:35 about me, I think of course when I arrived
00:08:37 I explained to them that I wanted to learn to
00:08:40 speak Arabic and so he spoke to me
00:08:45 yes yes yes
00:08:48 the parents also always spoke to me in
00:08:51 Arabic but the mother when I
00:08:55 did not understand something told me in  French,
00:08:58 not the father because in reality it was
00:09:05 what was helping me because I
00:09:07 needed to have all the time as much
00:09:11 time as possible speaking in Arabic I
00:09:13 also prefer before telling it to me in
00:09:15 another language I prefer that they explain it to me
00:09:17 in the same language not words and that is
00:09:21 what they did
00:09:22 with the daughters with the one my
00:09:25 age spoke in French and with the
00:09:29 middle daughter spoke in English in English she
00:09:33 is 11 decades old
00:09:35 and of course when I left  I went to sleep my head hurt a
00:09:38 lot because I was
00:09:42 thinking about other languages ​​all day and the Arabic
00:09:46 that I had studied in Spain was the
00:09:49 same as they speak in Morocco it is not
00:09:53 even the same as us not one in
00:09:56 fact of course I knew very little well I
00:09:58 knew what  enough to survive
00:10:02 to communicate the basics to eat
00:10:06 to eat in the exact bathroom and
00:10:10 then I thought that this
00:10:13 would work for me but when I spoke
00:10:17 in the Arabic that I had studied,
00:10:19 everyone laughed at me
00:10:23 because the Arabic that they  He studies that it's
00:10:25 called Fosca, it's classical Arabic,
00:10:30 what is Arabic, since the one in which
00:10:34 the television news is broadcast
00:10:36 [Music]
00:10:37 is the Arabic of the Koran, too,
00:10:41 although the Koran is a little bit different
00:10:44 from the one I studied because my teacher
00:10:46 told us  If you go, you arrive in Morocco with
00:10:50 whom you are explaining, they will laugh at
00:10:53 you, but not as if I explained to you the
00:10:55 Arabic of the Qur'an, because then
00:10:57 more of the classic is done in the Qur'an,
00:11:01 okay and now and see it  modern standard version
00:11:03 of the act based on the quran but
00:11:07 not exactly accurate is like
00:11:10 lighter to study
00:11:13 but that is not spoken is not the language
00:11:15 the spoken language of any country
00:11:18 the news is not really used in
00:11:23 written arabic when yes exact in which
00:11:28 It's studied at school, that's also it,
00:11:30 but of course nobody speaks it on the street
00:11:33 where I am, well, if it's white Spanish
00:11:38 with a paper goal and speaking classical Arabic of
00:11:42 course, everyone laughed at
00:11:44 me so when I arrived, in fact, the
00:11:47 first thing I said when  I got home
00:11:50 I found the little brother
00:11:53 first and I said hello I'm looking for
00:11:57 Dunia who is the older sister and with
00:11:59 that she laughed in my face
00:12:01 [Laughter]
00:12:04 look look until she talks like the ones on
00:12:08 TV
00:12:12 and
00:12:13 and well of course there  I learned Moroccan Arabic
00:12:18 in quotes Boston I learned a lot
00:12:21 if now I don't remember so much because
00:12:25 the truth is I haven't been practicing it but
00:12:28 there I could hold
00:12:29 conversations without any problems
00:12:32 it could really be the  day by day to go
00:12:35 buy bread
00:12:37 if I was going to buy yes yes I also eat
00:12:41 there yes yes there is something they don't see that you
00:12:43 are understanding well I want to explain
00:12:46 more slowly I mean they have no
00:12:47 problem spending time with you
00:12:50 explaining whatever it is
00:12:54 that is  very good it is very good to
00:12:56 learn languages
00:12:58 because in some countries they are no more they are
00:13:00 more impatient no there no I there I was
00:13:04 very surprised
00:13:09 how relaxed people are
00:13:12 if you are going to buy you are going to buy there is no
00:13:14 rush to buy it is not like in
00:13:17 barcelona if you are going to buy but
00:13:19 you have 10 minutes because then you have or
00:13:21 are thinking
00:13:24 there you are not going to buy and then if there is
00:13:28 time and hours something else they
00:13:31 live in a more relaxed way maybe they are
00:13:33 happier
00:13:37 very good and if then after these
00:13:41 15 days
00:13:42 you decided that you were going to try to go live
00:13:44 in morocco
00:13:46 and in fact after these 15 days
00:13:50 after a week
00:13:52 I went to lebanon because i wanted to decide to
00:13:57 go live in morocco or lebanon is fine
00:14:01 because lebanon is another  a place where they
00:14:03 also speak
00:14:06 different Arabic the factor another type of Arabic
00:14:09 lara and it cost me much more much
00:14:14 because the people are more different it is
00:14:17 further from the standard Arabic of the truth
00:14:21 what did you study I couldn't tell you I
00:14:23 think I don't think it's more similar but
00:14:27 After spending 15 days
00:14:30 all the time speaking Moroccan Arabic,
00:14:33 it was very difficult for me to make the change
00:14:38 because my hand, Lebanon also
00:14:40 speaks French, so they speak French too, a
00:14:43 lot, a lot, in fact, it is a language that is
00:14:47 also known in itself, official, yes or yes,
00:14:52 and of course, everyone  everyone spoke French to me
00:14:54 yes directly yes perhaps perhaps in
00:14:58 lebanon they are more accustomed to
00:14:59 foreigners yes a lot and the most practical thing is
00:15:02 not to go directly afterwards French and even less
00:15:05 if I was also in a place that is
00:15:10 very university and then
00:15:13 everyone there  speak french the
00:15:14 university is in french a
00:15:17 lot of young people yes yes but i didn't like it that
00:15:22 much i decided i liked morocco more
00:15:26 because my goal in lebanon was not going to
00:15:29 happen  mplify I wasn't going to learn Arabic there
00:15:31 but it's going to be much more difficult if it's
00:15:33 clear
00:15:33 exactly so I was in Lebanon very
00:15:37 little I think I was a week
00:15:41 then I came back and after a month or two
00:15:46 months I don't remember much I went back to
00:15:50 Morocco
00:15:51 with  a friend of mine already with the intention of
00:15:54 staying and living there no not yet
00:15:58 a friend of mine wanted to go visit
00:16:01 morocco and she asked me if she could go with
00:16:03 her
00:16:06 and so i took her to the places she
00:16:08 had already been and you tried to go to
00:16:11 new places to  see new things
00:16:15 my friend had never been to morocco
00:16:18 and she was a bit insecure
00:16:22 because she knew nothing of arabic or
00:16:25 french and she is afraid of not understanding herself
00:16:28 so she simply already knew the
00:16:31 places she wanted to go she had looked at it
00:16:34 and it was just the  places where I had
00:16:37 gone okay but since I liked it so much I didn't
00:16:41 mind
00:16:45 and I didn't want to go to
00:16:50 Marrakech fez meknes or uarzazate if we went
00:16:54 call yes you went that's right
00:16:59 but then we went to the coast
00:17:04 you went to essaouira yes it will be heard
00:17:09 I loved it I was very young I was
00:17:12 in Morocco and I loved essaouira yes
00:17:14 I loved it too in fact there
00:17:18 when we went with my friend we stayed in
00:17:21 a hostel
00:17:25 because now I repeat the previous trip
00:17:29 the first trip I went to essaouira too
00:17:32 and of course  I knew nobody there
00:17:37 I left my bags it was a hostel to
00:17:40 stay because in uarzazate you didn't have a
00:17:43 you didn't know anyone for causing an end in
00:17:47 essaouira sorry
00:17:48 about that yes I didn't see that way to lose unless
00:17:50 boarding the fort acquaintances no I
00:17:52 hadn't met anyone no  no no but they
00:17:55 told me
00:17:57 the first night I arrived in morocco
00:17:59 they told me you have to go there and then
00:18:02 I went to where they told me to return and
00:18:05 then I went to the you left the suitcases in
00:18:08 a hostel and then I went for a walk and
00:18:12 walking I found a  some guys and they
00:18:16 told me nothing we're going to go to the beach
00:18:20 and then we have a music group
00:18:22 we play in a bar
00:18:24 if you want to come so I went with them
00:18:27 all day and at night it was the day
00:18:31 before Ramadan started
00:18:34 and then at night they already made like
00:18:38 a party we prepared all the food at their
00:18:41 house and we were there having dinner and
00:18:44 then they told me if you want to stay
00:18:46 here stay and tomorrow you'll leave because
00:18:49 I don't know I remember it was one or
00:18:51 two o'clock  In the morning, yes, it was a bit
00:18:53 dangerous to go to the hostel, to go out,
00:18:58 exactly, so in that escape to a
00:19:01 hostel, but I didn't say
00:19:04 oysters, I didn't even leave the
00:19:07 suitcases.
00:19:15 In the same booth with my friend,
00:19:18 well, the guy from the hostel remembered
00:19:21 me and gave me the night because he told me
00:19:25 that the other time I went and I
00:19:27 hadn't slept there, so he didn't want to charge me. He
00:19:34 also spoke Spanish very well, I
00:19:37 had studied.  Spanish he
00:19:39 also spoke German
00:19:42 and just now he has opened a hostel
00:19:44 because he worked there but it wasn't
00:19:47 his he
00:19:48 has his own and I'm sure he's doing very
00:19:53 well in that life too yes also well
00:19:57 yes I think now he  The next time you
00:19:59 go, you're going to be scared if he's so kind
00:20:01 to everyone, because he'll surely
00:20:03 have many repeat clients, it
00:20:05 's safe because he remembered
00:20:08 me, I didn't even stay to sleep
00:20:10 alone,
00:20:17 very empathetic, I came back and then that was the
00:20:21 second time.  And the third time I already went to
00:20:24 stay the third time the third trip to
00:20:26 Morocco not to Morocco and later
00:20:30 it was also a month later it was in
00:20:33 October to fly in October 2016 if I
00:20:37 remember correctly I
00:20:40 flew three years ago yes
00:20:43 time will pass quickly  so the third
00:20:46 time you already went with the idea of ​​staying
00:20:48 there to live for an exact time yes
00:20:52 then I found an NGO of an NGO that
00:20:58 is a non-profit non
00:21:04 -profit association that tries to
00:21:06 help people
00:21:08 -exactly then this NGO what  I was doing
00:21:14 and helping with training for young people in
00:21:17 a Moroccan neighborhood in
00:21:19 a Marrakech neighborhood
00:21:23 in Marrakech there are different areas in
00:21:25 different neighborhoods and in a neighborhood they
00:21:29 do training towards education.  but
00:21:32 education to learn to do a
00:21:34 job or so that it was not a
00:21:38 more general type of education taught in English
00:21:42 from the most basic
00:21:45 levels to higher levels
00:21:47 and then they
00:21:49 did training to be able to
00:21:52 change jobs, that is,
00:21:54 people from all over the neighborhood came  They
00:21:57 worked, for example, as workers and
00:22:01 they were taught
00:22:04 to be able to move up a category or to be
00:22:06 able to change jobs, but it was not an
00:22:08 education that they did the
00:22:12 same thing throughout the year, but they gave education on time, it
00:22:16 was very punctual for a very specific thing,
00:22:21 quite directed, well,  to be able to do an
00:22:23 exact exact job but since it was a
00:22:27 very large neighborhood every day they did something
00:22:30 different there were a lot of people who went to
00:22:32 this place ok so you lived in
00:22:35 marrakech yes yes yes I lived in the same
00:22:38 neighborhood
00:22:40 and well what I did was that  I helped
00:22:46 the director of the NGO to organize the
00:22:48 courses and I taught English to the
00:22:52 little ones, ok, you taught English yourself,
00:22:54 yes, and the director to the person  Join the
00:22:58 boss the person who runs the entire
00:23:00 organization the NGO will help you
00:23:03 plan the different courses yes yes
00:23:07 yes it's okay and since there were many
00:23:10 volunteers in this NGO what I
00:23:13 also did was coordinate all the
00:23:15 volunteers organize when they had to
00:23:17 come  What did they have to do? That
00:23:20 is what my main task was. Okay,
00:23:22 the volunteers, who are the people who are going
00:23:24 to help work without charging exact money.
00:23:27 Well, you communicate with them. I would notify them
00:23:30 when there was something.
00:23:34 What was
00:23:37 the majority of the time that I
00:23:40 was there I talked to the volunteers
00:23:43 that there were enough and how long
00:23:46 you were there because I don't remember very
00:23:49 well yes I was a month and a half or two
00:23:51 months
00:23:53 my idea was to stay a year in the same
00:23:59 place working in  the same or in the
00:24:01 same place
00:24:03 but what happened
00:24:05 but I was living with the family
00:24:09 that I had met on the first trip
00:24:12 who welcomed me as if I were their daughter
00:24:16 the first family the  Of the three sons,
00:24:18 not exactly, two daughters and my exact son,
00:24:22 then the parents told me that I
00:24:24 was like their daughter that I could stay as
00:24:26 long as she needed, although
00:24:29 you didn't have to look for a flat or
00:24:31 pay rent, exactly, nothing, but
00:24:35 they didn't want to either.  That I gave them
00:24:37 money is okay so they didn't want me to
00:24:41 pay anything and you
00:24:45 wanted to give them money and I wanted to give them money because I
00:24:47 was spending money there they were
00:24:50 eating water
00:24:53 [Music]
00:24:55 and then I felt bad
00:24:59 and I talked to the head of  the NGO with the
00:25:02 man who ran the entire organization and
00:25:07 I explained to him that I could only stay
00:25:11 if he was looking for a place for me to
00:25:16 live.
00:25:20 Exactly.
00:25:35 when you went there that was that was
00:25:38 the plan they told you that they would give you
00:25:39 a place to live if it's yours
00:25:43 you thought it would be like that exactly but
00:25:46 it took a long time they told me the
00:25:49 first week I'll have  You will have a place to
00:25:52 live and the first week no no the
00:25:55 second week you won't have a place to
00:25:57 live either but there was someone there was
00:26:00 someone looking for a flat for you
00:26:03 I don't know but I think not
00:26:08 so when I finally left I
00:26:13 explained to the boss that I didn't  I could continue
00:26:17 living with this family because I
00:26:20 felt bad because they wouldn't let me leave
00:26:23 them money
00:26:26 so of course I wasn't comfortable
00:26:31 and when I left I left money on the
00:26:35 nightstand next to the bed and I
00:26:40 left them all the money I  I thought I
00:26:42 had spent
00:26:44 because of course it
00:26:47 was fair to me but I got
00:26:50 very angry if they thought they
00:26:53 were being kind to you, no, and
00:26:55 for them perhaps receiving money was a
00:26:58 bit like an exact offense they
00:27:01 will always make it clear but
00:27:03 I understand it too  Well, we are
00:27:04 from the same culture and maybe if it is a
00:27:06 difference between the sexes and if there is a
00:27:10 very big difference
00:27:12 and then when
00:27:16 they saw that I had left
00:27:17 money for the mother they called me.  She loved very angry
00:27:23 and told me that since I had dared
00:27:27 to leave them money that I am a daughter
00:27:30 to her and that her daughter would never have done
00:27:33 that, it had offended her a lot,
00:27:36 so her eldest daughter, the one who was my
00:27:41 age, came to the airport to  look for me others
00:27:46 to take me home to other sports
00:27:48 yes yes before I left he came to the
00:27:51 airport to pick me up he picked me up he
00:27:54 took me home he gave me the money
00:27:57 he told me that what I
00:28:00 had done was not good I said goodbye to everyone again
00:28:03 and went with  My money seriously us
00:28:07 and you arrived on time for the flight yes because
00:28:11 I left with a lot of time
00:28:13 because how I am there so slow because
00:28:16 everyone is so calm I
00:28:18 always went if with a lot of time and I
00:28:22 asked them for forgiveness and many others and now to
00:28:30 continue being friends  because I have gone
00:28:34 again later now improved and last year
00:28:40 I went to see them again not
00:28:44 exactly four times and then I went to see them
00:28:50 again
00:28:51 and of course it is not clear at all and it did not
00:28:56 occur to me if I did go to see them and if we talked
00:29:00 on the phone  not many times these well if
00:29:04 it is very
00:29:06 I don't know it has touched me too it has touched me it has not
00:29:09 touched me enough when someone
00:29:10 has opened the doors of their house
00:29:12 as if I were part of the family if it
00:29:15 surprises a lot it is because I even
00:29:20 for  For example,
00:29:22 if I had a free room in my
00:29:25 house so that someone could stay,
00:29:29 I think it would be difficult for a person
00:29:33 I don't know to stay, but I was going to
00:29:35 stay with them for a year and they
00:29:37 said yes without paying anything, we'll be back for
00:29:40 a year.  The exact whole thing is that I didn't
00:29:44 even pay for food,
00:29:45 nothing, nothing, nothing clear to me, that seems
00:29:47 very surprising to me here in Spain,
00:29:51 it's not a general thing, and that's not
00:29:55 normal.
00:29:56 Well, we'll see maybe maybe we
00:29:58 too in the future if we have children,
00:30:02 no  We see another person the age of
00:30:05 our children who needs it, well,
00:30:06 let's see, maybe we'll do Alex in the cold,
00:30:08 yes, maybe because we've lived through it and because
00:30:11 we've received that treatment, but I think
00:30:14 that someone who hasn't seen it is that
00:30:17 I don't even think  For example, my parents found it
00:30:20 hard to believe
00:30:24 if they didn't understand if it's surprising well
00:30:29 yes yes yes it's a very nice experience
00:30:32 yes yes well thank you very much for telling
00:30:36 us at least about that experience and well I hope
00:30:40 you come more and help me record
00:30:43 more videos because  Of course, yes, it has been
00:30:46 interesting, that's how I remember it, I also
00:30:48 hadn't remembered the
00:30:50 trip for a long time. If you had to remember all
00:30:53 the experiences
00:30:55 very well, well, thank you very much, you're welcome and

00:00:04 [Laughter]
00:00:07 today I no longer don't know what we're going to talk
00:00:12 about people
00:00:15 the intention is not to talk
00:00:19 talk talk talk
00:00:23 and if we can talk about major festivals
00:00:30 [Laughter]
00:00:35 and Juan
00:00:38 [Music
00:00:43 ] came in last  Quit
00:00:45 it is said
00:00:48 hello hello well, the major festivals now it
00:00:55 is summer
00:00:58 that waits every hour it is not very hot
00:01:02 we are sweating
00:01:07 and
00:01:09 in summer there are many major festivals
00:01:14 in many places many places in Spain
00:01:19 I would say that all and God in all
00:01:22 towns yes major every half
00:01:26 Majorca and the Canary Islands have been forgotten, but it's less, it's
00:01:31 less important,
00:01:34 Majorca is not important, Menorca is very important -
00:01:37 and so and here it is
00:01:47 [Laughter]
00:01:51 On the cable there is also a local festival
00:01:55 [Laughter]
00:01:58 and well, especially sun in the summer
00:02:03 and in different places  It is on different
00:02:07 dates
00:02:09 during the summer not July August
00:02:12 September also June and also at the
00:02:16 end and June July August and
00:02:19 September
00:02:20 if these four months
00:02:24 are hotter there are many parties because when  or it's
00:02:27 hot you want to go outside now not now
00:02:36 but later when the sun
00:02:39 starts to go down and it's less hot
00:02:43 then why go to a party
00:02:48 and at major parties that you do
00:02:53 something that is done at the major
00:02:55 party the major party the  people go to dance
00:02:59 where the street in the street
00:03:04 in the squares of the towns in the street
00:03:09 perhaps less in the streets but above
00:03:11 all in the squares more the squares where
00:03:15 there are streets from street to street and here is
00:03:18 Nuria
00:03:22 Nuria alone
00:03:25 everyone is  think that she died
00:03:36 with men, she is yours
00:03:40 to keep with your lips for paternal
00:03:46 good but it is not only Nuria there
00:03:50 where many people
00:03:53 in the squares dancing because there is music
00:03:56 there is music
00:03:59 in the squares and what else is done at
00:04:03 festivals at festivals there is also
00:04:04 something going on  very typical of catalan who
00:04:07 are alliance is typical of here in
00:04:11 catalonia not and there the giants are a
00:04:16 giant is a very big person
00:04:21 and oh well I can draw a picture they are
00:04:24 usually kings queens and there may be I don't know a  a
00:04:28 queen
00:04:29 for a dressing room I don't know
00:04:34 and really inside there is a person in the
00:04:38 structure of the person and this is
00:04:41 not wood and they put it on their shoulders and
00:04:45 here on their shoulders and they carry it and dance
00:04:49 and giant dance dance there is music and they
00:04:52 dance
00:04:54 [Music]
00:05:08 At major parties we dance above all
00:05:11 we like to dance we don't dance much
00:05:15 we like to dance and the giants go down the
00:05:22 street they follow the street
00:05:28 and they go down the street they danced to the
00:05:31 music and there is also change to their are
00:05:35 big-headed big-headed is similar  but
00:05:39 smaller and there is a person and he is wearing a
00:05:44 costume he is wearing a suit and a
00:05:49 bigger head also a head here
00:05:51 with hair and eyes
00:05:54 yes yes
00:05:56 [Laughter]
00:06:00 and if this is a bighead no
00:06:04 bigheads are often worn by
00:06:05 children  There are children inside there are children, they are
00:06:09 small and the big-headed ones you, Mariona,
00:06:14 have worn a big-headed one and it has never been like that,
00:06:19 neither have I,
00:06:23 Mariona, I am the expert.
00:06:37 The ones taken to
00:06:41 finance don't weigh much 8 weigh weights and
00:06:45 they don't change the people who
00:06:47 carry it inside are changing paying that
00:06:49 much they change they take turns and because they get
00:06:52 tired easily
00:06:56 you have to be strong
00:06:59 we will make the value wear
00:07:09 very well and apart from  this in
00:07:14 major festivals is also the correfocs
00:07:17 but I have also made videos
00:07:20 before and I leave you the link
00:07:26 here or if not in the description below
00:07:32 at the information outlet he
00:07:36 has made videos about the correfocs very
00:07:39 well spoken and there are also human towers  where
00:07:43 we make human castles towers with
00:07:46 humans with people people people
00:07:48 is very impressive
00:07:51 and they also do a traditional dance dance
00:07:58 sorry but we don't know much about
00:08:02 the major festivals in the rest of
00:08:04 spain but we know above all what
00:08:08 the ones in catalonia are like here  and Catalonia
00:08:10 they do a dance, as it is called, it is
00:08:14 called sardana
00:08:17 [Music]
00:08:26 and what it consists of is a typical
00:08:29 Catalan dance where they dance corro cogi
00:08:32 two holding hands like this and you dance with your feet
00:08:35 doing a series of coordinated steps
00:08:37 not with your feet
00:08:42 with your feet you have to make some
00:08:44 movements and your hands
00:08:53 holding hands and there are a series of
00:08:56 steps where you dance in a circle you do
00:08:59 a circle not all of people make a
00:09:04 circle and all hold hands with people
00:09:09 and make a circle they exile everyone turns
00:09:13 here and there
00:09:16 except very well accompanies the sardana
00:09:20 we have the orchestra there is an orchestra
00:09:23 there are also musicians specifically it's
00:09:26 called copla'  the copla
00:09:29 how many musicians are many many and there is
00:09:33 a beautiful one that I think
00:09:37 [Laughter]
00:09:45 but there are musicians there are people who play
00:09:48 instruments they play they can play
00:09:50 wind music instruments for sure wind
00:09:54 [Laughter]
00:10:01 instruments in other
00:10:03 musical instruments like guitar and double bass
00:10:11 ready
00:10:17 with one hand  and the
00:10:24 exact music is copla and sardana goes together, you
00:10:28 can't dance a sardana with
00:10:30 reggaeton no no if there's sardana and
00:10:33 they play reggaeton
00:10:37 we don't like pitbulls
00:10:39 [Music]
00:10:48 and finally  At the one of the local festival it doesn't matter
00:10:53 where at the end of the local festival

007,"00:00:00 When I was 15 years old I made my first
00:00:03 trip to the United States
00:00:06 in this video I tell you how it was
00:00:12 [Music]
00:00:15 Well, when I was a teenager I really
00:00:20 liked learning English I had
00:00:24 an Australian conversation teacher,
00:00:28 a native teacher who came to my house
00:00:31 on weekends.  week and I could practice
00:00:35 English with him and one day my teacher
00:00:41 told my parents
00:00:44 he thought it was a good idea for me
00:00:49 to go do an English course
00:00:53 abroad in an English speaking country and
00:00:57 my parents asked me if I  I would be
00:01:00 interested in doing an
00:01:03 immersion course to go study in an
00:01:07 English-speaking country and I said yes I
00:01:11 was super excited and I loved
00:01:14 the idea so I decided to go do
00:01:19 a summer course in the US
00:01:23 my parents found a company
00:01:26 Spanish who organized
00:01:30 language courses abroad in different
00:01:34 countries
00:01:35 and I decided to go to the US because when I
00:01:41 was very young I was very interested in
00:01:44 culture because I had seen many
00:01:47 American movies  I liked American
00:01:51 music
00:01:51 and I wanted to go to the US so
00:01:56 I signed up for a course that took place
00:02:01 on the east coast in the state of
00:02:04 Pennsylvania and in this course there was a
00:02:09 group of students a group of students
00:02:12 from all over Spain  The
00:02:17 students of this course were Spanish
00:02:21 and so I went to Madrid that summer
00:02:25 there I met at the
00:02:27 Madrid airport- with the rest of the students of
00:02:31 this course and we flew together
00:02:34 to New York We flew from Madrid
00:02:37 to New York All the students
00:02:40 of the course  we were minors we
00:02:44 were not adults we were between
00:02:48 13 and 17 years old so
00:02:53 an adult monitor came with us an
00:02:56 adult companion at all times from
00:03:00 when we left spain until we arrived
00:03:03 in the usa and when we arrived in new york -
00:03:07 the flight arrived in new york well
00:03:09 we had to go to pennsylvania and
00:03:12 we went by bus to pennsylvania to
00:03:15 an area that was close to the city
00:03:20 of philadelphia
00:03:22 and there our families were waiting for us
00:03:26 every  The student had an American family
00:03:31 with whom he was going to stay, so
00:03:35 when we arrived in Pennsylvania I met
00:03:38 my family. It was a very normal family
00:03:41 with the father and the mother, they were both
00:03:46 physical therapists and they had two sons
00:03:50 and a daughter. The children were nine and
00:03:54 seven.  years old and the girl was three years old
00:03:58 so I met them there and they
00:04:02 took me to their house and I was very
00:04:05 happy it was a very nice house very
00:04:07 big very comfortable and I had my own
00:04:11 room and the next day we
00:04:16 started English classes at  Monday
00:04:20 to Friday the whole group of students
00:04:24 met in
00:04:27 a school and we all went to class
00:04:31 together they were English classes but they were not
00:04:36 traditional classes they were very fun
00:04:41 classes classes with
00:04:42 different activities and games but they
00:04:46 were not traditional classes to study
00:04:50 English study grammar we did
00:04:54 nothing  from that everything was very playful everything was
00:04:58 very
00:04:59 entertaining very fun and so I
00:05:02 went to class every day from Monday to
00:05:05 Friday from  9 in the morning to 12
00:05:09 noon and at 12 the classes
00:05:12 finished and the whole group of
00:05:15 students and we are going to do an
00:05:18 activity every day it was a
00:05:21 different activity because for example some days
00:05:25 we would go to the cinema
00:05:27 and go bowling or to the pool
00:05:31 we do a  pool party and it was
00:05:36 very very fun we had
00:05:41 a great time and once a week as students
00:05:45 we took a slightly longer
00:05:49 excursion so on these excursions we went to
00:05:53 visit new york we went to philadelphia
00:05:57 we went to washington dc
00:06:01 and if all  students, we
00:06:04 really wanted to, we were very excited
00:06:07 to see these cities because
00:06:11 we already knew these cities from the
00:06:15 movies and seeing them on television in the
00:06:18 series and the truth is that it was a
00:06:22 very interesting experience and
00:06:26 on weekends
00:06:26 we didn't have classes every weekend
00:06:30 student was with his family and
00:06:34 my family had a house on a lake a
00:06:39 vacation house on a lake or near
00:06:43 a lake and every weekend
00:06:46 we went to this house it was a very
00:06:49 big house so they always had
00:06:52 guests and they invited family they
00:06:56 invited friends and every weekend
00:06:59 there were different guests
00:07:04 at the lake house and well the lake
00:07:08 had a beach
00:07:10 so you could swim we could swim in
00:07:14 the  lake the family my family had a
00:07:17 little boat a small boat and we would go
00:07:20 sailing with the boat on the lake we also took
00:07:24 walks through the countryside and the
00:07:29 truth is that it was very beautiful the countryside
00:07:32 there was very beautiful very green and I
00:07:35 liked it a lot besides me  I spent the 4th of
00:07:39 July, the national holiday in the US, with
00:07:43 this family at the lake house and well,
00:07:47 they had a barbecue, there was a
00:07:50 community party
00:07:53 and I had a great time, but when I
00:07:56 was with the family on weekends,
00:07:59 sometimes I  It overwhelmed me a bit,
00:08:04 it stressed me out a bit because I didn't
00:08:09 have anyone else to speak Spanish with, I
00:08:12 had to speak English all the
00:08:15 time and that was sometimes a bit tiring,
00:08:20 especially because sometimes I don't know  I understood
00:08:24 the conversations that were going on around me,
00:08:29 the people, especially the
00:08:33 adults who were talking around
00:08:36 me, sometimes it was a little difficult for me to
00:08:40 understand
00:08:42 and that sometimes made me feel a little
00:08:45 overwhelmed, but the family also
00:08:49 paid a lot of attention to me, they
00:08:51 spent a lot of time  While talking to me, they
00:08:55 took me shopping and if I
00:09:00 could have conversations with them and they did
00:09:04 understand when they spoke to me
00:09:07 directly, in general, my trip to the USA
00:09:11 was a very positive experience.
00:09:16 My English didn't improve much.
00:09:19 I learned a little, but it wasn't a radical change.
00:09:23 I was only in the
00:09:27 US for a month but the experience was very
00:09:32 positive because I had to adapt to a
00:09:36 different culture
00:09:39 I met a lot of new people
00:09:42 I made a lot of friends I
00:09:44 visited a lot of interesting places
00:09:49 so when I came back to Spain I had a
00:09:51 lot of things to tell my parents
00:09:55 and my family  and I was very happy and
00:10:00 that was my experience in the US and have
00:10:05 you ever done a free
00:10:08 immersion course  ngüística in another country

235,"00:00:00 hello hello my name is cloud I am
00:00:02 Mexican and I am happy to be
00:00:04 with you again today I want to
00:00:07 talk about my favorite Mexican sweets
00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:18 the truth is that in Mexico we have
00:00:22 many sweets that are typical of each
00:00:25 region or each state we have for
00:00:28 example cocadas  the lemon stuffed with coconut
00:00:33 glories among others my favorite my
00:00:38 favorite traditional Mexican sweet is a
00:00:41 sweet that comes from the state of chihuahua
00:00:44 in the north of the country that consists of no
00:00:48 this channel with dulce de leche is
00:00:53 delicious the truth is that I got to know this
00:00:56 sweet thanks to  a friend who is from
00:00:59 Chihuahua and I loved it that is my
00:01:03 favorite Mexican sweet but in Mexico we have
00:01:08 other types of sweets that the difference
00:01:12 with the typical sweets that I just
00:01:14 mentioned
00:01:16 is that these sweets or candies are
00:01:21 processed, this does not mean that they are already
00:01:25 They have a process in which they may
00:01:28 use artificial flavors and
00:01:32 artificial colors,
00:01:34 but they are not natural, instead the
00:01:39 typical Mexican sweets  Like the ones I previously told you,
00:01:42 those are quite
00:01:45 natural and have a more traditional process.
00:01:48 Having said this, I want to share with you
00:01:53 the candies or
00:01:56 processed sweets that I loved since
00:02:00 I was little and to this day from
00:02:04 time to time because it is worth mentioning that they are
00:02:07 not  It is very healthy to eat this type of
00:02:11 candies frequently and to this
00:02:14 day I continue to consume them
00:02:17 so if we start ok the first one I
00:02:22 want to share with you is called tan son tan
00:02:25 son because if you look it has like a
00:02:30 tummy not a bit big then the
00:02:33 name of this  sweet is the bread they are let's
00:02:36 open it I loved it
00:02:39 because it has like it has this one it has
00:02:44 chamoy it has chamoy inside here and on top it
00:02:48 has a kind of
00:02:51 palette no so it's like chamoy palette
00:02:55 and it has a hole a hole where you
00:02:59 suck and you get the chamoy in
00:03:03 combination  with the lollipop so we are going
00:03:06 to open it
00:03:08 and I was able to open it
00:03:12 here we have here they are I bring them closer to the
00:03:15 camera this is a type of lollipop not
00:03:19 caramel  or and inside, I don't know if you
00:03:22 can see it, it has like a tube through
00:03:25 which the chamoy that is inside here passes,
00:03:29 so chamoy is a mixture of chili
00:03:33 with lemon. The natural chamoy is a
00:03:36 mixture of chili with lemon and other
00:03:39 ingredients that makes the
00:03:43 the chile becomes liquid
00:03:45 so the taste is a bit bittersweet
00:03:47 no because it has
00:03:50 because it is also combined with sugar
00:03:53 so it
00:03:55 has this sweet and sour touch of the sugar
00:03:59 with the chili with the lemon it is something
00:04:04 incredible
00:04:05 so this is the chamoy and how it is
00:04:09 eaten is like that no and  The caramel has
00:04:15 a watermelon flavor so it's very tasty, very tasty.
00:04:19 I have to say that most
00:04:23 Mexican candies have a watermelon flavor.
00:04:27 I think it's because it's a
00:04:31 very fresh fruit, very tasty, so yes, the
00:04:36 caramel comes in popsicles in a
00:04:41 yes or as in this type of presentation it
00:04:43 generally has a watermelon flavor the
00:04:47 second sweet or candy that I love
00:04:51 is this one because here is the bag and it's
00:04:56 called sprinters
00:04:59 these are this one it's called  ma get sauce and
00:05:02 then there are different types of
00:05:06 escuintles there are some that are filled
00:05:10 with chamoy but have a
00:05:13 tamarind flavor tamarind is a fruit
00:05:17 and if you look here we have
00:05:22 watermelon I didn't tell you that many
00:05:25 have a watermelon flavor then  This
00:05:29 presentation is called getty sauce, it's a
00:05:32 combination of the word sauce and
00:05:36 getty, like spaghetti, because if you look closely, it
00:05:39 's like a strip that's sweet,
00:05:45 so we can add chamoy to this sweet,
00:05:49 no, it's the lukas that's here,
00:05:53 lucas, his name is worm and he's  a kind of
00:05:57 sauce and you pour
00:06:01 it out you eat it it's not super super tasty I was
00:06:06 happy eating this in elementary school in
00:06:09 high school it's very very tasty but and if you
00:06:14 look here it has the chile william e
00:06:18 mancha here it has chili it's not very tasty
00:06:23 ok now  Another sweet that I love is the
00:06:29 bombazo bombazo
00:06:32 this sweet that tells us that it has
00:06:36 a lemon flavor is a lemon flavored sweet enchilado
00:06:40 with chewing gum
00:06:42 so inside we can
00:06:46 find there we can find  weird a
00:06:51 kind
00:06:53 of pasta like this a lemon flavored pasta
00:06:59 not with chili which is what it
00:07:02 mentions here and if we raise this is
00:07:06 our spoon
00:07:08 or the utensil with which we eat it so
00:07:14 very good and this is the chewing gum
00:07:19 then  You usually grab your pasta, you
00:07:23 eat it, and you also eat chewing
00:07:28 gum.
00:07:30 The bombazo is very good because it's called a
00:07:33 bombazo because it's like an explosion of
00:07:36 flavor. It's very rich and I could say
00:07:40 that this is my favorite.
00:07:46 I love it,
00:07:49 it's called Lucas grimaces so the name
00:07:53 comes from the fact that it's sour, it's not an
00:07:57 acidic sweet here it says
00:08:01 chamoy flavored lollipop with chili powder
00:08:05 so the name muecas comes from the fact
00:08:10 that when you eat it you make a face
00:08:14 so here we have chili  the
00:08:18 chili powder you have to be careful
00:08:20 because if you get to inhale or breathe
00:08:25 near the chili you can start coughing and
00:08:30 sneezing no
00:08:32 then yes and this is the palette
00:08:35 so how do we eat this sweet is that
00:08:40 I  We have the palette, we shake it
00:08:45 , our palette covered in chili comes out,
00:08:49 our palette covered in chili comes out
00:08:52 and we suck it.
00:09:12 lollipop
00:09:17 covered with chili and we continue like this until we
00:09:21 finish our lollipop and
00:09:25 finish the chili powder that is inside here.
00:09:28 The truth is that
00:09:31 I love that combination of an
00:09:36 element or a sweet food with a
00:09:41 little chili or with  a little bit of lemon
00:09:44 I think it's something very Mexican
00:09:49 but having this combination not of
00:09:52 sweet with chili or sweet and spicy
00:09:56 is something very Mexican
00:09:59 and I love it so
00:10:02 these are the sweets or candies that
00:10:07 I love
00:10:09 in Mexico you can't find this
00:10:12 anywhere  store there was no case there are not
00:10:15 many sexes
00:10:16 you can find it in any
00:10:19 oxxo store then or in the markets in the
00:10:23 markets it is also easy to find
00:10:26 these sweets
00:10:29 So that's all for today, thank you very much

00:01:24 is
00:01:26 258 kilometers away from the
00:01:30 capital of oaxaca
00:01:32 we are in the coastal zone the foundation
00:01:36 of puerto escondido the city has a
00:01:40 very interesting legend that has
00:01:44 to do with pirates since it is said that
00:01:48 a pirate named andre  w kidnapped a
00:01:52 young Mixtec woman so one day this young woman
00:01:57 ran away and took refuge in the
00:02:02 jungles and to the beach where she
00:02:05 also took refuge, she took care of herself, that is,
00:02:09 she hid, it was called the
00:02:12 hidden beach and today it is the right place
00:02:16 the name of the hidden port here on
00:02:19 that side we can see a monument to the
00:02:22 waves of zicatela on this beach we can
00:02:27 see a wave that is very big on this
00:02:30 beach and here a surfboard is a
00:02:34 very nice place to take a

00:02:43 walkway where you will be able to
00:02:46 find both hotels and
00:02:49 restaurants places to have an
00:02:53 alcoholic drink or a lemonade
00:02:56 and here is all the nightlife of
00:02:59 puerto escondido
00:03:01 [Music]

00:03:26 this place on this side there are some wings and
00:03:30 some stairs to sit there and  that
00:03:34 the photo looks great on this side
00:03:37 we can see a fountain which is very
00:03:43 funny and already on that side there are places
00:03:47 to have a little cold or a beer
00:03:51 that with that weather it's going to be craving what
00:03:56 you have is that when you drink beer in
00:03:59 the beach tastes like water because you feel that it
00:04:04 is very hot and that hydrates you
00:04:06 too much now we are in a
00:04:10 viewpoint here in zicatela go
00:04:12 up the stairs and we will be at the
00:04:15 top and we will be able to enjoy the
00:04:19 main bay and its beautiful views and
00:04:22 also all  Zicatela beach is a
00:04:26 very good place to come and enjoy,
00:04:30 relax and see very beautiful views here
00:04:34 in this viewpoint, which is where
00:04:37 the beach begins as such.
00:04:39 [Music]
00:04:53 Here we are at the top of this
00:04:56 viewpoint and how beautiful are the views
00:05:00 that  we can appreciate what we can have
00:05:04 here I am going to show you the view that
00:05:07 I have on my right side
00:05:10 we can see the Puerto Escondido beach
00:05:13 which is the main bay they were nothing more
00:05:16 than a beautiful view we can see there in the
00:05:18 background the l  wide that are the ones that
00:05:21 the tours give or that of the boats of the
00:05:25 fishermen of the people who fish in
00:05:28 the sea and on this side we can see
00:05:31 the Zicatela beach as such, which is 3
00:05:36 kilometers of beach and just see how
00:05:40 beautiful it can be  see all this area on
00:05:43 that side is the road where
00:05:45 the cobblestone begins and what a beautiful place we are at
00:05:49 the top and it looks incredible now it is
00:05:54 4 in the afternoon and the time has come
00:05:58 something is for this reason that I was walking
00:06:01 on this walker and I saw  a restaurant and it
00:06:06 smelled of fish since on the coast they
00:06:09 eat a lot of seafood or fish
00:06:12 and I was craving it and that's why between now
00:06:16 I'm already sitting here
00:06:18 under a palapa listening to good music
00:06:22 and watching the sea
00:06:25 watching the queues in the background and an excellent
00:06:29 stage let's go  to wait for
00:06:31 my food to arrive I am going to order a fish fillet
00:06:40 now my food has just arrived I
00:06:44 ordered a fish fillet and it comes
00:06:47 accompanied by some potatoes in
00:06:51 wedges rice and vegetables and I am also
00:06:56 having something cold because  Yes, the heat
00:06:59 is strong today I checked and it was 31 degrees and
00:07:05 that is very hot throughout the year,
00:07:08 an average is taken and the climate could
00:07:12 be said to be 28 degrees Celsius
00:07:15 because it is a beach area we are
00:07:18 above sea level and  That
00:07:21 makes the humidity hotter and you climb a
00:07:24 lot but well I'm going to stop talking and
00:07:27 now we are going to eat
00:07:31 [Music]
00:07:37 we have finished eating and how delicious I

009,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you not only about the
00:00:04 television series of the best
00:00:06 series but also about the series that
00:00:11 are easier to understand.
00:00:22 Hello, this video is going to be in three
00:00:26 parts. I am going to talk about three types of
00:00:29 series. The first is series.  Spanish
00:00:33 original series in Spanish in Spanish
00:00:37 from Spain the second are
00:00:39 Mexican series I have also searched for series from
00:00:43 other countries but it seems that it is much
00:00:46 easier to see Mexican series
00:00:49 especially above all to find them online and
00:00:52 such and the third are dubbed
00:00:56 series series that are  Originally in other
00:00:59 languages ​​but the series have been dubbed into
00:01:02 Spanish, both the Spanish
00:01:06 and the Mexican ones, you can see them with
00:01:09 a Netflix account,
00:01:11 even if you have an account in your
00:01:14 country, a US account, for example,
00:01:17 you can see all the Spanish and
00:01:21 Mexican series.  dubbed that have been dubbed
00:01:24 into Spanish the ones that I am going to tell you
00:01:28 need to use netflix from Spain
00:01:32 so if you are in another country I
00:01:35 recommend  or use a vpn and I recommend you
00:01:39 as in the other video I recommend
00:01:41 express express or vpn
00:01:45 I leave the link in the
00:01:47 description below and if you sign up for express
00:01:50 vpn then also contributing 'aces' to
00:01:54 dreaming spanish also helps
00:01:56 us so first the
00:02:01 I think you can see series from Spain with any
00:02:04 netflix account. The
00:02:08 first one is for you to take your legs off
00:02:11 at is a series a series about an
00:02:15 agent an agent for actors and actresses
00:02:19 an agent is a person who is looking for a job for you
00:02:23 or not
00:02:24 a representative yes so paquita
00:02:28 salas was a very
00:02:33 successful representative in the past but the world has
00:02:36 changed no one wants her anymore the
00:02:41 actors abandon her and well little feet she is going to
00:02:44 have to find a solution and it is
00:02:47 a series of laughable humor  no
00:02:50 that it is original Spanish
00:02:54 and that it began as a web series but it
00:02:59 was so successful that netflix bought it and
00:03:02 netflix has continued to produce more
00:03:04 episodes the next series is velvet
00:03:09 velvet is s  About a man, a rich man,
00:03:12 a man with a lot of money who works
00:03:15 in the world of fashion, in the world of
00:03:19 clothing, and who is in love with
00:03:23 a humble woman, with a woman from a
00:03:26 family with little money, and talks,
00:03:29 above all, about the  their love relationship, not
00:03:32 the cable girls, I think it's
00:03:35 more well-known, it's quite well-known, it's a
00:03:39 series that I also do
00:03:42 n't think originally but now it's still being
00:03:44 produced by Netflix and it's a series above
00:03:48 all about friendship as a group of
00:03:52 women
00:03:54 versus  the problems in the face of
00:03:57 adversities because they continue to support
00:04:00 each other and another important issue because it is the
00:04:03 fight for equality, for
00:04:06 gender equality, not and it is as the
00:04:10 name indicates to the cable girls, it is
00:04:12 a series about telephone operators
00:04:15 about women  that are in charge of operating
00:04:18 the telephone call connections and
00:04:22 this one is located in the 20s
00:04:26 before the Spanish civil war the next one

00:04:33 that  It was also very pop, very popular. It
00:04:37 is also located in a hotel at the
00:04:40 beginning of the 20th century, also before
00:04:43 the civil war, and it is such a
00:04:46 popular series that in the US they did a remake, they
00:04:50 did it in their own way, and the latest
00:04:54 Spanish series is elite elite.  It's a little
00:04:58 more difficult, they
00:05:00 're quite colloquial language, quite
00:05:03 informal language, no, and it's a series
00:05:07 about a school, a private school, an
00:05:10 expensive school with students, well, from
00:05:13 rich families where three new students arrive,

00:06:37 the next one is made in mexico and made in
00:06:41 mexico it is not a series it is more of a
00:06:44 reality a reality show and so here
00:06:47 you can see well  many
00:06:50 different people the way of speaking of
00:06:53 different people and you can see
00:06:56 more real conversation not real conversation
00:06:59 between people and the latest the
00:07:03 latest series from Mexico is the house of
00:07:07 flowers if not the house of paper not the house
00:07:11 of flowers and it is about  a florist
00:07:14 a family
00:07:16 in a flower shop that is doing very
00:07:19 well it is a good business
00:07:22 and the whole family seems like a very
00:07:25 united and very happy family but we begin to
00:07:30 know a little about the secrets the
00:07:33 hidden things inside  this family and that's it
00:07:37 these are these are the series from Mexico
00:07:41 the following dubbed series
00:07:45 I think they are all series from the USA that have
00:07:49 been dubbed into Spanish and the
00:07:53 dubbed series do not have this element of
00:07:55 the country's culture but well most
00:07:59 of the words are  Most of the
00:08:02 vocabulary that is used is still
00:08:05 normal and current Spanish vocabulary and
00:08:08 you can also use them to continue
00:08:11 improving your Spanish. These series,
00:08:15 depending on the country where you are,
00:08:18 surely not the ones from Aysén on Netflix,
00:08:21 so remember that I leave you
00:08:24 the link below in the link to sign up.  to
00:08:27 express
00:08:28 to be able to see them the first friends
00:08:33 friends of course friends is good a
00:08:36 classic not a classic of
00:08:38 the sitcom series and well it is true that it is a
00:08:42 very colloquial
00:08:45 conversation day to day conversation really
00:08:48 very useful conversations about the topics of the house of the
00:08:52 love friendship of life problems
00:08:56 no so I think it is quite easy
00:08:59 to understand and that it can help you with
00:09:03 c  Useful things to learn in Spanish
00:09:06 the following is how I met your
00:09:10 mother' and well how I met your
00:09:13 mother' it is similar to friends no no not
00:09:16 exactly but it is also a sitcom and it
00:09:20 also talks about many everyday
00:09:22 topics many day to day topics  Like from the
00:09:26 work house of the friends of the
00:09:29 and well I learned a lot of English with
00:09:33 I met your mother I learned a lot of
00:09:35 French too and I think it's a
00:09:38 very useful series than modern family'' modern
00:09:42 family is another another sitcom and well just
00:09:45 like  the other two, well, it has the same
00:09:47 advantages, in this case, there are also children,
00:09:51 there are small children, and you can learn the
00:09:54 vocabulary of younger people,
00:09:57 I don't know about sports, soccer, and
00:10:01 school things, and maybe in the other
00:10:04 series, well, there aren't  There isn't so much of
00:10:06 that vocabulary, more than spongebob yes yes
00:10:10 'spongebob' you can also see it in
00:10:13 Spanish and in this case, well, the
00:10:17 vocabulary is a bit different, it
00:10:19 talks a lot about sea things and such, but
00:10:23 yes  Do you like food, seafood and such,
00:10:26 well it is also a very useful series and it
00:10:30 is clear most of the words
00:10:33 are still Spanish
00:10:35 words like sleep eat go no
00:10:39 whatever I have two left one is
00:10:43 south park south park well it is one
00:10:47 mythical series and on netflix you have all the
00:10:51 episodes in spanish south park
00:10:54 helped me to learn swear words to learn
00:10:57 insults profanity is not a very
00:11:01 useful series for that it helped me a lot with
00:11:04 english with french too and all that
00:11:07 series again in french and  It is very useful
00:11:11 to learn this type of vocabulary
00:11:13 so all these all these
00:11:17 dubbed series are on netflix I am going to
00:11:21 recommend one more that is not on
00:11:23 netflix but I don't know maybe you
00:11:26 can find it somewhere that it is
00:11:30 the simpsons the simpsons is also one
00:11:32 Mythical series that surely all the
00:11:36 episodes will be dubbed into Spanish and
00:11:39 also, if you like them, it is a
00:11:42 series that is good for learning
00:11:44 Spanish and I do not recommend a very tidy series.
00:11:48 itches that is recommended is narcos but
00:11:51 I do not recommend watching narcos because
00:11:54 first they speak a lot in English they speak
00:11:58 both Spanish and English so you
00:12:01 are not taking advantage of the time
00:12:02 when they speak Spanish I think you always
00:12:05 have English subtitles that
00:12:10 distract you they make you read instead of being
00:12:13 listening is not good either and also
00:12:15 when they speak Spanish they do not speak very
00:12:19 clearly they do not pronounce very clearly they
00:12:22 speak with a
00:12:24 lot of jargon with vocabulary very
00:12:27 specific to their work or their
00:12:31 social class that is not used much in other
00:12:34 situations
00:12:35 and it is very difficult to understand and  Well, if
00:12:39 you have seen other series or
00:12:42 even movies that seemed
00:12:45 very easy to you, they have been very easy to
00:12:48 understand, so write it down in the
00:12:51 comments,
00:12:51 put them in the comments and that way you
00:12:54 will help other people and remember
00:12:58 that if you want to sign up for express vpn

",3
204,"00:00:00 hello air n
00:00:02 hello Pablo
00:00:03 how are you
00:00:05 very good and you are very good too I
00:00:09 present to you Irene Irene also has
00:00:12 a YouTube channel and today she came here
00:00:16 and she is going to tell us something there is something that
00:00:20 interests me about her life that her recent life
00:00:22 that  He is going to explain it to us
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:29 Irene where are you now
00:00:33 I am in Brussels which is a city
00:00:36 in Europe yes in Brussels in Belgium no
00:00:39 the capital
00:00:41 is the capital of Belgium yes I know it
00:00:44 is also a very important city for
00:00:46 the European Union it is  It is the capital of
00:00:51 the European Union, they say, because there are many European institutions here, the
00:00:57 European Parliament is in the
00:01:01 European Commission, and different institutions and
00:01:05 buildings where many
00:01:07 European Union officials work. Yes,
00:01:10 then Belgium is already a
00:01:14 country that has
00:01:16 233  official
00:01:18 languages ​​three official languages
00:01:23 French Dutch and German what happens is
00:01:26 that German is spoken by very few people
00:01:29 only 10% of the population
00:01:33 so that is why people think that it is only  n two
00:01:36 languages, it sounded to me that if there is a region
00:01:39 where German is spoken, not a small
00:01:41 part, if a small part, but also
00:01:45 in Brussels, of course, with so many
00:01:48 institutions of the European Union
00:01:51 , well, more languages ​​are spoken, and your work
00:01:56 is also somewhat related to  That,
00:01:59 then, I want you to explain to me a little about
00:02:00 what it's like to live like this using so many languages
00:02:03 on a day-to-day basis. It's a lot of fun, at
00:02:07 least it seems to me because I
00:02:09 really like languages,
00:02:11 so in the city, as you say, in
00:02:14 addition to both.  official languages
00:02:16 well, the three official languages ​​you also
00:02:20 listen to other languages ​​all the time,
00:02:22 especially European ones, because as we said
00:02:25 there are many workers from the
00:02:28 European institutions who come from
00:02:30 European countries, Italy,
00:02:33 Germany, Poland, but
00:02:35 the same thing happens at my job, I work in  a school and it
00:02:39 is a European school where, in addition to
00:02:43 Spanish children who are the ones I
00:02:46 teach, there are also children whose first
00:02:49 language is Italian  others Danish
00:02:53 German Polish like this up to eight languages
00:02:57 Pablo every day I have the opportunity
00:02:59 to speak in the languages ​​that I speak
00:03:03 which are five not eight but I
00:03:06 have a great time and since there are so many
00:03:08 children well Spanish and others  countries
00:03:11 there because there are many parents who
00:03:15 work in these institutions
00:03:17 that we are talking about so perhaps the
00:03:20 parents were born in Spain and have had
00:03:23 their children in Spain but for work reasons they
00:03:26 have emigrated to Brussels
00:03:30 and their children speak Spanish better than
00:03:33 other languages ​​then  They want the
00:03:36 school to do it in Spanish so
00:03:39 you have separate groups for each language
00:03:42 that is now we have, for example,
00:03:44 imagine first grade when the
00:03:47 children start school when they
00:03:50 learn to write and at six years old, yes,
00:03:53 there are eight classes for
00:03:57 children of  Six years old, one class learns to
00:04:01 read in Italian, in another they learn to read
00:04:03 in Spanish, and thus up to eight languages, and
00:04:07 among them they also speak in that language
00:04:09 as much as  The best thing about this school is that at
00:04:13 certain times of the
00:04:15 week the different children
00:04:20 of various languages ​​mix together and do activities
00:04:22 together in English or French,
00:04:25 normally
00:04:27 because they are two languages ​​that are very
00:04:31 commonly learned as a
00:04:33 foreign language,
00:04:34 that is if most of  The children at my
00:04:38 school learn English or French as a
00:04:41 second language and some also learn German.
00:04:44 Those three languages ​​are the ones that
00:04:46 children can learn in primary school. Okay,
00:04:49 so they get together to learn these
00:04:51 languages ​​and to do some class plus
00:04:53 gym class and so on.
00:04:57 Not to do gymnastics, they do it with their
00:05:00 classmates. We call it a
00:05:02 section, because with Susan, with their
00:05:04 Spanish or Italian classmates, they
00:05:06 meet to learn about things in
00:05:08 Europe. They are called European hours, so they
00:05:11 learn about the culture of different
00:05:14 European countries, about gastronomy or
00:05:17 about music I also think that it is
00:05:20 a class that we did not have when we were little we
00:05:25 did not have at all because  And I, Pablo,
00:05:27 studied in a school in Spain, you
00:05:30 too, right, yes, in a normal public school,
00:05:34 and I didn't have any subject
00:05:37 called European hours,
00:05:40 so your school, the school where
00:05:43 you work, is
00:05:45 part of the European Union, it's something
00:05:48 official, I've never finished it.  to know
00:05:51 but I think it was worth it, it depends on the
00:05:53 European Commission because you have
00:05:56 n't been there for a long time I haven't been there for a
00:05:58 very long time so I came
00:06:02 a month ago so the school is new for me,
00:06:04 the school and also the city
00:06:06 everything is new but and it's the first  Whenever
00:06:10 you teach in a school or already in
00:06:13 Spain, before I already taught
00:06:15 in Spain I also taught and that helped me a
00:06:19 lot because since here I am also
00:06:21 teaching Spanish children everything I
00:06:23 learned in Madrid because I taught in
00:06:26 Madrid I can now apply it to my
00:06:28 students too  I want to tell you
00:06:31 that getting here has not been easy because
00:06:34 every time we change countries and
00:06:36 emigrate we have to do a lot of
00:06:38 things that make it a bit difficult if
00:06:40 I'm sure you don't live in Spain either,
00:06:42 you've really had to
00:06:46 face several processes
00:06:49 like this but of course I imagined that if it's
00:06:53 another country within the European Union that
00:06:56 it wouldn't be very difficult, that's not what I thought
00:06:58 I've also lived if I  I have also
00:07:01 lived in Germany or Italy, I was not in
00:07:05 Finland and it was not very difficult, but of
00:07:07 course I was a student, I was not a
00:07:09 worker, maybe it is not the same, well, yes,
00:07:12 maybe the same thing happened to me. I
00:07:14 came here to work and I have had to
00:07:16 do many things.  more paperwork much more
00:07:19 paperwork than I do when I go as a
00:07:22 student and it has surprised me a lot
00:07:25 because it is true that I think
00:07:27 things are
00:07:30 easier for Europeans but even so you have to go to many
00:07:33 places to register call many
00:07:36 institutions and  Making an appointment in many
00:07:38 banks to open an account, for
00:07:40 example,
00:07:42 is still difficult.
00:07:45 There are many people who are curious and
00:07:48 who ask me and ask me
00:07:51 online about learning several languages
00:07:55 or speaking  speak several languages ​​on a day-to-
00:07:57 day basis, so I wanted to ask you a bit,
00:07:59 I mean, I also have experience with
00:08:01 this subject, but I wanted
00:08:05 you to tell us about your experiences as
00:08:06 well, for example, it is difficult on a day-
00:08:11 to-day basis.
00:08:14 a situation where you are with
00:08:16 different people with whom you speak
00:08:18 different languages ​​it is difficult to switch from
00:08:21 one language to another yes yes it happens to me
00:08:24 my work is always there not everyone
00:08:29 speaks french and not everyone speaks
00:08:31 english so the other day  For example,
00:08:34 all the teachers
00:08:37 of the 3rd grade of primary school were together
00:08:39 and we had to say everything we decided and
00:08:43 everything we
00:08:45 said in both languages, French and
00:08:48 English. Sometimes it is difficult to make the
00:08:50 effort to use two languages, but of course
00:08:54 if  there is only one person who does not understand
00:08:56 the language we normally use, they
00:09:01 would already feel excluded so I think that
00:09:03 whenever we are with someone who does not
00:09:05 understand the main language  you have to
00:09:08 make the effort to translate it this
00:09:10 means that it takes us much longer to
00:09:13 finish a meeting because we
00:09:15 need twice the time but in my opinion the
00:09:18 only way to get everyone to
00:09:20 communicate is by asking what languages
00:09:23 people speak and doing translations
00:09:25 all the time of course  I know about this I think that
00:09:29 we Spaniards are a little guilty.
00:09:33 I remember when I went to study
00:09:34 abroad that sometimes we were a group
00:09:37 of Spaniards but there was someone from another
00:09:40 country who did not speak Spanish and between
00:09:42 us we spoke Spanish instead of
00:09:46 changing and speaking all  In English I don't know
00:09:48 if it happened to you too if you continue as a
00:09:51 student it also happened to me and I think that's
00:09:54 also why people who have
00:09:58 Spanish friends learn Spanish very
00:10:00 quickly because we Spaniards
00:10:02 like to speak Spanish a lot, right
00:10:05 even if they don't understand it  Everything we speak
00:10:08 to people in Spanish
00:10:10 has a positive side, which is that
00:10:12 people learn Spanish quickly if they have
00:10:14 Spanish friends.  but they can also
00:10:16 have a negative side, which is that that
00:10:18 person can feel a bit excluded,
00:10:21 don't you think, and well, I think we
00:10:23 have to ask the person how
00:10:26 they feel if they don't mind that we speak
00:10:28 in Spanish because maybe they are
00:10:29 interested in  learn Spanish and if you
00:10:32 say no, you prefer that we speak in
00:10:34 English, which is the lingua franca, not that
00:10:37 many people speak, well, we should
00:10:39 switch to English.
00:10:41 I wanted to ask you about living there.
00:10:45 I know that you have lived there for a short time,
00:10:47 but living there has started  to
00:10:50 draw attention to a new language
00:10:53 that you now want to learn or what you
00:10:55 want to improve because I
00:10:58 speak German at an intermediate level and since
00:11:00 German is also one of the
00:11:02 official languages ​​of the European Union, I would
00:11:05 love to improve it but for
00:11:07 a while now  year when last year of good
00:11:10 england and i shared a flat with a
00:11:12 girl from hong kong i am very interested
00:11:15 in the languages ​​of asia and some language i
00:11:18 don't know which one but i would like  to start
00:11:20 learning an Asian language you are
00:11:25 interested in learning a new language
00:11:27 well too many
00:11:30 I tell you when you start learning
00:11:33 an Asian language it is like opening
00:11:35 Pandora's box but no but yes but it
00:11:39 is very interesting because of course
00:11:40 you want to  Not within Europe we have a
00:11:44 lot of overlap between the cultures
00:11:47 of the different countries,
00:11:51 so when you learn another
00:11:53 European language and have direct access to that
00:11:57 culture, what the people of
00:11:59 that country say, well, you do learn things that you
00:12:02 didn't know, some curiosity and such, but of
00:12:04 course.  In Asia, the culture is very
00:12:08 different and everything that comes to us from
00:12:11 Asia is filtered by the point
00:12:15 of view of a Western person
00:12:18 who has translated it into our language, who
00:12:20 has translated it into Spanish or English, no, and
00:12:23 you never have that opportunity.  to
00:12:27 have that first-hand experience of
00:12:30 what people
00:12:32 from Asian countries say and do and then I
00:12:37 would like to know if you decide to learn or  n
00:12:41 Asian language I don't know if you were
00:12:43 thinking that in Chinese because your friend is
00:12:47 from Hong Kong or you are considering
00:12:49 other options
00:12:51 because Laura from the spam channel is after
00:12:54 hours told me that she started with
00:12:57 Korean because they told her it was the
00:13:00 language  Asian easier no then
00:13:02 maybe I'll start there too I don't know
00:13:06 if you've already started with one and
00:13:08 can you tell me which one is easier because I
00:13:11 don't want to get discouraged right now I have a lot of
00:13:13 things I'm very busy and I don't have much
00:13:16 time to study a language that is
00:13:18 Very difficult, you are going to recommend
00:13:20 Portuguese
00:13:23 not to see this I see this question
00:13:27 many times from people asking today
00:13:29 what language I should study I would never
00:13:32 study a language because it is
00:13:35 easier than another if clearly there is a
00:13:38 language that interests me more than I think it
00:13:40 will  I'm going to get more out
00:13:41 of it, especially being such different languages,
00:13:45 whether you want to learn Korean or
00:13:47 Japanese or Chinese, it's going to be a
00:13:50 huge investment of time because
00:13:52 if korean the alphabet is very easy
00:13:56 but in everything else it's still a
00:13:59 completely different language from
00:14:01 ours and it's going to take a long time
00:14:04 then i think you're more
00:14:07 likely to continue if it's something
00:14:09 you really like that motivates you you think
00:14:12 you're going to  You will be able to use it
00:14:14 in the future, even if it is, I don't know if you
00:14:18 like movies, they are Japanese cartoons,
00:14:20 well, learn Japanese, it
00:14:23 is already something that you know you are going to have
00:14:25 and you will be able to continue using it for the rest
00:14:27 of your life.  life is very good advice
00:14:30 [Music]
00:14:32 in my case look now I'm going to
00:14:34 contradict myself a bit
00:14:36 but well right now I'm learning
00:14:39 Chinese Mandarin Chinese
00:14:42 but after Chinese I want to learn
00:14:44 Portuguese because and that's going to
00:14:47 contradict me a bit because yes let's see
00:14:48 I'm going to learn because it's easy, okay,
00:14:51 but that's
00:14:53 the thing, I think it's very,
00:14:56 and someone who speaks Spanish,
00:15:00 especially someone who speaks
00:15:02 Spanish and French like you and me, it's
00:15:04 very easy for us.  And in the end, well, it will
00:15:07 surely be an investment of a few
00:15:10 hundred hours
00:15:12 and I think I will be able to reach a good
00:15:14 level of Portuguese, even if it is
00:15:16 just
00:15:17 to be able to watch movies and understand
00:15:21 music in Portuguese and occasionally
00:15:24 speak  With someone who meets me from
00:15:26 Brazil or Portugal I think she is
00:15:29 worth it and above all because I want to
00:15:31 rest a bit because I have three
00:15:35 very difficult languages ​​in a row
00:15:36 Japanese, Thai and Chinese
00:15:39 incredible so I do want the
00:15:43 next one I want to look for an easier one
00:15:45 better  Since you speak Thai that they
00:15:48 understand you on the street they always use it
00:15:50 sometime you have to change English
00:15:52 as it's good on the street and in society
00:15:57 here Thai always because there are very
00:15:59 few people who understand that understand
00:16:01 English talking to my wife it's more
00:16:03 maybe half and  half every time I go maybe
00:16:06 talking to him too much in Thai although I
00:16:09 shouldn't should speak to him in Spanish
00:16:11 because my wife would have to learn Spanish
00:16:14 in the  future who wants to
00:16:16 learn wants to learn but doesn't want to
00:16:18 get tired he doesn't want to dedicate the effort
00:16:21 and time it takes he would like to
00:16:24 know but he doesn't want to learn
00:16:25 let's say
00:16:28 if I don't know I'm going to have to make it
00:16:30 easy for him because of course if in the future we
00:16:33 might want to  Yes, we do want to
00:16:37 spend one year or another in Spain
00:16:40 and of course it would be important for her that
00:16:42 she could communicate if necessary in
00:16:45 Spain to speak Spanish as we have said,
00:16:48 Spanish people like to speak
00:16:50 Spanish a lot and if you live in Spain, you need
00:16:53 Spanish, let's
00:16:55 see.  there are people there are expatriates
00:16:58 who manage to live there without speaking
00:17:01 any Spanish but of course you limit yourself to
00:17:04 living in the bubble of talking with other
00:17:08 foreigners who live there only go
00:17:11 to bars and restaurants for
00:17:13 foreigners and it is very very limited and I
00:17:16 think  that this only happens in
00:17:18 big cities because if you go to a
00:17:20 small city or live in a more rural area it is
00:17:23 difficult to find other expatriates yes
00:17:26 yes I have seen that but  What has
00:17:30 happened to people who went to Spain perhaps to
00:17:33 learn Spanish but they got a boyfriend and
00:17:37 the boyfriend lives in a small town in
00:17:40 Catalonia where everyone speaks
00:17:42 Catalan, and they complained about that because
00:17:45 they couldn't practice Spanish,
00:17:49 well, Irene many  Thank you for
00:17:52 telling us about your experience in that place,
00:17:56 so multicultural that I think
00:17:59 I have been
00:18:01 I have visited Brussels I have been doing
00:18:04 tourism there but I have not had the
00:18:06 experience of living there and yes it is
00:18:09 very interesting to have that
00:18:12 opportunity to learn various  languages ​​and being
00:18:14 able to practice them every day,
00:18:16 especially with your work no yes
00:18:19 yes I really like it
00:18:21 thank you very much I've had a
00:18:24 great time yes and well we're going to record another
00:18:28 video for irene's channel so if
00:18:31 you want to see it I'll leave you  the link below in
00:18:34 the description you can click and go to
00:18:37 irene's channel and see the video that we have
00:18:40 recorded together and see the other videos of
00:18:43 irene that irene also has videos of
00:18:46 practicing and  listen
00:18:49 to scenes simulating
00:18:52 real life situations and such that I think are also
00:18:54 very interesting
00:18:57 and thank you very much and see you
00:19:00 again bye

036,"00:00:00 Today I am going to continue talking about
00:00:05 the history of Spain' and I am going to talk
00:00:10 about something that many many of you
00:00:14 wanted to hear and that is the invasion the
00:00:19 invasion of the Muslims
00:00:24 [Music]
00:00:29 in the previous video I told you about the
00:00:34 Visigoths the Visigoths  They were
00:00:40 in the Iberian Peninsula, but
00:00:44 the Visigoths were divided, they were
00:00:49 divided, that's why they didn't have much power, they
00:00:54 didn't have much strength, and in the 8th century,
00:01:01 in the 8th century, in the 700s and over
00:01:07 700s and overs after Christ,
00:01:11 the Muslims did not enter
00:01:16 and  very quickly very quickly the muslims
00:01:19 manage to conquer they conquer almost
00:01:24 the entire peninsula they conquer almost everything the peninsula
00:01:28 there are only areas in the
00:01:32 north where there are mountains and only
00:01:36 these areas they fail to conquer them
00:01:40 in this area several kingdoms
00:01:44 were formed here several kingdoms kingdoms kingdoms were formed
00:01:49 separate
00:01:54 Christian kingdoms Christian kingdoms of the
00:01:59 Christian religion were not Muslims and all of
00:02:04 this, this entire region was called al
00:02:08 anda  lus al andalus
00:02:12 was al andalus and that is why now in spain
00:02:17 there is still this community that is
00:02:21 andalusia and andalusia comes from andalusian
00:02:27 yes and al andalus al andalus and all this
00:02:33 region all this was a single kingdom one
00:02:38 country was called a caliphate a caliphate
00:02:43 all because  a caliph is like a king, not
00:02:49 the king in Arab culture is called a
00:02:53 caliph and spain al andalus was also
00:02:58 part of the caliphate of the same country and the
00:03:03 capital the capital of that country was in
00:03:07 baghdad in baghdad which is now iraq but
00:03:12 later al andalus
00:03:15 for  it separates from the caliphate and
00:03:20 becomes its own caliphate it
00:03:23 becomes the caliphate of córdoba the
00:03:26 capital was córdoba córdoba became
00:03:31 the capital the capital of the caliphate at
00:03:35 this time this was a Muslim era there was a
00:03:39 lot of tolerance here other
00:03:43 religions were tolerated religion was tolerated  Christianity
00:03:46 was tolerated Judaism Judaism was
00:03:50 also tolerated and the other
00:03:53 religions were also not a problem and
00:03:57 at this time many Jews came to Spain
00:04:01 many people from  The Jewish religion
00:04:05 and this period was very important for
00:04:11 science, for
00:04:15 science, art, for art, and for
00:04:19 culture, and that is why now in Spanish
00:04:23 we have many Arabic
00:04:27 words, many words, yes, such as oil,
00:04:31 oil is a word that comes from  from
00:04:34 Arabic also sugar sugar the
00:04:39 word sugar comes from the Arabic the
00:04:42 word carpet carpet also and
00:04:46 chess chess do you know what chess is
00:04:51 no chess if later there was a
00:04:57 war there was a war in the caliphate and
00:05:01 it broke up it broke up into several parts
00:05:07 yes  and the Christian kingdoms
00:05:11 the northern kingdoms were invading invading
00:05:14 invading yes and in the next video in
00:05:19 the next video I will explain how they
00:05:23 managed to drive out the
00:05:27 Muslims how the northern kingdoms
00:05:30 managed to reconquer
00:05:34 reconquer the rest of the
00:05:37 Iberian Peninsula and you in  your language
00:05:42 have arabic words do you have a
00:05:45 word that comes from arabic tell
00:05:49 me tell me which ones are worth come see you later
00:06:04 the capital was cordoba cordoba
",3
052,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about why because the
00:00:07 translation of a word because it is
00:00:10 knowing the translation knowing which gene is
00:00:15 human
00:00:16 is only a very small part a
00:00:20 very small part of what a word is
00:00:24 [Music] well
00:00:31 many people many people who
00:00:35 study  Spanish or who study a
00:00:39 language learn vocabulary they do not learn
00:00:44 words they learn lists of words in
00:00:49 a list or they learn words with hank and
00:00:54 for example with a mobile application
00:00:58 and many times they learn those words
00:01:01 they study them looking at translations
00:01:07 looking at the meaning of
00:01:12 that word  In another language, for example,
00:01:15 for example, they learn that mano mano in
00:01:20 English it is said andy no well well and he does
00:01:25 one more word in Spanish no no because
00:01:30 knowing that knowing the translation is
00:01:35 a very small part of what
00:01:38 a word is a word is not only  the
00:01:43 image the hand is not worth hand is hand but
00:01:49 hand is many many more things for
00:01:53 example hand is in many expressions
00:01:58 it is used with other meanings  [ __ ] that is not
00:02:02 the hand no
00:02:04 for example lend a hand
00:02:07 also hand has other things that
00:02:12 are not the meaning that are not the
00:02:16 writing for example how it is used in
00:02:22 a sentence the grammar of the word
00:02:25 how it is used hand is a noun no  is
00:02:29 noun hand one hand hand is
00:02:34 feminine hand one hand two hands hand is
00:02:38 countable we can count count how many
00:02:42 hands
00:02:43 after a word a word may
00:02:47 be appropriate may be okay to say it
00:02:51 in a situation in a place in a place
00:02:54 with some people but not with others
00:02:59 people you would speak
00:03:03 to differently there are certain words
00:03:06 I would not use with certain people
00:03:10 formal words informal words and
00:03:15 that is also part of a word to
00:03:19 be learned
00:03:20 there are so many things in a word that
00:03:24 is not the translation knowing the
00:03:27 translation of a  word we don't know
00:03:32 99% of that word we don't know how to use it
00:03:37 speaking speaking we don't know how to use it in a
00:03:40 sentence we don't know how to combine it combine it
00:03:44 with other words
00:03:47 a  In the end I think I think that knowing the
00:03:50 translation of a word is very
00:03:54 useless It is of very little use and knowing the
00:04:00 translation and thinking Thinking about the
00:04:02 translation every time I think it can cause
00:04:07 problems It can be a problem because
00:04:11 the word hand is not used in the same way
00:04:16 way in Spanish than in English or in
00:04:19 another language and having that connection that
00:04:24 connection in the brain between one word
00:04:27 and the other in both languages
00:04:31 can have problems it can make you use
00:04:35 saying that word
00:04:39 wrongly saying the word wrongly using it in a
00:04:44 phrase use it where it is not appropriate to use it where it
00:04:47 is wrong to use it or use it in a
00:04:51 misused way
00:04:53 that is why when I learn when I
00:04:58 study a language I try not to use
00:05:01 translations
00:05:03 and
00:05:05 a word a word when I hear
00:05:09 or read it I do not try to memorize memorize a
00:05:14 hand in hand hand hand hand hand no
00:05:17 because I know that 99% of the word
00:05:24 is not there it is not hand and
00:05:28 that's it I have to see I have to hear that word
00:05:31 in many many places many yes
00:05:34 different guys to know how to use it to
00:05:38 know which hand is feminine which hand is
00:05:42 countable which hand is a word that is
00:05:46 used for people but not for animals
00:05:49 for example there are many things
00:05:54 and well this is my recommendation to
00:05:58 you is
00:06:00 not not to rely on translations no  to think
00:06:05 that by knowing how to translate a word
00:06:09 you know the word and get to hear
00:06:14 more Spanish and read more Spanish and perhaps
00:06:19 not use so many applications or use so many
00:06:24 dictionaries and other utilities other
00:06:28 resources that are more about translation than
00:06:33 using translation more about studying than
00:06:36 actually listening or  read the language okay
00:06:42 come see you later
",3
099,"00:00:00 and today I'm going to make a slightly
00:00:04 different video I'm also going to show you my
00:00:08 studio I'm going to show you the studio
00:00:10 where he recorded videos no
00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:19 oh well this is my house where I live is my
00:00:22 apartment and I have a corner here the corner
00:00:26 from this one here where my studio is
00:00:29 you can see the famous background and well this
00:00:35 is where I sit to record videos
00:00:37 so what you see the most what
00:00:41 stands out the most are the lights not the lights are
00:00:46 studio lights lights to record
00:00:49 videos are from video
00:00:52 Well, you can see that they are very
00:00:54 bright, they light up the board a lot, they
00:00:58 light up mimicry, it also gives when I'm
00:01:01 recording videos and since they're so big, you
00:01:04 don't see much shadow in the hand.
00:01:11 very hard they
00:01:14 are not very very defined shadows it does not look
00:01:18 like this a more diffuse shape a shadow a
00:01:21 softer shadow a softer shadow
00:01:25 and I'm going to turn them off because if not you don't
00:01:27 see nothing you can't see anything except the lights
00:01:31 okay
00:01:33 then
00:01:35 I have the blackboard  he  the blackboard is a
00:01:39 white board a blackboard skill
00:01:41 good very simple
00:01:42 like any blackboard any blackboard
00:01:44 really works well any blackboard works
00:01:48 I have marked the shape of the
00:01:51 area where I can draw because
00:01:54 here in this area is that I have
00:01:58 the shape marked here
00:02:00 this is where in the video you can see my face you
00:02:02 can see my face here so here I
00:02:06 can't I can't draw that's why I have the
00:02:08 area marked I don't know if you see it I have little
00:02:11 dots here marked where you can't
00:02:14 draw and it's all use well to put
00:02:17 to put the markers to
00:02:20 maybe put my mobile if I have a
00:02:23 script of the video of the things I want to
00:02:26 say on my mobile, well I usually put it here
00:02:28 here or well, no,
00:02:31 and if now I am using the mobile
00:02:34 to record the video, not just record
00:02:36 videos with my mobile but now I want to show you
00:02:39 the cameras that's why I'm using
00:02:41 my mobile
00:02:42 so
00:02:46 I have here my tripod I guess
00:02:48 you've seen it it's a tripod it's a tripod
00:02:51 a tripod bas  normal stand
00:02:53 you will see that here
00:02:57 the water bottle has three legs, these are to give it
00:02:59 stability so that it is more stable
00:03:01 so that it does not fall because here I have
00:03:04 a large camera that is heavy
00:03:06 and can fall, it can lie down so
00:03:09 the tripod here has a hook, no  I know if
00:03:12 you see it here it has a hook you can
00:03:15 hang a weight you can hang something that
00:03:18 weighs to make it more stable but hey it
00:03:20 's a fairly normal tripod
00:03:23 which is a fairly high tripod that
00:03:25 reaches quite high no and
00:03:27 I have something else  it did not come with the
00:03:31 tripod it was not original to the tripod
00:03:33 but i bought it separately what is this
00:03:35 extension
00:03:37 this is an extension and it came together it
00:03:40 came in the same package this this
00:03:44 is with a joint it articulates to
00:03:48 see if i can do it it articulates no
00:03:50 it articulates like this and you can choose the angle
00:03:54 the angle in which you want to place it and
00:03:57 also rotate it also rotates like
00:04:01 this no so this joint and this bar
00:04:05 came together it's
00:04:08 a good thing u  n addition for the
00:04:12 tripod so here is how I hold
00:04:14 the camera the upper camera
00:04:17 but I have something else I also have the
00:04:19 camera for my face it is not there it is the camera
00:04:23 for the blackboard and this is the camera
00:04:26 in which you can see my face you can see my  hands
00:04:27 the body and this I have with a
00:04:32 how would I say this like a a clamp
00:04:36 would not be a clamp this is a clamp that
00:04:39 hooked it to the tube to the tube of the tripod I
00:04:47 don't know if it looks very good but I hook the
00:04:49 pizza here and then I close it today  It is
00:04:52 difficult to do this with one hand and well,
00:04:55 the clamp is hooked here, not since it
00:04:57 is a clamp I can put it at any
00:04:59 height you can take the height without any
00:05:01 problem
00:05:04 then here I have a ball joint this is a
00:05:08 ball joint let's see if you can see it it
00:05:10 's a ball joint one  quite normal ball head
00:05:13 normally tripods come with one
00:05:16 but this one was bought separately this is
00:05:20 a ball head that allows you to have
00:05:22 various angles put the camera at the
00:05:24 angle that suits you
00:05:28 you can
00:05:30 you can put the camera at the angle
00:05:32 that suits you  Okay, so I have the clamp
00:05:37 with an adapter. You need one of these adapters, well
00:05:41 , I
00:05:43 buy it from Amazon because I don't know if there are
00:05:45 stores that have such specific things,
00:05:47 but hey, this is an
00:05:50 adapter for the tripod hole.
00:05:53 The cameras have a  hole for a
00:05:56 tripod and this is an adapter, well, from
00:05:59 male to male
00:06:02 because the clamp has a female here and in the
00:06:04 ball joint well it also has a female and this,
00:06:07 well, I'll put it well, so it
00:06:11 can be screwed here,
00:06:16 the camera is better, maybe  camera I can talk
00:06:18 about the camera itself this camera
00:06:21 is basically a pro it's the same as
00:06:23 I buy them it's a Chinese brand yi and iii and
00:06:28 iv it's cheaper but the quality
00:06:30 is also very good it has a lot of resolution and the
00:06:33 truth is that it suits me a lot  well before I
00:06:35 had a do pro but it was an old gopro it
00:06:38 was a quite old ago pro group
00:06:41 and the quality was not very
00:06:43 good
00:06:45 so if you just recorded with this
00:06:49 camera with this camera what happens is
00:06:51 that d  The front has no screen I
00:06:53 can't see myself and what I use to
00:06:56 see myself is a mobile application on my
00:06:59 mobile on my phone I have an app and with
00:07:02 it I can see what the camera sees I can
00:07:05 see if I'm well squared I can see that
00:07:07 the background is that the background is also
00:07:09 well squared that it fits well
00:07:13 what else do I have the upper camera the
00:07:17 upper camera it was quite difficult for me to
00:07:20 choose a camera and in the end I decided
00:07:24 on this one it is a mirror camera les a
00:07:27 mirror les is like an SLR like a
00:07:29 camera  large of photos but it is a little
00:07:31 smaller
00:07:33 and
00:07:36 basically the grace is that it has a
00:07:39 screen like this and if I remove the cover
00:07:45 if it is there I will put it in automatic mode
00:07:49 so that it can be seen
00:07:51 but hey it is that here on the screen well
00:07:54 you can see it  that the camera is
00:07:57 seeing and here, well, I can adjust, you
00:08:00 can adjust the camera so
00:08:02 that they break or fit and see the
00:08:05 entire board, no, and I can squeeze it,
00:08:10 well, now with one hand I won't be
00:08:12 able to, but
00:08:14 this is the ideal, you squeeze and  in  once, well,
00:08:16 you see, you
00:08:18 have to adjust it so that it captures the
00:08:20 entire board no, nothing happens if it
00:08:23 captures more normally I captured more
00:08:25 recorded more the most and a little smaller
00:08:28 than grave more piece no instead of
00:08:32 zooming no well I reduce the zoom that  it captures the
00:08:34 whole screen and then when I am
00:08:37 editing the video I make it big I
00:08:39 extend it so that it occupies all the space
00:08:41 of the video and I will show you how to edit the
00:08:44 video in another in another video okay I will make
00:08:47 another separate video showing different
00:08:49 programs that you can use to edit the
00:08:53 video  that I recorded is with this
00:08:55 so I have I have the camera this
00:09:01 other camera here
00:09:04 by the way another advantage of having a
00:09:06 camera like this is first that it has
00:09:09 manual mode I can put it in a mode that does not change it
00:09:12 does not automatically adapt to the brightness
00:09:15 of the scene then from the  moment
00:09:18 that I give it to record it always maintains the
00:09:21 same brightness the same brightness of the
00:09:23 scene the most the same the same color no
00:09:26 does not become
00:09:28 lighter darker lighter darker over  re everything if you use
00:09:33 sheets for example if you show maps or
00:09:36 show large things it
00:09:37 may be that the brightness changes technically change the
00:09:41 exposure and
00:09:44 that makes everything lighter darker and it doesn't look
00:09:46 so pretty then it's good for me to
00:09:49 have a camera with mode  Manual so
00:09:51 that it is constant throughout the video
00:09:53 and another advantage is that this
00:09:56 camera also has memory, it has modes,
00:10:00 pre-programmed modes, you can configure
00:10:02 it and then save the configuration and
00:10:06 if I put it in the good mode, this camera is
00:10:08 the mode that the g mode, well, mode  that it
00:10:11 has been saved from the last time that when
00:10:13 I recorded so I know that I put it in
00:10:15 this mode and it is ready it is ready
00:10:17 to record videos I do not have to look at
00:10:20 all the options all the settings
00:10:22 every time and I can when I take the
00:10:26 camera yes  I'm going on a trip or I'm going
00:10:28 somewhere to take photos with the camera. I can
00:10:31 put it in the other modes in
00:10:33 automatic mode or whatever it is to take photos or
00:10:35 record videos and when I come back here I can
00:10:38 go.  Look at the way it has memory and it's
00:10:41 very easy to record what else I
00:10:45 have I have markers I've also tried
00:10:48 various types of markers and these
00:10:51 are the ones that work best for me the big
00:10:54 big bill age
00:10:57 and I think I lived through Marc's age
00:10:59 ability there are other types but these
00:11:01 really are the ones that work best for me they
00:11:05 make a thick or very thick line that
00:11:08 is very easy to see and also with a
00:11:10 very intense color it does not fit well it is black it
00:11:12 is black it is completely black or
00:11:14 completely red or blue it does not fit
00:11:18 as well as a little transparent that doesn't look
00:11:20 very good, no, well, these suit me, it suits me very
00:11:22 well.
00:11:33 and I have
00:11:37 this also this is a voice recorder
00:11:39 so I use this this part seems
00:11:43 quite professional but it is not it is not
00:11:45 very expensive but it is not strictly
00:11:49 necessary if you are going to start recording
00:11:52 videos I don't think you don't need it  itáis
00:11:55 I bought this because I found
00:11:58 problems with noise when recording the sound
00:12:01 to record even using a microphone
00:12:03 sometimes you hear noise it would be like
00:12:06 electrical noise and I did not like having
00:12:09 that
00:12:10 electrical so the good thing about this
00:12:16 of this voice recorder  It supports
00:12:18 cable, so this is a cable with 3 with 3
00:12:21 pins but it is not a stereo microphone it is
00:12:24 a single microphone it is not stereo but it
00:12:27 has 3 pins because it has a system it
00:12:30 uses a system so that it does not have noise
00:12:33 that electrical noise does not enter
00:12:36 not to hear that noise that was
00:12:39 a problem
00:12:40 for me and for me it was a problem because before I
00:12:43 used the computer to record I used it on a
00:12:46 PC and I had a microphone connected to the PC
00:12:49 but then if I was recording or not it
00:12:53 was charging on the battery of the
00:12:56 computer or if I had the computer
00:12:57 plugged in to the current, noise was heard or
00:13:01 if the cable the microphone cable
00:13:02 passed close to something from an
00:13:05 electrical device noise was heard noise was heard
00:13:07 many times I don't know why many  sometimes
00:13:09 I don't know I have no idea why and with
00:13:12 this and with this well it doesn't happen
00:13:15 to me and it works much better for me there is an
00:13:18 alternative there is an easier way to
00:13:20 do it which is with a mobile phone in fact right
00:13:23 now I am using I am using a
00:13:26 mobile and connected with a microphone and by the
00:13:31 way keep putting things in the
00:13:33 description the things I use I will put
00:13:36 links below in the description so that
00:13:38 you can also buy them if
00:13:40 you want this is a microphone to
00:13:42 connect to the mobile no
00:13:45 so this is an alternative  very
00:13:47 valid that you can use many times
00:13:51 especially when I go when I go out to
00:13:53 record videos when I go to the park I carry
00:13:56 my mobile phone in my pocket and I carry a
00:13:58 microphone like this I have a microphone
00:14:00 connected here below the
00:14:03 lapel around my neck for good because I am not wearing a shirt
00:14:05 now but here and like that when I'm outside well
00:14:08 I don't pick up the electrical noise because
00:14:10 there isn't anything electrical there either there isn't
00:14:13 any device around me no and here
00:14:16 when I'm recording  if I'm in the
00:14:18 chair I think it shouldn't
00:14:21 be a problem it might have to be an
00:14:23 option
00:14:26 yes instead of using the camera if instead of
00:14:28 using a camera you use a mobile which
00:14:30 is also an option you can use a
00:14:32 mobile in both  hours both at the
00:14:34 top and the one in front it can be a
00:14:36 mobile it will be more difficult because especially
00:14:39 since you do not have the screen you do not have
00:14:42 the screen where you can see what you are
00:14:43 recording you have to place the mobile
00:14:45 here and come and look above and see and
00:14:48 see  if it's fine or not
00:14:51 or you can use the front
00:14:54 camera the self is camera and look at it from below no
00:14:58 I also suppose you can try you can
00:15:00 try the two cameras and see if the
00:15:02 front camera has enough
00:15:04 quality well that's fine it's enough
00:15:07 no but well the  Light is the most
00:15:09 important thing, there must be a lot of light and
00:15:12 if you have a camera, your face is well
00:15:14 lit, it is not so important that the
00:15:17 camera is very good. Let's say that it is more
00:15:19 important that you are well lit
00:15:21 than that the camera is  good but well of
00:15:24 course it's better if the camera is good
00:15:26 but many mobiles today many
00:15:30 mobiles from the last 5 years
00:15:33 already have very good cameras the truth is
00:15:36 okay then one thing I have not
00:15:40 told you is that everything is plugged into
00:15:42 the current everything  It is connected to a
00:15:45 plug everything is good everything is this is not this
00:15:48 is not usb now if I will show how how
00:15:50 I have the camera connected because it is
00:15:52 not it is not very obvious
00:15:55 the camera is simply connected with a
00:15:58 usb cable and if the cable is
00:16:00 connected then the camera  it can be
00:16:02 recording and charging the battery at the same time it
00:16:05 can do both things at the same time
00:16:06 so I never have problems with
00:16:09 the battery running out and I did this
00:16:12 because at the beginning I had those problems
00:16:14 that I was recording and the battery ran out
00:16:17 no  so now everything is
00:16:19 connected to the current both this
00:16:22 camera and this one as well as the voice recorder
00:16:25 I also have it here with a usb cable
00:16:28 that I have told about it
00:16:32 from paula
00:16:36 by the way this table is  The new one is a
00:16:38 liquid bamboo table that I
00:16:40 bought it because the previous one
00:16:42 broke my table broke just by supporting
00:16:44 my elbows and it is I love it I really like
00:16:47 this table
00:16:48 what's up this is quite a pain you don't
00:16:51 have to have the  slate you have to
00:16:54 have a camera with a tripod here and
00:16:56 such then there is another option there is another
00:17:00 option that I have used a bit
00:17:02 lately if you have seen my last
00:17:04 videos which is to use one of these so
00:17:08 this is a digitizing tablet is
00:17:11 a drawing tablet for  draw with
00:17:15 the computer that this has usb and it
00:17:18 plugs in it plugs into the computer and you can
00:17:22 use a drawing program to draw
00:17:24 to draw when what you are
00:17:26 doing in the video
00:17:30 then you
00:17:32 need a software to
00:17:34 capture the screen a software to
00:17:36 record the screen me
00:17:39 I don't like the software I'm using right now, it doesn't work very
00:17:42 well. I'll put other options below in
00:17:45 the description. I'll give you other
00:17:48 software options that you can use to record.
00:17:52 to record the screen then the idea
00:17:54 is that you draw here and you see it
00:17:57 on the computer screen and
00:18:00 the screen is recorded everything that is on
00:18:02 the computer screen is recorded
00:18:05 then you will have a video whether it
00:18:08 is recording it is the blackboard with a camera  as
00:18:11 if you draw on the computer it will be recorded
00:18:14 in a video and in the following video
00:18:17 I will explain how to put it all together, how to
00:18:20 synchronize so that both can be seen at
00:18:23 the same time and what software and programs
00:18:25 you can use
00:18:28 whether you have a PC or
00:18:31 a  mac I'll explain how you
00:18:33 can do it
00:18:36 I would say that it's been days I've
00:18:39 explained everything apart from that I have
00:18:42 a rag a damp rag that I wet
00:18:45 before recording before
00:18:48 starting to record videos and I use it to
00:18:51 clean the board or better  The rag that
00:18:54 I use are paper napkins, it's
00:18:56 more ecological.
00:19:08 beef and the markers
00:19:11 should be easily cleaned but they are not
00:19:13 always easily cleaned so
00:19:16 when it does not go away when the marker is not cleaned well,
00:19:19 I use a little alcohol
00:19:21 with the cookie with the cookie or
00:19:25 with a tissue with a tissue,
00:19:27 well I clean well  la
00:19:33 and that's it I think this has already explained
00:19:35 more or less
00:19:38 everything you need to record your
00:19:40 own videos as I told you in the
00:19:42 following video I will explain how to
00:19:44 edit it how to put it all together the
00:19:47 different files the two or three
00:19:49 files that you have and  put it all in
00:19:52 one video and post it on youtube
00:19:55 okay come see you later
00:19:59 and if you want more intermediate level videos
00:20:02 don't forget to sign up for
00:20:06 our daily video that every day
00:20:09 we make a new intermediate level video
00:20:11 sign up in the description
00:20:14 okay come on
00:20:20 [Music]
",3
055,"00:00:00 good
00:00:02 today I want to explain
00:00:05 why I don't put
00:00:10 written words I don't write words in
00:00:14 the videos I don't put words here or
00:00:18 words in the videos and why I don't
00:00:22 put subtitles because my videos don't
00:00:26 have subtitles
00:00:29 [Music]
00:00:35 hello well
00:00:36 many times a  some of
00:00:41 you ask me to put
00:00:46 subtitles to add subtitles to the
00:00:49 videos or to write words to
00:00:53 write some words
00:00:56 and today I am going to explain why I
00:00:59 don't do it
00:01:02 and the main reason the main reason
00:01:07 the most important  The reason why
00:01:11 I don't put subtitles is that it takes a
00:01:16 long time, it's a lot of work, it's a long time, a
00:01:20 long time to write, writing the
00:01:24 subtitles, putting them well in the video,
00:01:31 is the main reason and I think it's
00:01:37 better to make more videos,
00:01:41 make better videos, make more interesting videos.
00:01:45 to spend a lot of time writing
00:01:49 writing subtitles because then I
00:01:52 would do less I would do less videos
00:01:57 and this is the
00:02:00 main reason but  There is another reason that is
00:02:04 also very important and it is
00:02:09 the reason why I don't write I don't
00:02:12 write words on the table on the
00:02:15 blackboard either I don't write words here
00:02:20 in the video
00:02:22 and I think that at first it's
00:02:27 better to listen a lot you have to listen a
00:02:31 lot  Getting used to Spanish means getting
00:02:36 used to it means that it
00:02:40 seems normal
00:02:41 the first time the first time
00:02:45 you see something that surprises you, but if you
00:02:49 see it again and again and again and you
00:02:54 get used to it, it's normal because listening to
00:02:59 Spanish is the same.  You listen to it a
00:03:02 lot, you will get used to it and you will think
00:03:08 that it is normal that it sounds normal,
00:03:11 you will know very well how it sounds
00:03:15 but if you do not listen a lot, that will not
00:03:20 happen and I think that if you like
00:03:26 subtitles first, you are not listening
00:03:30 anyway, you are not reading
00:03:34 and when reading I think that  it sounds in our
00:03:40 head the letters sound the
00:03:45 words sound differently it mixes
00:03:49 it mixes with our language not if
00:03:54 your language is English and you
00:03:57 read Spanish by law  l in your head it will
00:04:01 sound a bit like English not
00:04:05 exactly like Spanish so I think
00:04:10 that at the beginning beginner
00:04:14 level intermediate level it is better to
00:04:18 just listen only listen but
00:04:22 listen a lot and then at
00:04:27 higher levels advanced level
00:04:31 when you get used to it when  If you are
00:04:35 used to hearing Spanish,
00:04:38 then if you
00:04:40 can read books, read novels, read
00:04:45 comics, whatever you want,
00:04:48 but when you listen a lot, it will be
00:04:52 easy for you, or it will be easy to listen, or it will be easy to
00:04:56 understand words, even new words, they
00:05:00 will be easy for you at the beginning, not
00:05:05 at the beginning, beginner intermediate level.
00:05:08 It's still a bit difficult
00:05:14 and that's why many people many people
00:05:19 ask me to write the words
00:05:24 they say they say if I read if I read a word and
00:05:28 I remember I remember more and I say
00:05:33 if you remember how to write it you don't
00:05:38 remember how  is pronounced from the sound
00:05:42 you don't remember no you don't remember the
00:05:46 letters abc of course because the
00:05:52 letters sometimes we have the letters in
00:05:55 our head since we were
00:05:58 little that we read abc from then on
00:06:03 inside our head the letters are very good
00:06:06 a b c the letters are there but
00:06:11 the sounds of Spanish are not the sounds
00:06:15 of Spanish you have to listen to them
00:06:19 listen to them a lot and in  the future
00:06:24 after listening to them then yes then the
00:06:27 sounds the sounds of Spanish
00:06:31 will also be very good very well in your
00:06:34 head and when you hear the words
00:06:39 you won't have any problems it's
00:06:43 not necessary it's not necessary it's not necessary to
00:06:46 read the word to remember
00:06:50 that's why when reading the  reading seems to give the
00:06:56 impression it seems that it is easy it is very
00:07:00 easy to remember but I think you are
00:07:04 remembering how to write the
00:07:08 letters
00:07:08 abc and not the sound and with that you are
00:07:13 going to mix the sound of
00:07:17 your language with the sound of Spanish
00:07:21 That's why I think it's better to just
00:07:25 listen listen for a long time and then
00:07:31 later start reading reading
00:07:35 books or reading  whatever you
00:07:40 think,
00:07:41 come on bye
",3
258,"00:00:00 I swear that in my head I was still
00:00:02 thinking no it can't be that he knows me
00:00:06 that he knows who I am it's impossible
00:00:10 Until the man said I really liked your
00:00:14 video talking about things in the United
00:00:18 States
00:00:21 [Music]
00:00:24 Hello everyone how are you my  My name is
00:00:28 Agustina I am from Argentina and today I am going
00:00:34 to tell you something that happened to me
00:00:38 a new experience that I had today and that
00:00:45 I am very very excited
00:00:51 well basically today a person
00:00:57 recognized me saw me and met me
00:01:02 on the street and Wow I am very
00:01:09 surprised no  I can believe it is it's
00:01:13 crazy that a person met me on the
00:01:17 street but I want to tell how it was
00:01:22 exactly so okay let's go with the
00:01:27 story now I am in the center of
00:01:32 Buenos Aires you know that Buenos
00:01:35 Aires is very big so not
00:01:40 all people  They live in the center and I don't
00:01:44 live in the center But I'm here because
00:01:49 I'm working I'm
00:01:54 showing Buenos Aires to some students
00:01:58 from the United States so they
00:02:02 traveled from the United States to
00:02:06 Argentina and  They are my students and I
00:02:10 am
00:02:11 showing them and teaching them about Buenos
00:02:16 Aires so I am in the center of the
00:02:20 city and I am in all the most touristy parts.
00:02:24 But hey, what
00:02:28 exactly happened today in the afternoon we
00:02:32 were walking through the city and
00:02:36 we crossed from one side  On the other, the
00:02:41 most important avenue, 9 de Julio Avenue,
00:02:45 I was super relaxed
00:02:48 working, not explaining things about the
00:02:52 congress and, well, different places in
00:02:57 the city when I hear a person
00:03:00 tell me I know you and I thought he wasn't
00:03:06 talking to me.  to me because I don't know what
00:03:10 person is going to tell me on the street I
00:03:14 know you so I turn around as if to
00:03:19 see and I see that indeed this
00:03:23 man is talking to me and it is seen that the
00:03:28 man saw that I looked
00:03:32 at him as I did  From where I don't understand then I
00:03:37 stayed silent looking at him and the man
00:03:41 told me I know you are the girl from
00:03:46 YouTube and I kind of
00:03:50 thought in my head no no
00:03:52 impossible it must be that the man
00:03:56 confuses me  with another person like no no no
00:04:00 no no no no no he's not talking about me
00:04:02 but at the same time I think Well
00:04:07 okay I make YouTube videos
00:04:10 so it
00:04:12 could be So I look at him and I say Ah
00:04:17 I can't believe it I don't think that for the
00:04:20 whole  the conversation the only thing I said
00:04:23 is no I can't believe it because I really
00:04:27 couldn't believe it and the man
00:04:31 tells me thank you very much your videos are very
00:04:35 useful I learned a lot of Spanish and the man
00:04:40 spoke Spanish well fluent but not
00:04:45 native Yes I could hear an accent  and
00:04:49 that the man was not from Argentina and
00:04:52 Well then he says thank you
00:04:54 very much I learned a lot with your videos and of course I
00:04:58 was like
00:05:00 So I looked at him and said No
00:05:03 thanks to you I can't believe it
00:05:07 always always saying the same thing and
00:05:12 my students looked at me  like
00:05:15 no I mean like what's happening the man
00:05:18 told me he didn't know my name and I
00:05:22 told him Agustina and I swear that in my
00:05:26 head I was still thinking nothing it can't
00:05:30 be like it can't be that he knows me
00:05:33 that he knows who  Who I am is impossible
00:05:37 Until the man said I really liked your
00:05:42 video talking about things in the United
00:05:45 States about the things that surprise you or
00:05:49 that you don't like about the United States and that
00:05:52 's how it
00:05:54 's true,
00:05:55 that is, this man knows me from the channel
00:06:00 YouTube recognized me, he's talking to me
00:06:03 like I started to understand all the things
00:06:07 and it was like Wow and I told him well
00:06:12 that's great Thank you very much and my first
00:06:17 thought was I need to remember
00:06:21 this moment it's like it's impressive
00:06:24 So I asked the man can I
00:06:27 get one  photo with you and it's
00:06:31 kind of the opposite, not typical
00:06:34 Because if you know a youtuber, an
00:06:37 artist, a famous person, I'm not famous
00:06:40 But well, you ask him for a photo and I
00:06:44 asked him for the photo because I needed to
00:06:47 remember the  It was the first time that a person
00:06:51 recognized me on the street, but the man
00:06:54 told me no
00:06:57 for personal reasons and I said, Okay,
00:07:01 okay, okay, we didn't take our picture.
00:07:03 Okay, but he told me that he is from the
00:07:06 United States and that he is  He's in
00:07:08 Argentina and the videos are very
00:07:12 useful for him so nothing in the end he
00:07:15 told me that he didn't want to
00:07:17 steal any more time that I didn't want to stop, I don't know how to
00:07:21 stop myself, I don't take up any more time of my
00:07:24 life and I told him please don't
00:07:28 worry it's all good  and well and nothing
00:07:31 and I said bye Thank you and I left and
00:07:36 obviously my students looked at me
00:07:39 like what what what and Well I
00:07:43 explained that I am part of the
00:07:46 YouTube channel that I am part of
00:07:48 Dreaming Spanish and well I don't know it was very crazy
00:07:52 after that I called  to all the
00:07:56 important people, no, my parents, my boyfriend, they
00:08:00 all didn't recognize me on the
00:08:03 street,
00:08:04 but hey, it's impressive. It's the
00:08:08 first time that this has
00:08:11 actually happened to me.
00:08:20 He told me that he had seen my
00:08:24 Dreaming Spanish videos but it's
00:08:27 different not because on the internet it's like
00:08:29 Oh Wow really Seriously that's great but in
00:08:34 person it's like
00:08:36 I don't know and it's a big coincidence
00:08:40 because which one I don't know what the c  It
00:08:44 looks like we're going to meet in person
00:08:49 and I don't know for me it was always
00:08:53 more obvious to find one of you
00:08:57 a subscriber in another country in the United
00:09:01 States mainly or somewhere
00:09:03 in Europe but in Argentina it's like
00:09:08 very unlikely but well it did happen and
00:09:14 as you can see I am very happy nothing and
00:09:18 many know that since I was very young
00:09:21 that my dream is to be in the world of
00:09:24 entertainment I love to act sing
00:09:28 record videos communicate things and
00:09:32 I always dreamed that people would like
00:09:36 that people enjoy what  what
00:09:39 I do and I don't know all my life I imagined
00:09:44 that I was going to be an actress or a singer but
00:09:47 I think that this is also very very good,
00:09:51 even better in some aspects because
00:09:55 I am helping people in something that
00:09:59 I really like, which are languages  and
00:10:02 also I am sharing my ideas
00:10:05 talking about culture
00:10:08 teaching other things So when
00:10:12 when this man told me how Thank you
00:10:15 your videos are very useful I learned a lot
00:10:19 I felt very  very good and nothing
00:10:23 I really enjoyed it is
00:10:25 something I don't know no I didn't think it would happen
00:10:31 no I didn't think it would happen that a
00:10:34 person was going to stop me on the street and I
00:10:39 don't know I can't believe it I can't believe
00:10:41 the man recognized me Wow  It's a lot,
00:10:46 but well, I wanted to tell you that story
00:10:49 because it's great and well, you know that if
00:10:55 one day you see me on the street or somewhere,
00:10:58 please stop,
00:11:02 talk to me because I love it, I love
00:11:05 meeting people
00:11:08 and talking to you and seeing what you think
00:11:11 of the videos that things are useful that
00:11:14 things are not useful so
00:11:18 please please if you see me stop me talk to me
00:11:23 all you want we can take pictures I
00:11:27 don't know I can give you an autograph although I
00:11:31 don't know what
00:11:33 I'm not for I'm not very famous no no  They will be
00:11:37 able to sell the autograph to have more
00:11:40 money, but yes. Please, I want you to
00:11:44 know that if you ever see me, talk
00:11:46 to me that I am good, I swear I am good and

00:11:54 wanted to thank you all for your support.
00:11:56 that they give not only to me but also to the

00:12:03 see that people enjoy the videos
00:12:06 and that people are
00:12:08 surprised and nothing I think that seeing someone
00:12:10 in person is one of those experiences
00:12:13 that makes you understand understand
00:12:18 Actually there are people who watch the
00:12:21 videos and who have opinions and who
00:12:24 like it so well nothing I'm very happy

00:00:05 Hello guys how are you my name is
00:00:07 Justin and welcome to another video
00:00:10 this time we are with this beautiful
00:00:13 lady named Sofía Hello guys
00:00:17 how are you Thank you very much Justin here
00:00:20 ready to play for a while
00:00:23 That's right that's the way it's been played ever  This
00:00:26 game is a fairly typical game
00:00:30 for family parties, it's a very fun game, that's
00:00:33 definitely the
00:00:35 way it is. If today we are going to record this
00:00:39 Round of guess the character where,
00:00:42 well, we will each have to
00:00:44 guess a character and whoever does it
00:00:47 In the fewest number of questions, he will
00:00:49 go to the next round and he will play
00:00:51 with whoever has won between Andrea and
00:00:55 Alma,
00:00:57 we are going to spend a very pleasant time
00:01:00 trying to decipher the character of
00:01:02 each person. That's right, we're going to have fun.
00:01:09 little are quite simple
00:01:11 we can only ask yes and no questions And
00:01:14 besides that if you ask
00:01:17 specifically for a character it also
00:01:19 counts as a question
00:01:23 I think I think Bue  I don't think I do
00:01:26 n't think there are more rules I think it's
00:01:27 quite simple no
00:01:33 good perfect Yes yes We hope that
00:01:36 we both do well
00:01:38 We're going to have fun that's the important thing Do
00:01:43 you want to start by asking yourself
00:01:46 Yes maybe I'll start  I think it's good,
00:01:48 but before I prepared something for you,
00:01:54 I don't know why it occurred to me to do
00:01:56 this surprises
00:02:01 I thought of several characters and I couldn't
00:02:04 decide So I said good because
00:02:07 Sofia doesn't Choose the character herself who is
00:02:10 going to guess So I
00:02:12 need you to choose a number between  the
00:02:15 1 the 2 and the 3 and well this you choose your
00:02:20 destiny and Well then at the end when you
00:02:22 guess effectively I show to the
00:02:24 camera that it was the character I have it
00:02:26 here on a piece of paper
00:02:29 one two or three
00:02:34 good Ok
00:02:39 in fact I think it is the  easier for
00:02:41 you so I think you chose well
00:02:45 then well let's see let's start
00:02:48 that's right you can ask now
00:02:53 is he a
00:02:55 flesh and blood human character yes he
00:03:00 is a woman yes he
00:03:05 is a
00:03:07 r character  eal that is, it is not a cartoon
00:03:11 yes excellent it is an actress yes
00:03:18 Ok Oh God not very well
00:03:24 Ok excellent she is an actress from
00:03:29 the American continent
00:03:30 yes from the United States yes
00:03:35 mmm okay okay okay okay okay we are going well
00:03:39 well on our way
00:03:43 excellent no no
00:03:48 that black hair  yes she
00:03:52 's latina no
00:03:57 normally dramatic
00:04:01 movies she doesn't make movies
00:04:06 no I mean mainly like
00:04:09 comedy no well you know that all
00:04:11 movies can have some comedy
00:04:14 but it's not like I mean it's not like it
00:04:16 's a movie you know one of those
00:04:18 Adam's  sandler what are they For laughs not like that
00:04:21 no Ok she's over 30 yes I'm
00:04:27 sure she's over 30 Ok she's
00:04:30 older she
00:04:32 's probably around that
00:04:35 age Maybe she's around 36 7 8 9 Ok Oh
00:04:42 my god Ok she's an actress  American
00:04:44 who has won an Oscar No, he hasn't
00:04:50 won an Oscar Ok, he's more popular, he's
00:04:55 popular, Pearl in series Yes, to give you
00:04:59 a little help,
00:05:02 most of his popularity
00:05:05 comes from a series, it's not like he's alone  or
00:05:07 do that but it comes as mainly
00:05:09 for a series
00:05:11 a series the series is old define
00:05:15 let's define old it has
00:05:23 yes the series Friends no the series is sex
00:05:27 on the city no again me today my lack
00:05:30 of culture with television and I think it
00:05:33 has to do  with series Okay
00:05:36 I am I am 100% sure that you must
00:05:40 know this actress
00:05:42 So she is an American actress in
00:05:46 her 30s or 40s or so the period
00:05:50 that she is famous specifically for a
00:05:54 series that has black hair is not
00:05:57 Afro-descendant or Latina
00:06:03 today you killed me I don't know  I ca
00:06:05 n't count that I can't count it as a question
00:06:07 that was another of the rules yes no You
00:06:09 can't answer you can't
00:06:11 count it as a question so does she
00:06:17 have a husband or boyfriend
00:06:21 Yes I mean at some point
00:06:24 I found out that yes but hey you know  What
00:06:26 do you know they can get divorced and but if at
00:06:29 some point I do think so
00:06:36 I
00:06:38 'm not stagnant I started well but I've already
00:06:42 stagnated yes
00:06:43 capable capable if you find out how his
00:06:48 his race his ethnicity you can head out or  A
00:06:52 little bit more OK, so that gives me the
00:06:54 clue that maybe it's not
00:06:58 like she has an ethnic group, not
00:07:01 OK, but she's an actress, that is,
00:07:06 not as an ethnic group, but you asked about an
00:07:09 Afro-descendant Latina, you were able to
00:07:11 identify a characteristic
00:07:16 related to that.  You locate it super
00:07:18 fast really
00:07:20 Zendaya it is not true not
00:07:23 the series had to do with
00:07:26 How the series had to do
00:07:31 with action not for which it is famous not
00:07:36 with daily life
00:07:45 Oh no Let's see then trying to find out
00:07:48 Where
00:07:50 where did this series show
00:07:54 me  It helps a lot because I tell you I don't watch
00:07:57 series so let's see let's see
00:07:59 let's see if maybe maybe the
00:08:02 series were made in the United States
00:08:03 Well I'm not going to tell you as a
00:08:05 question because if I told you I was
00:08:07 American then let's say  Yes, I
00:08:10 mean, if they did it there,
00:08:15 I
00:08:18 can't have a clue.
00:08:20 Well, I'm going to give you a clue like this,
00:08:24 a joker, the series is from Disney Channel
00:08:30 and right now it
00:08:32 's Selena Gomez, no,
00:08:35 no, no, Selena Gomez has, we're going to say
00:08:39 that in al  Some time ago, the
00:08:41 Latina trend said yes to the
00:08:44 black-haired question, the series is
00:08:48 from Disney Channel Vanessa Hudgens
00:08:53 Vanessa Hudgens was in a High
00:08:56 School Musical series, no, but a series of
00:08:59 films, not a series,
00:09:01 a series of films, no, no,  In other words,
00:09:05 you are saying High School Musical was
00:09:07 a series of movies and I mean
00:09:09 a series series
00:09:11 that a Disney series
00:09:15 My God Holy the series was Hannah
00:09:19 Montana no but that question either
00:09:22 I am already 100% sure that the other series
00:09:24 Yes  You know the series, it was me, I
00:09:27 'm also sure that I do know it,
00:09:29 just right now my memory is not giving me the
00:09:31 ability to guess which series is the one
00:09:35 that appears, that person is an actress
00:09:37 over 30 years of age at this moment,
00:09:40 obviously she is over 30 years of age at that
00:09:42 time.  In other words, imagine that more
00:09:45 than 10 years ago he had a more youthful role of
00:09:48 course and he has black hair the series
00:09:52 were here twins in action yes the
00:09:56 artist
00:09:57 yes
00:09:59 [Laughter]
00:10:02 okay Okay you saw this you know  Did you know the name
00:10:05 of the actress Well here I am going
00:10:14 to do all the Disney series
00:10:16 simply at this moment my brain
00:10:18 was not giving me any more but Ok
00:10:22 I did it Yes that's why I was sure because
00:10:24 at some point you told me that you
00:10:26 liked it a lot and you were a  girl Disney
00:10:28 Channel and the only character of the three
00:10:31 related to Disney Channel was the
00:10:33 one you chose I'm going to show it on the
00:10:35 camera I'm going to try to make it look
00:10:37 Good I'm here showing it good and
00:10:40 Brenda Song says
00:10:42 out of curiosity I can know what
00:10:44 the others were  two characters
00:10:46 no because how can I pass
00:10:50 the next round maybe I can use them in the next
00:10:52 round
00:10:53 Ok excellent
00:10:56 Well, I already have I managed to guess they
00:11:01 are a bit complicated because I get
00:11:03 very close to the world in these
00:11:05 games But well
00:11:07 not the same No you didn't  You didn't do it
00:11:10 wrong,
00:11:11 well, then I got stuck a little later,
00:11:14 as I was finding the
00:11:15 thread again and now because Exactly, in
00:11:18 the end you asked 30 questions
00:11:21 30 Exactly
00:11:24 Perfect perf  ecto we are going to try to
00:11:26 improve that number Well well
00:11:31 no but you have to follow the video
00:11:33 Exactly
00:11:37 Well I will start by asking you is this
00:11:41 character real yes Ok
00:11:46 this this character is a woman he is not an
00:11:52 actor
00:11:54 no Ok he
00:11:56 is a singer
00:11:59 ok He is not an actor or a singer
00:12:05 I am going too  to write the name here on my
00:12:07 blackboard so they can see that it's not
00:12:09 cheating or they don't
00:12:17 change the person Dale is a politician
00:12:22 Ok he's
00:12:25 going to win but well
00:12:29 let's see let's see he's a politician
00:12:32 from the American continent
00:12:35 of the United States he
00:12:39 's a  president
00:12:42 Ok he
00:12:44 's a recent president one of the
00:12:48 last five
00:12:50 Oh god he's Barack Obama
00:12:57 omg Holy that was too fast
00:13:00 I think you obviously eliminated me
00:13:03 if I know only 10 questions
00:13:11 literally fast all of them
00:13:15 no at first no because I sort of got lost
00:13:18 I said ok because  He's not famous but he
00:13:20 's an actor or a singer, that is, and he
00:13:23 reduces a lot and what I was thinking
00:13:25 is good if he's not a politician, then
00:13:28 I do have to think more because if
00:13:30 he isn't  If I were a politician, I would have to
00:13:32 do I don't know something like a painter, a
00:13:35 writer, a dancer, and that's more
00:13:37 difficult to find, we
00:13:39 don't know if you know about culture
00:13:42 or that. The truth is that I'm not very
00:13:44 steeped in the culture of  everyone
00:13:47 but look if I thought of Barack Obama I thought
00:13:50 it was going to be super difficult according to me
00:13:51 but well I see that it was not super difficult
00:13:54 not this guy when he is political and capable
00:13:58 of the United States capable if I had
00:13:59 put on one from Mexico
00:14:03 it is about  that you suffer and it had to
00:14:06 be a politician who was somewhat
00:14:08 known worldwide So yes, he was
00:14:11 chosen
00:14:13 Well, very well, thank you, thank you Well,
00:14:20 just this once, that's right, there will be time
00:14:23 for a rematch, let's see if
00:14:27 we both improve
00:14:32 But I hope
00:14:34 That's how it is, that's how it is, and well, Sofía, I don't know
00:14:39 if you want to say something else to the boys.
00:14:41 Yes, well, obviously we're going to be
00:14:44 trying to improve. We're not going to be
00:14:46 trying to improve.
00:14:52 Well, if they use new games, it
00:14:54 would be great if they proposed games
00:14:56 that can be made as well as
00:14:57 interactive, I'll be very cool, but they'll
00:15:00 see that we'll be seeing each other here
00:15:01 very often
00:15:02 Exactly, now, now, Sofia and all the
00:15:06 teachers are going to be a little longer
00:15:08 followed in all the Dreaming
00:15:11 Spanish networks And as she says if they have
00:15:13 proposals for more games it would be very cool
00:15:16 to see if we all cheer up and maybe
00:15:19 we do a tournament of some other game
00:15:20 too right Exactly that would be very
00:15:23 cool to start I don't know we see that that  What
00:15:27 can be done and I think it would also be a
00:15:28 very cool activity No Yes, that's the way it is, that's
00:15:32 excellent,
00:15:33 Sofía, thanks for recording this
00:15:36 video with me. Thank you very much for the
00:15:38 call and I hope to see you soon in a
00:15:41 next video talking about
00:15:42 anything else Sure Thank you very much  you

00:15:47 love these games and nothing congratulations

097,"00:00:00 Hello, today I'm going to show you my apartment. We're going
00:00:05 to see what my apartment is like. My apartment is a
00:00:15 studio. I live in a studio. A studio is
00:00:19 an apartment that only
00:00:21 has one room.
00:00:27 It's
00:00:30 separate
00:00:31 and well, welcome, this is my apartment and I
00:00:34 study, I live here with my girlfriend,
00:00:38 we both live and we've been living here since
00:00:41 December. I think it's been about six
00:00:44 months or so, so this corner is
00:00:49 the studio.
00:00:51 it's where i work it's
00:00:54 my work desk my work table
00:00:56 and i work here every day
00:00:59 with the computer now i put
00:01:02 things away because i just shot the
00:01:05 video
00:01:06 the other video on how to shoot videos
00:01:10 how he shot the videos i don't normally
00:01:12 have the computers on  plural I have
00:01:16 several computers two I have two two
00:01:19 laptops and well I work here
00:01:24 here in this corner
00:01:27 and well the lights I have the lights like this
00:01:30 so that it can be seen to illuminate a
00:01:31 the room a little more because in this
00:01:33 room there is not much light there are
00:01:35 only two lamps the lamps
00:01:38 are not very strong they are not very powerful
00:01:40 well we have lamps on the
00:01:43 bedside table as well but they are also not
00:01:45 very powerful lamps and it has the
00:01:48 balcony but also  It's not very big and
00:01:51 there isn't much light, not much light comes in
00:01:54 either through the balcony through
00:01:56 the window,
00:01:58 so
00:02:01 here in the entrance is the
00:02:05 shoe cabinet the shoes are here
00:02:08 here is the closet our closet that's
00:02:11 good of course it's a third  either me or
00:02:14 two thirds of my girlfriend
00:02:17 [Music]
00:02:19 I don't know we have a small sofa the
00:02:23 cheapest sofa I think it was the cheapest the
00:02:25 cheapest from ikea or the second
00:02:27 cheapest a good one a very very
00:02:30 simple sofa very simple but what is it
00:02:32 enough for two people
00:02:35 we have fans one fan and two
00:02:38 fans because it's hot it's
00:02:42 quite hot in thailand wait I have
00:02:44 the air
00:02:45 I have the air conditioner on and
00:02:47 it's pretty  in the face of noise I hope that now you can
00:02:49 tell me better and if we have two
00:02:52 fans
00:02:54 there is also an air
00:02:56 conditioning machine a piece of
00:02:58 air conditioning machine is quite large it
00:03:01 is like semi industrial but well it is
00:03:04 the machine that was there I do not use it much
00:03:07 I do not like it very much  the air conditioning
00:03:09 because it made my throat dry
00:03:12 but now in summer the truth
00:03:15 is that it is very hot and sometimes I put it
00:03:18 on especially when I am recording videos
00:03:20 I put it on for a while I put it on a bit and
00:03:23 then when recording the video I stop it so
00:03:25 that I don't know  listen to the noise no and sometimes well
00:03:28 before going to sleep we have to
00:03:31 sleep first well I put it on we put it on for
00:03:33 a while and that way the room cools down a bit
00:03:35 and it's easier later to sleep
00:03:39 we have well I have here
00:03:44 some of these carpeted pieces that are
00:03:46 like a  puzzle not carpet a piece of
00:03:49 carpet and I put this recently I use it
00:03:52 for when when I use virtual reality I
00:03:55 normally use this space here to
00:03:58 play to play virtual reality  With
00:04:01 the quests, I bought the quests and
00:04:05 I put them on. I don't put myself here, well, to
00:04:08 play shooting, hitting shots, cutting things, it's
00:04:12 not a game, well, I use this
00:04:14 space and with the carpet, it helps me to
00:04:18 know when I'm  when I have left
00:04:20 when I have left the playing area
00:04:22 because you can see it inside when you are
00:04:25 playing you see when you reach the limit but it
00:04:28 also helps if I am, for example,
00:04:30 I am walking backwards well when
00:04:32 when my feet leave the carpet well
00:04:35 then  I know I'm too
00:04:38 far no I don't have to keep
00:04:40 walking
00:04:43 well here we have a
00:04:46 game the gene won that he likes
00:04:49 my girlfriend quite likes this this game
00:04:51 so we play we play from time to
00:04:53 time
00:04:56 and here well we have a piece of furniture with a
00:04:58 lot of things everything  what we don't know
00:05:01 where to put it well it goes here not also
00:05:05 the cable drawer here with all the
00:05:08 cables I don't know where to put it goes
00:05:10 everything goes here
00:05:13 the table the table we use mostly for
00:05:16 breakfast for dinner good  or me to eat
00:05:19 I normally eat here at home
00:05:21 so we use this table and now I have
00:05:25 things here normally these things are
00:05:28 on the desk now I have put it
00:05:30 here because before I have been recording the
00:05:33 video on how to record videos how I use
00:05:35 the studio no but this  yes, it's
00:05:39 normally here this is a support it
00:05:43 's a support for the mobile phone just put
00:05:46 the mobile like this and when we
00:05:49 're having breakfast or we're having dinner well
00:05:51 we put some series here a movie
00:05:54 and we watch it together not with my girlfriend
00:05:59 we have 2 reuters because well two better
00:06:01 I don't know which one I don't know because we have two
00:06:03 routers it's because of the rate we took a
00:06:05 rate I wanted a rate that had
00:06:07 good speed and it was like a rate
00:06:10 to play video games so there is a
00:06:12 router the normal router and the router to
00:06:14 play video games that I don't play  not only
00:06:17 play a lot of online games but well it's
00:06:20 what came and since we don't have space
00:06:22 they are here one on top of the other like
00:06:24 good friends the routers
00:06:28 we have  the fridge a pretty small fridge
00:06:31 quite bad especially because it is a
00:06:35 freezer the freezer door is
00:06:39 non-existent there is no
00:06:42 freezer door therefore the
00:06:44 things in the freezer do not freeze and
00:06:47 the things that are outside the freezer
00:06:49 here in the  door yes they freeze what
00:06:52 will you say wow wow funny no well if it doesn't
00:06:55 work very well enough to make
00:06:57 and ice the ice so it more or
00:07:00 less freezes but if you put some ice cream or
00:07:04 bread or something it doesn't really freeze well
00:07:07 there is no left no left  hard we don't have many
00:07:09 things in the fridge we have a
00:07:13 ham egg that my mother brought ham ham
00:07:16 quoted from spain' good ham
00:07:19 serrano ham is very tasty
00:07:21 and normally we have some fresh vegetables
00:07:24 and some fruit usually there is fruit
00:07:27 now there is no left we have  finished now
00:07:29 but there is usually some fruit but you can
00:07:32 see that we don't have many many things
00:07:35 not only we usually cook at home
00:07:38 because the only way we have to
00:07:41 cook is with this is  using this and
00:07:45 this is an electric casserole if it's a
00:07:48 casserole a casserole is like a
00:07:51 frying pan but a little deeper not a little
00:07:53 deeper basically it's this and here well
00:07:56 it heats it up it has a cord it's
00:07:59 electric and good it works it can be used
00:08:02 but normally  when we use it is
00:08:06 to boil eggs or to make
00:08:10 instant noodles instant noodles
00:08:13 like Japanese noodles
00:08:17 no sometimes we cook with a little water
00:08:19 we put some water and maybe a little
00:08:21 vegetables and tuna for example or some other
00:08:24 fish and sometimes it  we have used but
00:08:27 we don't usually use it we don't use it much
00:08:31 so well here in this cabinet
00:08:33 we do have the dishes and oil
00:08:37 and there is honey and vinegar and such but well
00:08:41 we don't have many things there is
00:08:42 n't even a sink to wash
00:08:44 the dishes we have to wash the dishes
00:08:47 in the bathroom that now I will show you the
00:08:49 bathroom
00:08:51 here we have the bed a double bed but
00:08:54 not only a double bed it is a
00:08:56 very wide bone bed very very wide I think
00:08:59 never in my  In my life I have had a bed that
00:09:02 wide it is very very wide one meter I think
00:09:06 it is a meter 90 I would say it is a meter
00:09:08 90 well there is a lot a lot of space the
00:09:12 mattress is hard it is quite hard and I
00:09:15 like I like that it is hard especially
00:09:17 here in  thailand because if it's soft
00:09:21 and you sink it's very hot the mattress makes you very
00:09:24 hot and since it's hard
00:09:28 you stay on the surface you
00:09:30 stay flat and it's cooler the mattress doesn't get
00:09:32 so hot
00:09:37 and well
00:09:39 things from my girlfriend some
00:09:42 I gave it to him at least
00:09:45 one pub, this one and Mr. Bean's,
00:09:50 I
00:09:52 gave it to him, and this one, Micky Mronz, a boy gave it to him.
00:10:05 Well, you can play street fighter
00:10:08 or maybe some more, some more modern game, well,
00:10:11 a boy there are the hook machines,
00:10:14 not the machines that he grabs,
00:10:17 you can take a doll and boom and win the
00:10:19 doll and this boy, well, he won a doll, he
00:10:22 won a mickey mouse and he  he gave it to my
00:10:25 girlfriend because the guy maybe didn't have a
00:10:27 girlfriend and he gave it to her
00:10:31 there is a small one a small balcony there is a
00:10:35 balcony he quoted here
00:10:37 a balcony he quoted where is the
00:10:40 air conditioning machine when the air
00:10:41 conditioning is on here you
00:10:44 can't be there  you die you would die if you
00:10:47 were here because of the heat it is
00:10:49 unbearable but now it is not
00:10:52 on and now there are clothes here that
00:10:54 are drying today it is raining it was
00:10:57 raining very hard before but hey I have
00:10:59 separated the clothes a bit he has brought them
00:11:01 here and not like that  it gets wet we have
00:11:04 a washing machine a new washing machine a type of
00:11:07 washing machine that I have never seen in Spain
00:11:10 because here you go here you have space
00:11:14 to wash clothes but
00:11:18 here you have a spin dryer it has a
00:11:22 spin dryer that spins very fast
00:11:24 to dry to dry the clothes that is  It does not
00:11:27 dry completely but it removes a
00:11:30 lot of water, a lot of the water that it
00:11:33 carries, well, it does not remove it and the part where
00:11:36 the beans are, well, you have to fill in
00:11:39 the water you have  what to bring put water in
00:11:43 here fill it up and good when you put the
00:11:46 soap and such and it has at the bottom yes
00:11:50 it spins yes at least
00:11:53 it spins you don't have to spin it by
00:11:56 hand it spins it but only at the base
00:11:58 the base gives  laps and yes, it stirs but
00:12:01 it was already basically stirring, that is, it
00:12:04 is not a washing machine, it is a stirrer,
00:12:06 all it does is stir and then if
00:12:09 spinning is not the only thing, the only thing that
00:12:11 makes it clear, it does not even have hot water, it does not
00:12:14 heat the water
00:12:17 and well  that's it this is our mini
00:12:19 terrace
00:12:21 like our mini balcony as you can
00:12:23 imagine well we don't use this balcony
00:12:25 we don't go out to eat or have a drink on the
00:12:29 balcony because it's tiny
00:12:33 and this is the sink
00:12:36 and in the sink we have
00:12:40 hand soap and soap  for the dishes and a
00:12:42 scourer a scourer for the dishes
00:12:45 because here we wash the dishes too and
00:12:48 well there the toilet that the toilet well it
00:12:52 's a normal toilet in
00:12:54 Thailand they have this they have
00:12:57 the hose that doesn't go very well it goes m  oops,
00:13:00 it's for the ass, it
00:13:02 's for wiping your ass for
00:13:04 after pooping, well, you clean your ass,
00:13:06 but it works very well for me to wash, to
00:13:09 clean, to clean the toilet, to clean the
00:13:12 shower, I don't find it very very useful, good
00:13:16 for the ass too  It also leaves your
00:13:17 ass very clean
00:13:19 and we have a shower here, a shower that's
00:13:23 good, well,
00:13:25 the sinks in Thailand are made
00:13:28 to get wet, the entire floor can get
00:13:30 wet, so it's also easy to clean, it
00:13:34 's quite easy to clean, and well, the
00:13:37 shower doesn't have a tray.  The shower is not a
00:13:40 separate object like that, but rather it is
00:13:42 part of the sink itself. There is a step, a
00:13:44 small step, and well, inside, I was taking a
00:13:47 shower, and apart from that, well, there is
00:13:51 nothing else, very, very interesting, the
00:13:53 water heater that in Thailand they
00:13:56 normally have.  These mini
00:13:58 electric water heaters that
00:14:00 you can choose the temperature and it heats
00:14:04 the water instantly heats the
00:14:06 water at the moment when you are going
00:14:08 to use it because you don't have to heat it.  e
00:14:10 wait for you it does not have a tank it does not have
00:14:13 a large tank that has to
00:14:15 heat up you have to wait for it to
00:14:17 heat up it is instantaneous it works
00:14:20 instantly I forgot to say that
00:14:23 I also have a projector
00:14:26 I have a projector to watch movies and
00:14:29 I don't know how long ago  I
00:14:31 've had it for more than 10 years and I've had the
00:14:33 projector and sometimes, well, we project
00:14:36 movies on the wall and we watch movies
00:14:38 like this in a fairly large room and it's the cool
00:14:43 floor to have a projector
00:14:45 apart from that, look, there was this in the
00:14:48 room, I don't know if this is  normal or not
00:14:52 I think that in the other apartments where I have
00:14:54 been living in Thailand I think there
00:14:57 was not this
00:14:59 but there is an anti-smoke mask there is a
00:15:02 mask a mask to put on your
00:15:04 face in case there is a fire if there is fire
00:15:07 and there is smoke and you cannot  you can't
00:15:10 breathe well you can put on the mask
00:15:13 and so you can breathe like this you don't swallow smoke
00:15:15 not when there's a fire that's fine it
00:15:18 's fine to have it I hadn't seen
00:15:21 anywhere any p  iso that I had a
00:15:24 fire mask for the smoke
00:15:28 well that's it I think I have more or less
00:15:31 explained everything that is in the apartment
00:15:34 especially everything interesting everything
00:15:37 that seems to me to be I don't know what is
00:15:39 interesting that is peculiar and
00:15:42 characteristic  especially the things that
00:15:44 are different with Spain no
00:15:48 and well thanks for watching the video and don't
00:15:52 forget that we have daily
00:15:55 and intermediate videos that if you go to homeland or
00:15:58 sign up to receive a new video
00:16:01 every day okay come see you later
00:16:09 [Music  ]

00:00:55 well, let it be clear that I like to eat,
00:00:58 yes, I do, but I do
00:01:00 n't like cooking what I like to cook, but cooking is a
00:01:03 lot, I think, but because there are dishes that
00:01:05 I prefer that I prefer to cook less myself.
00:01:08 Why not because I'm a stickler and
00:01:10 I didn't like many dishes depending on how they
00:01:13 were cooked for me. Okay, do you like to eat what
00:01:15 you cook, it's better if I get tired of
00:01:18 the restaurant food?
00:01:23 ro and pre-cooked food and such is not
00:01:26 very good
00:01:29 okay then you don't like to cook but
00:01:32 eat yes of course then what do you
00:01:38 like what is traditional from day to day well
00:01:42 sautéed vegetables with a kind of
00:01:44 ratatouille of aubergines
00:01:49 this what scenes peppers onions
00:01:51 sautéed zucchini soldiers  and another
00:01:57 small one and sautéed later you can
00:02:00 put the ratatouille I don't know what it has
00:02:03 exactly because it is a Manchego dish
00:02:05 but I make my adaptation so
00:02:06 I put it there then he makes the sautéed vegetables
00:02:10 if it is one in a pan with a
00:02:13 little oil
00:02:18 a little more  tablespoons about three
00:02:21 tablespoons and it's sautéed it's the pan
00:02:26 okay and it gives it some flavor
00:02:30 it comes out you can put it without salt and
00:02:33 then you can put some kind
00:02:35 of spices with which are the
00:02:38 spices we normally use because we don't use
00:02:40 curry
00:02:42 but  In this dish, as it is a dish that
00:02:44 is not a typical dish, but rather a mixture
00:02:48 that I have made, well, I can put what
00:02:49 happened, above all, what I put the most is
00:02:51 com  ino cumin combines in this type
00:02:54 that cumin is used a lot in
00:02:57 North African food yes and in Spain also
00:02:59 in Extremadura it is used in some
00:03:03 water chorizos some sausages but it
00:03:06 is not very typical in food in
00:03:08 Spanish food dishes no  Not in Extremadura
00:03:10 like this because some dish that
00:03:12 the people of Extremadura have taught me isn't worth
00:03:15 your father's family. They take it with wine in
00:03:18 Extremadura, which is in the west where
00:03:21 the west of Spain touches Portugal,
00:03:24 so they use cumin because cumin is
00:03:26 a spice.  so quite compare
00:03:29 this but this kind of ratatouille yes and
00:03:33 some typical dish from Spain the
00:03:35 typical dishes from Spain the ones I like to
00:03:37 make the most because I can't stand how they cook them
00:03:40 outside it's very rare to find someone
00:03:42 who cooks a good paella the paella
00:03:44 that does it  Well, that they do it well or that they
00:03:46 do it the way I like it, it's difficult
00:03:48 sometimes I go somewhere because I'm
00:03:50 excited to eat a paella and it always disappoints me. I
00:03:52 'm new to them, they
00:03:54 can  n be very different no yes they can
00:03:57 be very dry there is a lot of
00:03:59 liquid a lot of water they can be fish
00:04:02 or meat but I am almost always
00:04:05 disappointed
00:04:07 after another dish that you like you like to
00:04:09 eat
00:04:10 another dish that I do not like outside
00:04:13 anywhere are cannelloni
00:04:19 The cannelloni are very good,
00:04:23 a commune, sheets, and pasta, but
00:04:26 rolled up like a roll and which
00:04:29 has meat inside, a stir-fry
00:04:32 of different types of meat, veal, chicken, meat
00:04:34 with tomato, tomato, onion, without much
00:04:38 fried, and well, I have my trick, but
00:04:40 I'm not going to say it.  no no it is not the
00:04:43 secret recipe more secret than coca-cola
00:04:46 so the gutter if it is later covered
00:04:50 with ham my condolences what a
00:04:53 sauce is is a sauce that I
00:04:56 am going to say this because many
00:04:58 cooks do it to  I put onion
00:05:00 onion in the béchamel and I don't make it with butter
00:05:02 lake with oil with oil you don't do it
00:05:04 with butter I always do it with
00:05:06 béchamel butter
00:05:08 I think that in many recipes use
00:05:10 butter  equilla is that the authentic béchamel
00:05:12 that I don't know if it's from Italy or
00:05:14 France what's from France only
00:05:16 French I don't know if I think it's French
00:05:19 I think it goes without onion but they
00:05:21 taught me how to make it with onion the
00:05:22 cooks of my  hospital
00:05:25 I love it and you use olive oil
00:05:29 because I have adapted the diet to the
00:05:33 healthy Mediterranean diet
00:05:40 then it is also covered with cheese
00:05:43 grated cheese developed and baked it is not
00:05:46 baked au gratin baked
00:05:48 those cannelloni you have to try them in
00:05:51 the future  if a restaurant opens or I'll let you
00:05:56 know I tasted the other dish if another dish that
00:05:59 is also very famous and it's also
00:06:00 hard for me to find outside that I like
00:06:03 are croquettes
00:06:04 I hope you're also very famous
00:06:05 and
00:06:09 I'm croquettes I'm less fussy about
00:06:11 croquettes  I like them a lot, and
00:06:14 I may also like them a little better
00:06:15 than cannelloni and the beach,
00:06:18 yes, unless they are one of those dwarf ones,
00:06:21 there are very small
00:06:23 frozen croquettes that  And if they buy those I don't find
00:06:26 it very funny but if they are homemade they
00:06:29 are made by them most of them I
00:06:31 like the ones I make I also like them
00:06:34 and sometimes I get a lot of exercise and
00:06:36 ferb people if they come out they don't come out they don't always come out the
00:06:39 same but they are good
00:06:41 and think of any secret to make the
00:06:43 roquetas cakes it is not very difficult I
00:06:46 remember when I had to explain it to you from a
00:06:47 distance that this is very difficult the
00:06:49 croquettes have because you have to
00:06:51 leave a texture that is not too
00:06:53 tight because if not then the croquette
00:06:56 or  Either so that you can handle the dough well, there
00:06:58 should be a lot of flour, but
00:07:00 afterward the croquette is not good enough time to
00:07:01 speak of
00:07:02 that they are soft, the croquettes
00:07:04 also take as once it
00:07:08 is thicker and if you put a lot of flour of
00:07:11 course then it is very
00:07:15 dry you make the croquette  well because
00:07:17 your hands don't get caught but
00:07:19 after the croquette to taste flour
00:07:23 maybe it has very little very little flour it's
00:07:25 juicy it's soft and but you
00:07:28 can  It's not hard to
00:07:31 shape it, of course, it's more difficult, you have to
00:07:33 look for the point on the scale, the amount
00:07:35 of flour, yes, but the croquettes are very good.
00:07:41 There is also a dish that you learned
00:07:46 recently in recent years that
00:07:48 you didn't make when I was little, but that
00:07:51 now  It stays very, very well, it's very
00:07:53 good, yes, I discovered it when they
00:07:57 had Japan, I lived in Happens and
00:07:59 2000, between 2010 and
00:08:03 after two nerves because I had tried to
00:08:05 do it before and it didn't look good.
00:08:08 a catalan dish is a
00:08:11 typical catalan dish then
00:08:13 explaining i remember i told you that i
00:08:16 had learned to make it with this base in
00:08:17 japan and i had to cook it for you when i was
00:08:20 there in japan you lived you should go
00:08:23 see one in japan in japan and  of kitchens
00:08:25 but he cooked it there in Japan
00:08:26 yes yes there you tried it and I also find it
00:08:28 very good and it is not difficult to
00:08:30 find a recipe on the internet and
00:08:33 the secret is very easy  It is in that explaining
00:08:36 the veal meat that frying it with
00:08:38 flour nothing turned and turned very little
00:08:41 worth the fricandó that it has takes
00:08:43 veal or
00:08:45 cow veal they have to cut it very
00:08:49 finely you put it with flour and the cold ones in
00:08:52 oil quite very hot  pim pim pam
00:08:56 round and round and round
00:09:01 then you make a
00:09:04 tomato sauce tomato and onion also in a frying pan
00:09:07 tomato onion
00:09:08 [Music]
00:09:09 and when it's almost done you put the meat
00:09:12 and you put water and mushrooms and mushrooms by themselves
00:09:17 because that's the other  Ingredient that
00:09:19 gives it many, they fought the mushrooms there are
00:09:22 different types of mushrooms but I think that
00:09:24 the one that is read
00:09:28 the most is not the most original I think it was
00:09:31 gullible I think Alfredo is not called if it
00:09:38 is a Catalan name but we do not know
00:09:40 what it is called  very aromatic,
00:09:45 any mushroom that makes a lot of aroma that
00:09:48 has flavor can do well and if not you can add
00:09:50 mushrooms if it is not the season for mushrooms
00:09:53 they are also good it
00:09:59 is very good the truth is that it is
00:10:03 very successful
00:10:04 to the guests is our 8 is that in
00:10:08 reality you say that I am a very good
00:10:09 cook but what happens is that I
00:10:11 cheat because when people come
00:10:13 I always make those same dishes that I already know that they turn
00:10:15 out well for me, the others do not do what I am
00:10:17 not invited to do  yes, well, the others,
00:10:20 maybe some also work out well for me, but
00:10:21 I will always bet on the safe one,
00:10:25 the one that I know will turn out
00:10:27 well, but you like it, you like to
00:10:29 feed other people and that they are happy
00:10:32 without class  and so give him your weight
00:10:35 after the works are taken away like taking
00:10:37 food from mothers of children because
00:10:44 when his sister comes to eat she already
00:10:46 comes with her own paper
00:10:54 bags so that later she doesn't have my tupperware at home so she comes with her
00:10:57 own tapes
00:10:58 well  Well, thank you, thank you for
00:11:01 telling us about your favorite dishes and you
00:11:04 also try them if you find a
00:11:07 restaurant or if you go to Spain- and you have
00:11:10 the opportunity to try these dishes.
00:11:13 I recommend it, they weren't as good as
00:11:16 the ones that  What does my mother do but something is something

202,"00:00:00 In this video I am going to talk to you about one of
00:00:04 the strangest territories of the
00:00:07 Iberian Peninsula
00:00:11 [Music]
00:00:14 In this video I am going to talk to you about
00:00:18 Gibraltar
00:00:20 Gibraltar is a British territory that
00:00:24 is located within the Iberian Peninsula. It
00:00:27 is not a Spanish territory, it is
00:00:32 a territory  which belongs to great
00:00:34 britain
00:00:35 and is located to the south of the
00:00:39 iberian peninsula' in the bay of algeciras
00:00:45 and if you want to go to gibraltar from spain
00:00:49 you must go to the city of la línea de
00:00:53 la concepción
00:00:54 in la línea de la concepción there is a
00:00:57 border that you must  cross if you want to go
00:01:01 to gibraltar and of course to cross
00:01:05 that border you have to show your
00:01:08 passport also if you want to go from
00:01:12 gibraltar to spain you have to cross
00:01:15 that border and show your passport and
00:01:19 gibraltar is a very small territory it
00:01:22 only has
00:01:25 68 square kilometers but it is a
00:01:29 very very peculiar territory and in this
00:01:33 video I am going to give you 6 curious facts about
00:01:39 Gibraltar the number one curious fact is
00:01:43 that until this year until 20  21 gibraltar
00:01:48 has been considered a
00:01:50 tax haven because in gibraltar
00:01:55 taxes are very very low and many
00:02:00 companies are registered in gibraltar
00:02:05 in fact in gibraltar there are 30,000
00:02:08 registered companies and there are only
00:02:13 26,000 inhabitants that is, there are more
00:02:17 companies than inhabitants in gibraltar they
00:02:21 sell many products that  In Spain they
00:02:25 normally have very
00:02:28 high taxes and in Gibraltar they are sold with
00:02:32 very low taxes or without taxes,
00:02:35 so many Spaniards who live
00:02:39 near the border go to Gibraltar
00:02:42 to buy these cheaper products,
00:02:47 for example, Spanish people go to
00:02:51 Gibraltar to buy
00:02:54 and  cigarettes to buy cosmetics
00:02:59 even many people go to gibraltar
00:03:02 with their car to put gasoline to
00:03:06 fill the tank because it is cheaper to
00:03:10 do it in gibraltar than in spain due to
00:03:13 the low taxes the curious fact
00:03:16 number 2 is that in gibraltar the
00:03:20 official currency is the pound  Gibraltarian one
00:03:25 Gibraltarian pound is worth the same as one
00:03:29 pound ester  lina
00:03:32 and well in gibraltar you can pay
00:03:37 using gibraltarian pounds using
00:03:41 sterling pounds but also in many
00:03:43 businesses in many stores you can pay
00:03:47 with euros because many people who are going
00:03:50 to visit gibraltar go from europe
00:03:54 from spain and have euros to
00:03:58 pay curious fact number 3 about gibraltar
00:04:02 it is that it is the only place in europe where
00:04:07 there are monkeys in freedom
00:04:11 the monkeys of gibraltar are
00:04:14 everywhere and they are a little
00:04:18 naughty monkeys these monkeys are not afraid
00:04:23 of people and many times they approach and
00:04:26 try to steal the bags of the people
00:04:30 who  passing through the street are some monkeys that
00:04:34 are not afraid of people and well if
00:04:38 you are going to gibraltar
00:04:40 you must be very careful with your
00:04:42 belongings because if you are not careful
00:04:45 a monkey can come and take your
00:04:50 things curious fact number 4 about gibraltar
00:04:54 is that in  gibraltar there is a
00:04:58 very very strange airport one of the
00:05:02 most expensive airports in the
00:05:05 world gibraltar airport has a
00:05:08 runway that  e is built
00:05:12 on the sea and there is only sea around
00:05:17 the runway when you are on the plane you are
00:05:20 taking off you
00:05:22 only see the sea around
00:05:24 and this airstrip
00:05:28 has a road through it
00:05:32 many cars
00:05:34 cross that airstrip
00:05:37 every day when a plane  is going to land
00:05:42 or is going to take off they have to cut off the
00:05:45 traffic for cars to allow the
00:05:49 plane to carry out its operations the curious fact
00:05:53 number 5 is that as many
00:05:57 times they have to cut the road
00:06:00 for the planes to arrive
00:06:04 , super long queues of traffic are formed  it is a
00:06:08 bit difficult to get
00:06:11 into by car because there is always a
00:06:15 very slow traffic, so many people who
00:06:19 enter gibraltar from spain
00:06:21 prefer to do it on foot many
00:06:25 people live in spain and work in
00:06:28 gibraltar those people usually cross the
00:06:32 border on
00:06:33 foot they usually cross the border on
00:06:36 foot to  avoid traffic jam
00:06:40 fun fact number 6 is that in
00:06:44 gibraltar the official language is
00:06:48 clear english  gibraltar is a british territory
00:06:52 but the people who live in gibraltar
00:06:55 speak an unofficial language an
00:07:00 informal language known as llanito
00:07:04 llanito is very funny because it is a
00:07:07 mix of british english
00:07:11 spanish andalusian southern spanish and that is
00:07:15 what llanito sounds like
00:07:18 and  I remember that we had
00:07:20 an ipad and he told us
00:07:24 if you see
00:07:26 one I don't know why
00:07:39 and you have ever visited Gibraltar

030,"00:00:00 This is the first episode in the
00:00:03 history of Spain' I'm going to explain the
00:00:07 history of Spain'
00:00:09 I'm going to explain the prehistory and
00:00:14 where some Spanish words came
00:00:17 from that
00:00:21 we still use in Spanish now
00:00:24 [Music]
00:00:30 and how are you?  As you will know or
00:00:34 many of you will know, Spain is
00:00:39 in the Iberian
00:01:09 Peninsula.  There are several places in Spain
00:01:12 with caves with paintings and then
00:01:18 later
00:01:22 we, Homo sapiens, arrived on the peninsula.
00:01:26 Before there were Neanderthals and
00:01:31 Homo sapiens entered and displaced them
00:01:33 and threw them out and in the Iberian Peninsula
00:01:36 several peoples lived several peoples
00:01:40 lived in different places  the
00:01:42 peninsula had the celts the celts
00:01:46 who came from the center of central europe
00:01:50 from europe but they were also in
00:01:53 great britain in ireland and in part of
00:01:56 spain and then there were also the
00:02:00 iberians the iberians occupied the east and
00:02:05 south of the peninsula
00:02:07 and the iberians made statues like this
00:02:11 this statue is very famous it is well
00:02:15 known here in spain  but we don't know
00:02:19 very well the Iberians the Iberians where they
00:02:23 came from
00:02:24 if they came here or they had been here for a long
00:02:27 time but the Iberians
00:02:31 had their own language their language their
00:02:34 own language not
00:02:37 and it is a language a language that was
00:02:41 written they had a way of writing it  yes
00:02:43 yes what happens is that now we don't know
00:02:47 what it says we don't know how to read the book we
00:02:52 haven't forgotten but
00:02:57 some words have remained in Spanish we have some
00:03:00 words that come from Ibero like for
00:03:04 example puppy
00:03:07 or bed or shoe which surely is not
00:03:13 100%  sure but surely they come from the
00:03:18 Iberian language and there were also
00:03:22 other towns on the peninsula there were
00:03:24 other smaller towns
00:03:27 and at this time many came to
00:03:31 eat  trade to buy and sell things
00:03:36 the Phoenicians came the Phoenicians
00:03:40 were in many places around the
00:03:43 Mediterranean they were in many places and they
00:03:46 came to trade to buy and
00:03:49 sell things and the Greeks also came
00:03:53 and the Greeks had some
00:03:56 city some city in Spain also
00:04:00 some city in the  peninsula in the
00:04:04 iberian peninsula especially on the coast
00:04:07 on the coast of the mediterranean sea true
00:04:12 the phoenicians and the
00:04:17 greeks got along well they got along well with
00:04:20 the inhabitants of the peninsula they didn't
00:04:23 fight or didn't fight much but
00:04:28 then the invaders came
00:04:33 invaders
00:04:35 invaded
00:04:37 Much of the peninsula and they
00:04:41 changed the situation of the peninsula changed a lot. Do
00:04:44 you know who I'm talking about?
00:05:04 next episode is good bye

008,"00:00:00 hello everyone how are you my name is
00:00:03 agustina i am from argentina and today i am going to
00:00:07 talk about my 5 favorite cities or towns
00:00:13 in my country argentina
00:00:19 [Music]
00:00:22 let's start good number 5 in number 5
00:00:27 we have the city of salta the city
00:00:32 of salta is  In the province
00:00:35 called Salta and it is in the north of our
00:00:40 country, it was really difficult to choose
00:00:45 between Salta and Jujuy, which are neighboring provinces,
00:00:51 that is, they are
00:00:54 next to each other, but I decided to choose
00:00:59 Salta because the city is a
00:01:04 little bigger.  And for me,
00:01:09 Jujuy, the Argentine north is
00:01:14 very special and has a very beautiful culture. It
00:01:18 is where there is still a bit
00:01:24 of an indigenous presence, that is, of
00:01:27 native people from Argentina or
00:01:33 South America. It is a place where it is very,
00:01:37 very hot and the climate is  very dry a
00:01:42 bit deserted the city of salta is
00:01:46 beautiful and different i think what i
00:01:51 like most about the city of salta is the
00:01:55 main square with the church and all the
00:02:01 restaurants around
00:02:04 it is not a  big city but you can
00:02:09 have many interesting experiences
00:02:12 eat typical food from the north like
00:02:17 empanadas from Salta
00:02:19 and it is a different and beautiful place from
00:02:24 Salta you can do many many
00:02:27 excursions
00:02:28 many trips to the north
00:02:32 mainly
00:02:34 the province of Salta and Jujuy
00:02:38 where you can  see
00:02:41 very very beautiful valleys and mountains some of the
00:02:45 best known attractions
00:02:49 in the devil's throat the hill
00:02:53 of seven colors
00:02:55 small towns like purmamarca and much
00:03:00 much more that is why it is in the top number
00:03:04 5 in number 4 we have the city of
00:03:10 mendoza  which is the capital of the
00:03:13 province mendoza mendoza is on the
00:03:17 west side of argentina that is to say very
00:03:22 close to chile mendoza is a province
00:03:26 that has part of the andes' which are
00:03:31 the mountains that divide chile and
00:03:36 argentina- this city is very very beautiful
00:03:41 I really like all the squares they
00:03:45 have, I'm not sure if there are 4 or 5, but
00:03:50 Mendoza has different
00:03:54 names based on a country, that is,
00:03:59 named  It is like a country, for example,
00:04:03 Plaza Espanya and Plaza Italia are all
00:04:07 different and have a typical style of the
00:04:12 country as they are called, for example, Plaza
00:04:16 de Espanya will have a decoration with
00:04:22 a little Spanish architecture. Also,
00:04:26 from Mendoza you can go to see many
00:04:31 vineyards
00:04:32 a vineyard is a place where
00:04:37 grapes are grown to make wines in
00:04:42 mendoza there are many very very
00:04:45 important wineries that make
00:04:48 top quality wines that are super famous in
00:04:53 argentina and also in the world number
00:04:58 3 number 3 is not a city
00:05:02 compared to
00:05:04 salta and mendoza because it is smaller
00:05:09 but it is a town called san
00:05:14 martín de los andes san martín de los
00:05:18 andes is in the province of neuquén in
00:05:22 the south of argentina it is in patagonia
00:05:26 and that is why there are many lakes mountains
00:05:32 there are animals  Everywhere really,
00:05:38 Argentine Patagonia is beautiful. San
00:05:43 Martín de los Andes has its name
00:05:46 thanks to the person who liberated
00:05:50 Argentina.
00:05:54 he calls jose
00:05:56 san martin and the city is called san
00:05:59 martin de los andes because the andes
00:06:03 well the andes are the mountains that
00:06:07 divide chile and argentina- and san martin
00:06:11 de los andes is very close to the
00:06:15 border and also when san martin
00:06:19 liberated argentina he crossed  In other words, I went
00:06:25 through the Andes, so the name San
00:06:29 Martín de los Andes has to do with it, it
00:06:33 refers to all of that. It is a very
00:06:37 small town with many small and beautiful houses,
00:06:42 but the best part of the town is the
00:06:46 bay. The town faces a lake and
00:06:51 has  A whole coast with a waterfront
00:06:56 A path to walk and the views from
00:07:00 there are beautiful The whole town is
00:07:04 super quiet The way to get there,
00:07:07 which is Route 40, is really very
00:07:12 beautiful and that is why it is in my top 3
00:07:17 places that I like the most  in argentina
00:07:20 number 2 well number 2 is nothing more and
00:07:25 nothing less than buenos aires
00:07:29 obviously it is buenos aires it had to
00:07:32 be in my top 5 of favorite cities or towns
00:07:36 in argentina because it is a
00:07:39 beautiful city with millions  of things
00:07:44 to do I think you can live
00:07:47 your whole life in Buenos Aires and do a
00:07:51 different activity every day and you will
00:07:55 have activities for your whole life
00:07:59 Buenos Aires- the culture is beautiful the
00:08:02 people
00:08:04 there are many attractions and many
00:08:10 different neighborhoods and neighborhoods are  La Boca, where the
00:08:13 little path is, which is the place where
00:08:18 immigrants from Europe arrived. It is a
00:08:21 very colorful place with many restaurants. There are
00:08:25 people dancing tango, which is the
00:08:29 typical dance of Argentina. It is also beautiful,
00:08:33 Puerto Madero, which is the most
00:08:36 modern part of the city.  The Río de la Plata is very, very nice
00:08:40 to walk at night. It
00:08:42 's
00:08:45 also beautiful.
00:08:50 Microcentro is also the most
00:08:53 central part of Buenos Aires.
00:09:04 all
00:09:08 the companies where the stock market is located
00:09:11 there are also the
00:09:15 most important monuments such as the
00:09:18 obelisk and the most important buildings  It is
00:09:22 like the congress also the pink house
00:09:26 is a very very typical place then there are
00:09:31 many more neighborhoods in belgrano there is
00:09:35 the chinatown palermo there are
00:09:38 many many many parks there is the
00:09:42 rose garden a park where there are many types
00:09:46 of flowers mainly roses there is the
00:09:49 japanese garden
00:09:51 really good  aires is a place that you
00:09:55 never
00:09:56 stop seeing it
00:09:59 's a lost city in south america that
00:10:04 doesn't really fit maybe with the
00:10:08 typical style of south america but it has
00:10:12 the culture so it's a mix of
00:10:15 europe and south america and it's
00:10:18 really beautiful well now if
00:10:21 we get to number one  which place is my
00:10:27 favorite here in argentina
00:10:29 well my favorite city in argentina is
00:10:33 ushuaia ushuaia is in the province of
00:10:38 tierra del fuego which is
00:10:42 well south of all argentina ushuaia
00:10:47 is also the southernmost city in the world
00:10:52 that means it is the city  further
00:10:56 south in the world it is something incredible ushuaia
00:11:01 is beautiful it has the entire coast that is
00:11:06 a bay it has mountains it has lakes and  It
00:11:12 really is beautiful the city is super
00:11:17 small but it is a very very
00:11:22 typical southern town and the buildings the houses
00:11:27 are mainly sheet metal like
00:11:32 corrugated metal and of different colors it
00:11:36 really is super cute there is also a
00:11:39 jail a prison the ushuaia jail
00:11:44 has a  super interesting story it was
00:11:47 the maximum security prison
00:11:50 here in argentina
00:11:54 and that is a good topic to talk about
00:11:57 in another video because it is super
00:11:59 interesting
00:12:00 really ushuaia is beautiful you can
00:12:04 see penguins and you can take
00:12:08 boat rides through the beagle channel
00:12:11 You can go very far to the south and also
00:12:16 from Ushuaia there are many possibilities
00:12:19 to go to Antarctica
00:12:21 because obviously Ushuaia, being
00:12:25 the southernmost city in the world,
00:12:28 is the closest to the active Antarctica,
00:12:31 obviously the weather is not the best in
00:12:36 winter  It is very very cold but for
00:12:40 me it is beautiful
00:12:43 if you go in summer you can visit it
00:12:47 quietly and
00:12:50 enjoy a very different but

00:00:06 How can it be?
00:00:10 [Music]
00:00:13 Hello, as we explained to you in the
00:00:18 video about the history of Spain in
00:00:24 1492, the Catholic kings had
00:00:27 just reconquered the peninsula, they had
00:00:31 just conquered Granada and
00:00:34 they managed to unify and throw out
00:00:38 all the  Arabs from the Iberian Peninsula
00:00:40 and also in that same year due to the
00:00:45 influence of the Spanish inquisition and
00:00:49 for wanting to have a good relationship with the
00:00:52 Pope, the Catholic kings decided that
00:00:56 there could no longer be Jews in Spain and that
00:01:01 the Jews had to convert to
00:01:05 Christianity or they would be expelled
00:01:09 So these
00:01:12 Jews who lived in Spain had to leave Spain,
00:01:15 they were Sephardic Jews, Sephardic Jews, because
00:01:19 for the Jews, or in Hebrew, Sepharad
00:01:23 referred to the Iberian Peninsula, so
00:01:27 many of these Jews decided not to
00:01:31 convert to Christianity and leave
00:01:34 Spain.
00:01:37 jews went to north
00:01:42 africa others went to north africa others went to
00:01:45 france to the united kingdom  or to belgium and the
00:01:50 netherlands and many went to the
00:01:55 ottoman empire the ottoman empire which at that
00:01:57 time was turkey greece and other
00:02:01 balkan countries and
00:02:04 settled there and many of these
00:02:07 jewish communities kept their
00:02:10 culture and kept their language the
00:02:13 language they spoke when they were in
00:02:15 the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula and that
00:02:19 language is
00:02:21 currently known as Ladino or
00:02:24 Judeo-Spanish and Ladino or Judeo-Spanish
00:02:28 is a language very similar to
00:02:32 medieval Castilian Spanish which was spoken at
00:02:36 that time in some places, for
00:02:39 example in Thessaloniki in Greece, the
00:02:42 Jewish community  the community of jews
00:02:45 was so important that ladino
00:02:48 became a language of commerce
00:02:51 even among people who were not
00:02:54 jewish so nowadays
00:02:57 judeo-Spanish is usually written with the
00:03:00 latin alphabet with the same alphabet
00:03:02 that we use in spain- but in the past
00:03:06 the Hebrew alphabet used to be widely used and right
00:03:10 now there are more than 2 million
00:03:14 Judeo-Spanish speakers and  n the world the
00:03:17 country with the most speakers is israel but
00:03:21 it is also spoken in other countries such as
00:03:24 france
00:03:24 usa italy turkey
00:03:28 then still after more than
00:03:32 500 years since the expulsion many
00:03:36 descendants of sephardic jews
00:03:39 still maintain their language but
00:03:42 unfortunately for many for the
00:03:45 For the most part, the transmission of the language
00:03:49 stopped with the generation of their grandparents and
00:03:52 they have not continued transmitting it,
00:03:55 so the ladino is in danger of
00:03:58 disappearing, although now there are attempts
00:04:01 to revive the ladino and to prevent it from
00:04:04 being lost thanks to organizations such as
00:04:07 the  91 I leave you a link below in the
00:04:10 description if you are interested and I have
00:04:13 prepared a video an interview with the
00:04:16 creator of this organization that I will
00:04:18 publish in a few days or a few
00:04:21 weeks and another of these attempts to
00:04:25 revitalize the ladino
00:04:28 this book this is the little prince but
00:04:32 As you can see, it does not put the little prince, it puts the little
00:04:34 prince yes yes and this is a good
00:04:40 translation of the book from the little prince to the
00:04:43 lady  no and you see that it is written well with
00:04:47 the Latin alphabet but also with
00:04:50 the Hebrew alphabet yes and it basically
00:04:55 says the same thing it puts the little prince well
00:04:59 the little prince is backwards so I have read
00:05:03 this book in fact I have read it in the
00:05:05 Hebrew alphabet and yes it is different
00:05:09 how we speak spanish nowadays but
00:05:11 it is still understood
00:05:14 we still understand it enough it is not difficult for
00:05:16 us to understand it like for example
00:05:19 well I am going to teach you I apologize to
00:05:22 the creatures for having dedicated this
00:05:24 book to an elderly person I do not apologize
00:05:28 to the  children for having dedicated this
00:05:30 book to an older person it is very
00:05:33 similar to current Spanish so
00:05:36 tell me below in the comments if
00:05:39 you knew what ladino was or not if
00:05:43 you had never heard of ladino and

001,"00:00:00 It is true that Latinas get angry
00:00:03 at everything or it is true that we like to
00:00:07 argue a lot or that perhaps we like gossip a lot, it
00:00:13 may just be a cliché or it
00:00:16 may just be a lie, but
00:00:19 today I am going to tell you things that
00:00:23 you should know before dating a
00:00:26 latina woman we started
00:00:31 [Music]
00:00:35 point number 1 latinas find out
00:00:40 everything
00:00:41 that's right if we ask you where you've been it
00:00:46 's because we already know where you
00:00:51 've been we're just giving you the
00:00:55 opportunity to know if you're telling the truth or if you're telling
00:00:58 lies but believe me
00:01:03 we all find out and if we ask you
00:01:06 something, it is most likely that we already know
00:01:11 the answer so be very careful and be
00:01:15 very careful if a Latina asks you
00:01:18 where you were,
00:01:21 what you did or who you were with because
00:01:27 believe me
00:01:29 we already know what you were doing, it
00:01:32 is simply a  little test so
00:01:35 remember my advice point number 2 we
00:01:40 love gossip if you are going to date a
00:01:44 latina you have to know that you are going to
00:01:48 become her boyfriend in her  best
00:01:52 friend in her mom in her brother and
00:01:57 everything you can encompass we need a
00:02:01 person we can gossip with we
00:02:05 need a person we
00:02:08 can't gossip to and a
00:02:13 person we can gossip to so it
00:02:17 's very  It is important to know that
00:02:20 we Latinas love gossip,
00:02:23 this soap opera gossip, that gossip
00:02:27 that is rumored in the streets, that
00:02:30 we want to know, the fresh
00:02:33 gossip, the gossip of the day, and believe me, we hope
00:02:36 that you are the one we can tell it with
00:02:39 and we hope that  be you who can
00:02:42 bring us the fresh gossip point number three
00:02:45 with a very important point
00:02:48 dating a Latina not just
00:02:52 dating her you
00:02:54 automatically sign a contract where
00:02:57 you practically have to date your entire
00:03:00 family so point number three the
00:03:04 family is very important to
00:03:07 Latinas so much so that in many cultures,
00:03:12 if not the majority, you have to
00:03:16 ask your father's permission.
00:03:18 Have you heard about that? Well,
00:03:22 if you have.  listened believe me it's not a
00:03:25 myth it's a reality before you
00:03:29 can date a latina before
00:03:33 you can ask her the famous question of
00:03:36 wants to be my girlfriend you don't have to
00:03:40 ask your father-in-law hey good father-in-law
00:03:45 hang out with your daughter believe me no  It's
00:03:48 that easy,
00:03:50 you have to have a speech prepared
00:03:52 so that the father-in-law can know if it
00:03:56 suits the daughter or not,
00:03:59 so believe me, it's very important to know
00:04:03 that you're not only going to go out with the Latina,
00:04:05 but with her whole family,
00:04:08 that's how it is, and she's preparing  your speech
00:04:11 because it is the first thing you are going to have to
00:04:13 do to be able to go out with her
00:04:15 next point that is closely related to
00:04:19 the previous one the parents are strict and
00:04:23 we don't have liberal parents here we
00:04:27 don't have parents who are going to tell you it's
00:04:29 okay daughter go with  your boyfriend on
00:04:32 vacation two weeks very well
00:04:36 here there is no that here the rules are
00:04:39 clear
00:04:41 here you can't stay on vacation with your boyfriend
00:04:44 here you can't stay the night
00:04:47 with your boyfriend you can't
00:04:50 until the 1st and  Until marriage, that's how it is,
00:04:56 so forget about wanting to
00:05:00 have very liberal lives with a Latina
00:05:04 because normally our parents are
00:05:06 very strict, so first the ring
00:05:09 and then the rest. Another very
00:05:12 important thing you should know is that
00:05:14 Latinas clean
00:05:16 24,
00:05:19 that's right.  we love cleanliness we
00:05:23 love that you enter the house and it smells like
00:05:26 pine trees have you heard that it is the pinol
00:05:31 pine is a super famous flavoring in
00:05:34 Latin America it
00:05:35 basically smells like pine the pine of the
00:05:39 forests but believe me it is true you enter
00:05:43 a Mexican house and automatically  going to
00:05:47 know the aunt to the grandmother to the mother
00:05:51 with some bottle of pinol and believe me we
00:05:54 love cleaning all the time
00:05:58 we are wiping some
00:06:00 surface because we want everything to
00:06:03 smell delicious and last point but not
00:06:07 least something that they have to
00:06:11 take into account you will never win an
00:06:16 argument with a Latina
00:06:19 in general women have very
00:06:22 good arguments when it comes to winning a
00:06:25 fight  a but believe me that with
00:06:29 Latinas you will not be able to we have
00:06:32 arguments we have evidence we have
00:06:36 written or screenshots
00:06:39 we have witnesses and we have everything we
00:06:42 need to win an argument
00:06:46 so
00:06:47 believe me you will not be able to win an
00:06:50 argument against a Latina we are
00:06:53 prepared to give  our point and
00:06:56 we are prepared for the fight and
00:06:58 we are prepared to win the
00:07:01 argument so you already know things that
00:07:05 you have to consider before dating
00:07:08 anything so tell me what would be the
00:07:12 things that are normally used before
00:07:16 starting a relationship in your country tell me
00:07:19 in  the comments and I hope to see you

233,"00:00:00 because because Spanish is so difficult
00:00:05 because I have to remember it if a
00:00:11 word is masculine or feminine
00:00:14 all the tenses the
00:00:17 conjugations the irregular verbs
00:00:20 when to use each tense because it
00:00:25 couldn't be easier
00:00:30 [Music]
00:00:33 hello well in dreaming spanic I always see you
00:00:38 we recommend not studying grammar but
00:00:42 we mean not studying the rules
00:00:46 not studying the grammar rules not
00:00:50 studying when to use the
00:00:53 third person singular of the past
00:00:56 tense of the
00:00:59 subjunctive if we do not mean having
00:01:04 acquired the grammar acquire the
00:01:07 grammar and use the grammar when
00:01:10 we understand  something or when we talk, yes it
00:01:14 is important and today I am going to explain
00:01:17 why I am going to tell you why it is
00:01:20 important to have acquired the grammar to
00:01:23 have absorbed it then because it is
00:01:27 important to have acquired the grammar it
00:01:30 is important to communicate to
00:01:33 understand oneself with other people for that reason  it
00:01:37 is not enough to have studied
00:01:40 vocabulary with h  Having learned a
00:01:43 list of words and then going and saying the
00:01:46 words and that's it, it's not important to
00:01:50 receive a lot of input to really
00:01:53 pick up the grammar and get used to
00:01:57 the way those words are used,
00:02:00 how they are placed, how the words change,
00:02:03 because when you say a
00:02:07 sentence  It is the words, it is the
00:02:10 subjunctives, the verbs that have the
00:02:14 most meaning, what gives
00:02:18 the sentence the most meaning and at the beginning
00:02:20 when you are beginning to learn
00:02:23 Spanish, the words are the most
00:02:26 important, it is what will help
00:02:30 you understand the most.  the input and it is what
00:02:35 you are going to learn the most at the beginning you are
00:02:38 going to be
00:02:40 learning a lot of vocabulary but at
00:02:44 higher levels and especially in
00:02:47 conversations it is more and more
00:02:50 important because sometimes they
00:02:54 can misunderstand us they can
00:02:56 understand us well sometimes it can happen but
00:03:00 on  all because whenever you are
00:03:03 having a conversation the other
00:03:06 person is
00:03:07 going to have to make more effort, they are going to
00:03:09 have to think more.  s will get more tired
00:03:13 if he has to try to understand what you
00:03:17 are saying what you mean
00:03:20 when the grammar is telling him
00:03:23 something else the grammar makes him think
00:03:26 that what you mean is something else and
00:03:29 the same for you if you haven't acquired
00:03:32 the grammar  also when you hear
00:03:35 something you are going to have to be thinking
00:03:38 wait wait here what does it mean
00:03:40 does it mean yes or no but why
00:03:46 different Spanish grammar
00:03:48 because it is so difficult because it is
00:03:52 different from English grammar or
00:03:55 from the grammar of your language  and
00:03:57 well the easiest way to explain it
00:04:01 is that Spanish is not English with other
00:04:05 words it is not English that we
00:04:09 think we are special and we have
00:04:12 changed the words and we use
00:04:15 different words not Spanish because it appeared
00:04:19 as a natural language just like
00:04:21 English appeared  No, Spanish is its
00:04:25 own system and you can't expect to
00:04:28 change words, use
00:04:31 English grammar or use only part of
00:04:35 the grammar.  Attic of Spanish learn
00:04:38 only the easiest and try to use
00:04:41 it easier to use the present to use not to use
00:04:46 the articles
00:04:48 and try to use that for everything for all
00:04:51 your communication it does not work
00:04:54 because many people many people who
00:04:58 learn Spanish think that good if they
00:05:02 use the present the  The present is general
00:05:05 it can be used for many things I am going to
00:05:08 use only the present for many
00:05:11 things and for the past I am going to learn
00:05:15 only one past tense and as it is
00:05:19 general I will use it for everything I am not going to be
00:05:22 very specific but they will understand me
00:05:25 because I am speaking in a general way
00:05:28 no it is not true you are not speaking in
00:05:32 a general way you maybe think that the
00:05:35 present is general but it is not very
00:05:39 specific when you use the present you are
00:05:42 saying if I do this this is
00:05:47 happening this is so you can't use it
00:05:50 for  talk about if this will
00:05:54 happen what would happen if this happened when this
00:05:57 happens no you can't because when people
00:06:01 hear you say I'm going people will think it's
00:06:05 worth it  you are walking you are not
00:06:08 talking about a general idea of ​​walking
00:06:11 you are saying yes yes I walk and the same
00:06:14 with the past when you use a
00:06:17 past you learn only one and you
00:06:19 use it for everything you are really being
00:06:22 specific you are saying yes I
00:06:26 sang I sang  sometimes you sang you
00:06:31 are not talking about once
00:06:34 one day you sang for example and the
00:06:37 people who hear you will misunderstand you or
00:06:41 perhaps they will understand you because within the
00:06:44 context it does not make sense no they do not
00:06:47 understand what you have said and they will
00:06:49 think and  say okay surely this
00:06:53 person wanted to say that he sang what he
00:06:55 sang no
00:06:57 but again the other person well he has
00:07:00 to think he has to get tired so
00:07:03 another question that I have seen that many
00:07:07 people ask on the internet is
00:07:10 why well if it is so difficult
00:07:14 why why are they talking  like this because they don't
00:07:16 simplify it because they don't speak in an
00:07:19 easier way we couldn't change we
00:07:22 couldn't change how we speak we
00:07:24 couldn't change Spanish and well the
00:07:28 answer m  The simplest for this and the
00:07:31 most accurate the most correct I think is
00:07:34 that we don't want we don't want we don't want to
00:07:38 change the way we talk and you
00:07:41 who are you who are you to tell us
00:07:43 that we have to change the way
00:07:46 we talk who are you to tell us that
00:07:49 we have  to change our language for
00:07:52 you because the truth is that native speakers
00:07:55 have no problem for
00:07:58 us the language works well
00:08:01 we can be
00:08:03 when we want we can communicate a
00:08:07 meaning in a very clear way that
00:08:10 the other person understands us well it is useful it is
00:08:13 very useful to be  specific to be able to
00:08:15 communicate ideas clearly and that we
00:08:18 understand each other well then it is
00:08:21 true that languages ​​change
00:08:24 languages ​​can change over time
00:08:26 but these changes
00:08:29 are usually slow and small
00:08:32 small changes occur that
00:08:35 over time can change a language
00:08:37 quite a bit but  each step is very small
00:08:41 , changes are usually made when the
00:08:45 speakers of the language give us  Let's keep in mind
00:08:47 that if there is a gap here or there is an idea
00:08:51 that cannot be communicated I am going to use
00:08:54 another word I am going to say it in another
00:08:56 way I am going to use a word from another
00:08:59 language to communicate this idea but
00:09:02 these changes are produced by
00:09:05 the speakers  of the language in general
00:09:08 when there is an external interest in changing
00:09:11 the language when there is influence from
00:09:14 people who are not part of the
00:09:17 community who do not speak the
00:09:19 language who try to change your language
00:09:21 because normally and naturally
00:09:25 rejection is generated we feel that someone
00:09:28 is trying to invade  something that is
00:09:31 ours and the truth is that we perceive
00:09:34 it we perceive it as a very imperialist way of thinking
00:09:38 not that they are trying to
00:09:40 force us that they are trying to
00:09:43 oppress us to change something that they
00:09:47 think we do not want to change no so I
00:09:50 think it is best not  do
00:09:53 it
00:09:55 i'm talking i know most of
00:09:58 you don't think this way ok
00:10:00 but i'm answering a question i
00:10:03 see often  do online but yes if you
00:10:06 think this way I think the best thing is to
00:10:09 change your way of thinking
00:10:12 understand that Spanish is not going to change
00:10:15 for you I think it is the easiest
00:10:17 because being realistic you are not going to
00:10:21 change the way millions of
00:10:24 native speakers speak  Spanish
00:10:26 then as an exercise for you
00:10:30 as homework I am going to ask you to think
00:10:33 of something difficult in your language to
00:10:37 think of something difficult in your
00:10:40 native language or English something that is
00:10:44 difficult and to think and imagine what
00:10:47 would happen if tomorrow simplifies it 6
00:10:51 you only you tomorrow
00:10:54 you ignore 6 that part of the grammar
00:10:58 you stop 6 using it
00:11:00 and starting to 6 always use the
00:11:02 same verb without changing it what would happen if you speak
00:11:06 6 in that way in that different way
00:11:09 in that strange way with your
00:11:11 family with your friends what  It would happen
00:11:14 what do you think the network would be the
00:11:18 reaction of your acquaintances if he speaks
00:11:21 6 in that way that it is not usual that
00:11:24 you think of writing to me in the comments
00:11:27 What do you think the
00:11:30 reaction of the people
00:11:33 around you would be if you speak 6 your language in
00:11:36 a simplified way in a different way,
00:11:39 okay, goodbye
00:11:44 and if you want to know the best way to
00:11:48 improve your Spanish, take a look at the page
00:11:53 of our method where we  we explain

006,"00:00:00 in this video i'm going to talk about some
00:00:04 things that
00:00:06 surprised me when i moved to the uk
00:00:14 [Music]
00:00:17 hi well
00:00:20 when i first moved to the
00:00:25 uk when i went to live in
00:00:28 england
00:00:30 there were a lot of things about
00:00:35 british culture that surprised me surprised me
00:00:38 A lot
00:00:41 in this video I want to tell you what
00:00:45 those things were. The first thing
00:00:50 that surprised me that caught my attention
00:00:55 has to do with food. Food
00:01:00 when I was little in Spain.
00:01:05 British food had a very bad reputation
00:01:10 , which means that the Spanish
00:01:15 They thought that British food was not
00:01:20 good, it was not good at all, that was the
00:01:25 prejudice, the idea of ​​the Spanish, but
00:01:31 when I moved to the United Kingdom- when I
00:01:35 moved to England, I tried British food
00:01:43 and I thought it was very good. I did not understand
00:01:48 why it had a bad reputation.
00:01:51 British food is
00:01:55 different from Spanish food, but it is
00:01:59 just as good. One thing that
00:02:03 caught my attention
00:02:05 is that in British cuisine, in the
00:02:11 food that  It is eaten in the United Kingdom there is a
00:02:18 lot of influence from Asia of Asian food
00:02:25 in England in the United Kingdom- in
00:02:28 general there are many
00:02:31 restaurants serving Indian food Thai food
00:02:36 and Indian food is very good, for
00:02:41 example in the United Kingdom- it is usually  very
00:02:45 good so this surprised me in
00:02:50 a positive way another thing that
00:02:53 surprised me was the
00:02:56 breakfasts the breakfast because in spain
00:03:01 the typical breakfast is not very varied in
00:03:06 spain- the typical breakfast is a coffee
00:03:12 and maybe some toast yes some toast
00:03:18 or sometimes some cereals
00:03:21 but  in england the breakfast is much
00:03:27 more varied sometimes it has bacon it has
00:03:33 beans it has eggs eggs it is very very
00:03:41 varied and I also liked that very much I
00:03:45 liked the variety the variety of food
00:03:50 at breakfast also in the United Kingdom
00:03:55 the times of meals the hours
00:03:59 to eat they are very flexible there are
00:04:03 people who eat lunch very early they
00:04:08 eat at 12 for example at
00:04:11 noon there are people who eat
00:04:15 dinner late  Also, sometimes it's very
00:04:20 early and sometimes it's later in
00:04:24 Spain' I think that
00:04:29 meal times are much more rigid and
00:04:34 everyone eats more or less at the same time,
00:04:39 apart from meals, another thing that
00:04:44 caught my attention was  the houses the
00:04:49 British houses
00:04:50 because when I arrived in London
00:04:55 I saw the houses from the outside from the
00:04:59 street you can see very old very
00:05:04 old
00:05:06 houses they are rows of terraced houses they
00:05:11 are very old they are houses that are
00:05:15 over a century old
00:05:19 and when  you see the houses from the outside you
00:05:26 can't imagine that inside many of
00:05:31 these houses are very modern
00:05:36 people buy these old houses
00:05:40 but they reform them and put them very
00:05:46 very new very modern and it caught my
00:05:51 attention to
00:05:52 enter these British houses and see
00:05:56 that for  inside everything was very nice everything
00:06:00 was very new the decoration in the
00:06:05 uk- the decoration of the houses
00:06:08 is also a little different they are
00:06:12 warmer houses they are houses more
00:06:16 hours inside you have  They have carpet on the
00:06:20 floor, which in Spain we don't have, in Spain
00:06:24 the floors are tiled but in the
00:06:30 UK in many houses I would say that
00:06:33 in most houses there is carpet. Also,
00:06:38 another difference that I noticed was
00:06:44 that in British houses there is no carpet.
00:06:48 blinds on the windows and in spain
00:06:53 all houses I would say the vast majority
00:06:58 of houses have blinds and we can
00:07:02 make the room totally
00:07:06 dark but in the uk this is
00:07:10 not the case people do not have blinds in their
00:07:15 houses and it is a little more 10
00:07:19 darken the room a lot of light
00:07:23 enters the room another thing that is very
00:07:27 different in the united kingdom are the
00:07:32 rules of courtesy for example in the
00:07:37 united kingdom it is customary to
00:07:42 apologize apologize for things that in spain we do not
00:07:47 consider that
00:07:50 deserve an apology
00:07:53 in the kingdom  united- they apologize for
00:07:57 example when they approach you in a
00:08:01 public space if a person
00:08:04 approaches you for example in a supermarket you
00:08:09 are in the supermarket
00:08:11 looking at the products  cts and a person passes
00:08:15 by they apologize to you and
00:08:19 apologize for approaching you for
00:08:23 bothering you for invading your personal space they
00:08:30 are in that sense they are very different from
00:08:36 the Spaniards who in this type of
00:08:41 situation do not apologize I was also
00:08:46 very surprised by the service when you go
00:08:51 to  a supermarket or you go to the bank or
00:08:57 any type of office where they provide you with
00:09:01 a service,
00:09:03 the workers
00:09:05 are usually very friendly, for example, if you
00:09:11 go to the supermarket
00:09:13 and you have to wait a bit because there is
00:09:17 a queue of people to pay for the
00:09:21 purchase, you have to wait to pay
00:09:24 The cashier who is
00:09:28 attending that
00:09:31 person thanks them for waiting. They
00:09:35 consider that the customer has
00:09:39 waited and deserves
00:09:43 a thank you for waiting for
00:09:47 waiting to receive that service. This
00:09:51 is something that is not done in
00:09:56 Spain. In Spain, you can be waiting.  a lot of
00:10:00 time for your shift
00:10:05 and when you arrive the person who
00:10:08 attends you the worker who attends you does
00:10:11 not apologize  He apologizes
00:10:15 for the wait, nor does he thank you for
00:10:19 being patient,
00:10:21 so that caught my attention and
00:10:26 it was something very good for me. A very
00:10:30 positive aspect of this culture seemed to me that they
00:10:34 were very educated people, very
00:10:37 considerate, something else
00:10:42 What was surprising in England was the way of
00:10:46 drinking the way of drinking alcohol, for
00:10:50 example, in British pubs
00:10:53 around six or seven in the evening,
00:10:57 many people leave work and go
00:11:01 to drink in the pub and you can see them
00:11:05 all standing sometimes in the  street
00:11:10 everyone is drinking some
00:11:14 very large pints of beer some very large glasses of
00:11:18 beer that in spain
00:11:23 we really do not have in spain the
00:11:27 amounts of alcohol that they serve you are
00:11:32 smaller they are not such
00:11:36 large glasses of beer and I think that people
00:11:40 in england  drink faster I don't know if they
00:11:46 drink more or less than in Spain because
00:11:50 in Spain people also drink beer they
00:11:54 drink wine they go to bars but I
00:11:59 think that in Spain the rhythm is
00:12:04 faster  relaxed people are seated they
00:12:08 drink a small beer they eat a little
00:12:12 and i have the impression that
00:12:16 england people drink faster
00:12:20 and yes it is a slightly different rhythm
00:12:25 personally in that aspect i like
00:12:29 spain more i like
00:12:32 the rhythm in bars in spain more  It is a
00:12:37 little more relaxed and if I like
00:12:42 Spanish bars more, the way of
00:12:46 educating children is also a little
00:12:50 different in the United Kingdom. In the
00:12:54 United Kingdom, children are educated with a little
00:12:58 more tact.
00:13:01 This means that  parents, for
00:13:06 example, when they are with their children in
00:13:11 front of other people in the park
00:13:15 on the street
00:13:17 in any public
00:13:20 space parents are much more discreet
00:13:25 when they talk to their children or when they
00:13:30 scold them if in Spain the parents are
00:13:35 very loud if they speak very loudly  stay
00:13:39 still don't touch that Spanish parents
00:13:41 yes but British parents
00:13:46 speak softly they say don't do that stay
00:13:50 still they don't want to attract attention and
00:13:56 I find that very amusing because of  It's not like that
00:14:00 in Spain. In Spain, parents
00:14:03 yell a lot in public and everyone
00:14:07 can see, they can see everything that
00:14:11 's happening. They're seeing the
00:14:15 problem that the father and the child are
00:14:18 having.
00:14:24 Attention was the way of speaking the
00:14:29 affectionate names
00:14:32 typical of the United Kingdom because the
00:14:38 British have a reputation for being
00:14:42 a bit cold people and I thought before
00:14:47 I moved I thought that the British
00:14:49 were colder people less close and
00:14:56 when I went there I realized  that this
00:15:01 is not true it is customary in the
00:15:06 united kingdom- to call people with an
00:15:09 affectionate name because in spain
00:15:12 we say sweetie or sweetheart or pretty and in the
00:15:18 united kingdom it is also very normal to do
00:15:21 this by calling
00:15:25 unknown people with whom they
00:15:28 interact in the  street in a shop it is
00:15:33 very normal for a british or a
00:15:37 british person to call you call you
00:15:39 pretty or call you honey it is something very
00:15:43 normal and I found this very funny it
00:15:47 seemed funny and I liked it  It just seems
00:15:51 to me that people sound much
00:15:56 nicer when they do this and these are
00:16:00 some of the things that
00:16:04 struck me that surprised me when I
00:16:08 lived in the UK - tell me if your
00:16:13 country is similar to the UK or if it is
00:16:18 more similar  see you

174,"00:00:00 hello hello pablo how are you going to
00:00:04 talk to us today well today we are going to talk about
00:00:07 my experiences with Spanish and
00:00:10 why I have liked Spanish so much in my
00:00:12 life
00:00:13 perfect
00:00:15 ah
00:00:17 [Music] well
00:00:20 oli
00:00:22 if you don't know it since I guess  yes,
00:00:25 you will know him, he has a youtube channel, he
00:00:28 is also a polyglot and in this
00:00:31 video we are making two videos, one
00:00:34 for my channel and the other for his, and if
00:00:37 you want to see the video on his channel, I will
00:00:39 leave it below in a link in the
00:00:41 video description  Okay, we
00:00:44 speak in English, no, and exactly, on the
00:00:47 oli channel, we'll be having a
00:00:50 conversation in English, well,
00:00:52 thanks for being here for coming to the
00:00:56 channel. Good for you, for the invitation, it's
00:00:59 a
00:01:03 pleasure.  I would like
00:01:06 you to tell us if what you have said is
00:01:08 because you like it and maybe at first
00:01:11 you introduce a bit because you started to
00:01:15 learn Spanish because it caught your
00:01:17 attention
00:01:19 well my first contact with Spanish
00:01:23 was
00:01:26 in fact the in  I don't
00:01:29 exactly remember the point but it was in A or in
00:01:32 London or in Paris and I was about 19 years old
00:01:38 and I
00:01:41 was living in London
00:01:44 and for the first time in my life I had
00:01:47 contact with foreigners because in
00:01:49 London there are so many people from all over the
00:01:53 world then  For a landmark Englishman like
00:01:57 me who grew up in the countryside, the world had been given to us to
00:02:03 arrive in London and suddenly meet
00:02:06 people from France and Italy from I don't know
00:02:08 where it was an incredible experience that
00:02:12 you didn't grow up in London you grew more in
00:02:14 the countryside
00:02:15 in  the countryside in a small town of 200
00:02:17 people
00:02:19 [Music]
00:02:21 where everyone seems like me
00:02:25 and then
00:02:28 at that time in london in
00:02:32 a month or a few weeks I met people
00:02:35 from italy from spain from france and I said to myself
00:02:38 well it wouldn't be bad  learn a little of
00:02:41 these languages ​​to be able to converse in a
00:02:43 language other than English and I'm
00:02:47 there
00:02:47 little by little
00:02:50 I was
00:02:53 more interested in various
00:02:56 languages ​​than Spain was one of the languages
00:02:59 that caught my attention the most  n okay
00:03:03 then in london they began to be
00:03:05 interested in languages ​​in general
00:03:10 because you are english so people i
00:03:13 have met before are
00:03:15 english who speak spanish well many
00:03:18 times they have lived in spain and speak with
00:03:20 a spanish accent but i don't notice you a
00:03:24 Spanish accent or a standard Spanish accent
00:03:28 if not I have never lived in
00:03:34 Spain at most it was a season that I spent in
00:03:37 Argentina I was living three months 34
00:03:41 months in Buenos Aires but in
00:03:45 fact the most important thing that
00:03:47 happened to me in Spanish was that  In
00:03:51 a great friend who says in London they were
00:03:55 from the Canary Islands and it's okay
00:03:58 I met him at the university where
00:04:01 we were both studying
00:04:03 music so we had that common interest in
00:04:06 music but he wasn't
00:04:09 interested in any of the English he spoke very
00:04:11 bad English  he wasn't interested in improving
00:04:13 his level either and nothing like that he was in
00:04:15 london but he didn't want to improve his english
00:04:17 there are many musicians like that they know if they are going
00:04:21 for music not for him and not for him
00:04:24 good language so they go to the homeland of the
00:04:29 beatles if maybe they have heard some
00:04:33 of that but not his
00:04:36 main interest in music so he was
00:04:40 an incredible opportunity for me because
00:04:45 because I could converse with this person
00:04:49 in Spanish without him always trying to
00:04:52 respond  in english and practice her
00:04:55 english with me and then for two
00:04:58 years she was living an almost
00:05:01 spanish life in london and i have not been able to
00:05:05 learn without having to go and
00:05:07 live in this same place of course so
00:05:11 you learned more spanish in london than in
00:05:14 spain or than in  argentina was not spoken
00:05:18 well enough before i went to argentina
00:05:21 and before before oct
00:05:24 i have visited spain and many times but
00:05:26 that was all yes always after having
00:05:30 a certain level of communication
00:05:34 if it is ideal it is a very rare situation
00:05:38 normally if you live in a
00:05:41 English speaking country all foreigners
00:05:42 want to speak English I don't know if I was
00:05:46 very lucky very lucky and one of
00:05:48 the things I often ask myself
00:05:52 Before, what would I do now if
00:05:55 I wanted to reproduce this experience, of
00:05:58 course, it is very difficult, yes, above all,
00:06:02 perhaps with a less common, less
00:06:05 popular language, it would be difficult to find a
00:06:07 person who is willing to
00:06:10 always speak the language with you
00:06:12 and also have the time to be able to
00:06:15 do that, because now  with a job
00:06:17 with family with everything I can't be
00:06:20 every day with a with a colleague
00:06:25 drinking beer our life is not at
00:06:29 all
00:06:30 that is an opportunity that
00:06:34 people have who have it many times
00:06:36 because they are students and have a lot of
00:06:39 free time and  It is also a
00:06:42 very, very convenient situation,
00:06:45 but if it was basically due to the
00:06:49 investment that I have been able to learn from, the
00:06:52 interesting thing is that this investment
00:06:54 was not in Spain but here in England, of
00:06:58 course,
00:06:59 the option for many people to be in
00:07:02 that situation is  having to go live in the
00:07:04 country
00:07:07 then tell me, thanks to knowing how to speak
00:07:11 Spanish, what situations have you experienced that
00:07:14 without speaking Spanish would have been
00:07:17 im  possible
00:07:19 and I lost count but above all
00:07:25 especially for me I think
00:07:29 the best thing would have to be to be able to
00:07:31 travel meet people and
00:07:35 have a kind of profound reaction
00:07:38 thanks to the language
00:07:40 for example when I went to Buenos
00:07:42 Aires- for the first time
00:07:45 in the  Second day I met a girl
00:07:49 who was working in a
00:07:52 travel agency that many years ago in
00:07:56 2004 around there
00:08:00 she was used to the fact that all
00:08:04 foreigners traveling through Argentina
00:08:07 could not speak a word in Spanish
00:08:09 so when I went there  to
00:08:12 buy a ticket for I don't know what
00:08:15 we started to talk in Spanish it
00:08:19 caught her attention and she wanted to meet
00:08:21 me in
00:08:25 the end
00:08:29 we ended up going out together and I met her
00:08:33 family
00:08:35 and many friends and for the short time I
00:08:39 was in Argentina for nothing that in
00:08:41 just  three months because that relationship
00:08:43 was not also in the end but
00:08:46 for example that you months had
00:08:47 an access to the country and to the culture
00:08:51 what would it be
00:08:53 totally  impossible yes yes yes if I were a
00:08:56 tourist so that's what Spanish
00:08:59 has given me is a series of
00:09:02 very deep experiences I understand it I also
00:09:06 feel that if you go to a country and only
00:09:09 speak English you have contact with
00:09:12 people who have learned English  Well,
00:09:16 they are only with those people, with
00:09:19 people who perhaps have more influence
00:09:21 from abroad or not, but you don't get to
00:09:25 learn, you can't get to know the
00:09:28 culture and the local people well without a type of
00:09:31 filter that passes everything through this,
00:09:35 not talking and  reading is I suppose
00:09:37 that has happened to you here it has also happened to me a
00:09:39 lot in japan people because things
00:09:44 about japan well you can read a
00:09:46 lot about japan in spanish or english
00:09:48 but it is always going through the filter
00:09:51 of a foreigner who has lived through it no no
00:09:54 you are living it yourself if you are not
00:09:56 communicating directly with the
00:09:59 people there
00:10:01 and if I think there is a very big difference
00:10:04 even in the people who are living in
00:10:06 the country a difference between  the people
00:10:08 who only speak English with the
00:10:10 locals who know how to speak English and the
00:10:12 people who speak the local language and who
00:10:15 have access to the whole world and to the
00:10:16 whole of society and that's the problem if
00:10:19 you don't open up the language when you arrive
00:10:21 you could you could you could  make
00:10:25 friends but they will only be people
00:10:27 who are interested in English
00:10:29 abroad and that has to put you
00:10:32 in a situation
00:10:35 from which it is quite difficult to escape
00:10:38 because because it is easier we can
00:10:41 practically continue doing what
00:10:43 you are doing  In an English bubble that
00:10:48 you believe and yes, that's why I don't understand.
00:10:51 I was in China for a few months
00:10:55 and I was in a city north of
00:10:56 Dalian and my experience was that nobody
00:11:00 spoke English. I went down the street and went to
00:11:02 restaurants and no one spoke English.
00:11:04 but I found myself there foreigners who
00:11:08 said here it is not necessary to speak Chinese
00:11:10 I can do everything in English and he said
00:11:14 but as if nobody speaks English sir
00:11:16 because it is from there then but I
00:11:19 c  They still manage to make a
00:11:21 bubble around themselves, being able to do everything in
00:11:23 English,
00:11:25 these people because they are interested in being there,
00:11:27 so if it is not only for others,
00:11:31 for other reasons, they are not like us,
00:11:33 they are not geeks of learning languages, this
00:11:37 is a Spanish word, geeks, it is called
00:11:39 fricke, well.  someone who likes
00:11:42 something a lot is not a geek of something
00:11:45 has some experience so you
00:11:48 would really like that it caught your
00:11:50 attention when you have visited, for example,
00:11:52 in Spain
00:11:54 an experience
00:11:58 I think what I like most about Spain
00:12:00 is the Spanish culture of  It's full
00:12:04 of life
00:12:06 [Music] It
00:12:08 's true that I know more about the
00:12:10 Canary Islands side than I do about the peninsula.
00:12:13 I don't know if there's another difference, but the one
00:12:17 that most times in the Canary Islands is associated with
00:12:19 sunstroke, yes, many, many more and for
00:12:21 longer, I've also been  spent in the
00:12:24 canaries so i don't know much the
00:12:26 difference
00:12:29 the weather obviously makes a big
00:12:31 difference because because it's very
00:12:34 hot so it doesn't matter what and at what
00:12:40 time  of the year you go, you can continue, you are
00:12:42 having a beer outside and so
00:12:47 the life there is a life in which
00:12:50 people really live outside the house
00:12:54 in nature and nature are usually
00:12:58 given in Portuguese and
00:13:01 and
00:13:02 [Music]
00:13:05 is quite simple but from a lot of
00:13:08 quality, good weather, good
00:13:12 beer, good food, then the
00:13:16 experiences that I have liked the most have
00:13:19 been that of being in a situation
00:13:22 of great quality in all senses
00:13:26 that perhaps for someone from there it is
00:13:29 difficult to understand, but you who have lived
00:13:33 in  London is very different here, it's
00:13:36 very cold, we're always inside the
00:13:37 house, eating things that don't make us so
00:13:40 good, and then I'm frustrated by
00:13:42 some quality issue.
00:13:44 I've been to London a few times,
00:13:46 normally a few weeks here, a few
00:13:48 weeks there,
00:13:50 but that surprised me.  the food
00:13:53 when I was little I made a home
00:13:55 state and he was surprised by the food
00:14:01 and then if I was when it was 2010
00:14:04 [Music]
00:14:06 617 2017 in summer it was very hot
00:14:11 I think that  It was a year that it was very hot
00:14:14 in the summer and I was in a cafe
00:14:17 in the station, I think, and it was very hot
00:14:19 because they don't have air conditioning,
00:14:20 normally they don't need it,
00:14:25 and when it's hot in
00:14:27 London, that's the best time to
00:14:30 being in london because it's hot there is
00:14:33 that sun and people go crazy
00:14:35 because the world in which they were all
00:14:37 sunbathing exactly so
00:14:40 burning
00:14:42 so there are 23 weeks a year that a
00:14:48 year that makes a lot of party weather a
00:14:56 lot everything but detail  as it is part
00:14:58 of everyday life, that is,
00:15:03 it has become part of the culture
00:15:05 of the people of the people be
00:15:07 marley from day to day in spain
00:15:09 we sunbathe from our balcony at home
00:15:11 we have the sun and that is for you
00:15:17 That makes you a very different person.
00:15:20 Every country has its
00:15:22 point, its culture,
00:15:24 its special things,
00:15:27 but that is what I
00:15:31 like the most about Spain
00:15:33 when I think about my experiences in
00:15:35 Spain.  a very positive thing of a
00:15:40 lot of joy a lot of friendship a lot a lot
00:15:42 everything is a relaxed way of life and being
00:15:46 optimistic
00:15:50 yes I think it's true even when I went
00:15:52 when there was the whole issue of the
00:15:55 economic crisis and such people went on and on
00:15:58 having fun and having a good time
00:16:02 yes  No, yes, it
00:16:05 is a way of being and a way of being
00:16:12 in this world that I like
00:16:16 very well and well, thank you very much,
00:16:19 thank you for explaining to us the things you
00:16:22 like about Spain and Argentina,
00:16:26 and I hope that thanks to your
00:16:28 experience our listeners will also
00:16:32 Spanish students will also feel more
00:16:36 motivated to continue learning
00:16:37 Spanish. Well, I hope they continue
00:16:40 studying Spanish too, because I want to
00:16:42 be great at doing with life.
00:16:44 Remember, remember that
00:16:48 we are also going to make a video for the
00:16:50 olic en channel.  English and I leave you the link
00:16:54 in the description below so you can see his
00:16:55 channel because there and you also have
00:16:59 general advice not to learn a
00:17:02 language  s
00:17:03 yes yes several and you have made a series of
00:17:08 books to read to practice
00:17:10 Spanish too yes yes
00:17:14 we do one where we have an
00:17:17 hour
00:17:25 with one we complicate books let's say in
00:17:31 various ways but above all so that
00:17:35 what we try to produce are the
00:17:39 books for  start reading in Spanish
00:17:42 without the difficulty of a
00:17:45 normal book for native speakers,
00:17:49 very well, if you are interested
00:17:52 you can go to oli's channel and from there
00:17:55 also reach his books and good
00:17:58 luck, oli, thanks, that's right,
00:18:00 come again  To be continued a pleasure
00:18:02 goodbye
00:18:09 [Music]
00:18:11 and
00:18:12 [Music]
",3
180,"00:00:00 look look again how good this is the
00:00:03 most fun of all
00:00:06 [Music]
00:00:09 hello
00:00:12 we have come to eat on the island of that
00:00:16 goal which is an island it is not very close
00:00:19 it is not very far from bangkok it
00:00:21 is about three
00:00:23 hours but three and a half hours  in a
00:00:26 minibus and well we arrived yesterday and we
00:00:31 spent the night in a hotel and today is the
00:00:33 first day that we have the whole day
00:00:35 here on the island we have come three nights
00:00:39 because now Thursday and Friday are
00:00:42 holidays so we have a
00:00:45 weekend of  four days and we have
00:00:47 taken the opportunity to come to go
00:00:50 on vacation
00:00:53 and now I am going to dive I am going to dive a
00:00:55 bit we are at the southernmost tip of
00:00:59 the island in water
00:01:02 because if in the coral bay the coral bay
00:01:07 then I am going to dive a
00:01:10 Let's see what's up and well, Benítez, come
00:01:14 with me,
00:01:16 a lizard, a very big
00:01:19 lizard, the lizard, move
00:01:22 well, I think I'm going to go down here,
00:01:26 here it seems like a safe place to
00:01:28 enter the water, to enter and to exit
00:01:31 later,
00:01:34 not here and here  it seemed  I'm pretty
00:01:38 sure
00:01:40 I'll leave the flip-flops here so they don't
00:01:42 fall into the sea. Now there's something wrong with
00:01:46 the goggles, the diving goggles when you
00:01:49 get into the water sometimes they fog up they
00:01:53 fog up with humidity they don't fog up with
00:01:57 humidity with the heat of your face  so
00:02:00 there are several ways to prevent them from
00:02:03 fogging up one way is with a spray they
00:02:05 sell a spray to spray the
00:02:09 glasses another way is a potato with a
00:02:12 potato you cut it and scrub it you play with
00:02:16 the potato on the inside of the
00:02:18 glass
00:02:20 but today  I don't have spray
00:02:23 I don't have potatoes so well I'm going to use
00:02:27 the third option
00:02:30 and well wash it a little with water
00:02:33 so there isn't much there isn't much
00:02:36 saliva
00:02:42 and
00:02:43 press press a lot
00:02:49 with the fins and we go through
00:02:54 the water luckily the water is there  hot it's
00:02:58 quite quite hot i think that's the way it
00:03:02 is almost any beach in thailand
00:03:06 the water is quite warm it's
00:03:10 slippery that's why it's slippery
00:03:17 very well i'm already in the water look at my
00:03:20 blue fins how beautiful first
00:03:23 I put on the fins the left fin
00:03:27 very well and now the right fin let's see
00:03:31 ok that's good I take the camera out
00:03:35 one last time you can see that I already have the
00:03:38 glasses and the tube and now very well look
00:03:43 this is my face how handsome I am and  yes
00:03:46 I am going to leave the lid of the camera
00:03:49 floating here look look you see here
00:03:52 floating bothering because I am stupid
00:03:56 and I have not realized that I have left the
00:03:57 lid of the camera floating and we are going to see
00:04:01 that there is a fish two fish look there are
00:04:04 very fish  well and rocks

00:04:53 feet to move very well and in the
00:04:57 background look so you know that diving will
00:05:00 go to very deep places

00:05:04 typical video of bought with music or pretty  or
00:05:07 a urchin a sea urchin

00:06:02 there are many different types of coral another
00:06:05 urchin the urchins here are very big they
00:06:08 have very long spikes longer than
00:06:11 the urchins in spain in e  The Mediterranean
00:06:15 look at this school dead coral coral since
00:06:19 it is dead due to
00:06:23 climate change changes the chemistry of sea water
00:06:27 and many corals are dying look

00:06:46 ha
00:06:48 look this is like a chimney it is
00:06:51 shaped like a chimney but I think it
00:06:54 is also a coral that is made up of
00:06:56 a type of coral that grows in that way
00:06:59 look how many urchins
00:07:01 here there were many urchins together  And look at
00:07:04 the shell, how beautiful I found it, it's
00:07:07 a very beautiful shell. I'm going to take it with me,
00:07:10 I'm going to keep it.
00:07:12 I think it's still alive. Look,
00:07:14 if it's still alive inside, I'm going to
00:07:18 take it with me to show it to
00:07:20 my wife, but I'll return it later.
00:07:23 I'll bring it back to the sea so it doesn't
00:07:25 die
00:07:26 look how many urchins there are a lot of
00:07:29 urchins here you have to be careful with
00:07:32 the urchins they are dangerous if you
00:07:35 touch or step on them you could  is to do a
00:07:38 lot of damage look look how

00:08:06 very fast it is a very fast fish I show you
00:08:09 my face a little more that you
00:08:12 have not seen it for a long time and it moves away dive a
00:08:16 little deeper
00:08:18 you have to compensate you have to hold your
00:08:20 nose  To compensate for the air pressure
00:08:24 in your ears and not hurt your
00:08:27 ears when you go diving to submerge
00:08:31 several meters, you have to be careful.
00:08:34 Look at these, they are also corals. These
00:08:37 are still alive, but you can see that it has
00:08:40 this shape. This is quite a coral.
00:08:43 quite typical acquaintance let's see if I can
00:08:46 find something around here through the holes let's
00:08:48 see what's around here and look how many

00:09:29 I went snorkeling again I put it
00:09:32 here in the same video so as not to make two
00:09:35 different videos look how many fish there are
00:09:40 66 fish are very similar to the color of
00:09:44 the rocks and the sand they camouflage themselves
00:09:47 very well
00:09:50 and here a school of fish from  many
00:09:53 very small fish look look they move all
00:09:57 together all at the same time

00:11:06 broken coral coral dead coral in pieces of
00:11:10 coral that has died and have
00:11:13 broken already these clams seem
00:11:16 incredible to me in the mediterranean we don't have
00:11:18 this we don't have anything like this and so so
00:11:21 big molluscs so big look at it
00:11:24 they get into all the holes in the rock
00:11:27 be any hole in the rock look
00:11:30 this is another type of clam these
00:11:33 do close completely and are scary
00:11:37 they don't seem very pointy they can
00:11:40 prick you don't put your finger inside they
00:11:42 look dangerous
00:11:47 look look again what  well this is the
00:11:50 most fun of all more fun than
00:11:52 anything else
00:11:54 look here there is more is that these in the
00:11:56 mediterranean' I have not seen in Spain either
00:11:59 I have not seen and it has  They are very funny,
00:12:02 look, look, what is there? We have here. They
00:12:07 are the most interesting fish I saw. They
00:12:10 are puffer fish like those eaten in
00:12:15 Japan. They are poisonous fish. They have poison
00:12:19 if you eat them, you can die and they
00:12:23 can prick you with poison if you bother them
00:12:26 like that.  Don't bother them jce don't get
00:12:29 too close but they are very very interesting fish
00:12:34 look here we'll see you again if
00:12:38 you get close they can confront you they don't just run away
00:12:41 but once I ran into
00:12:44 one and it faced me like it was going
00:12:48 to attack me until  I left so be
00:12:51 careful with the puffer fish

187,"00:00:00 if you remember the video about the war
00:00:05 the war of independence between
00:00:09 france and spain at the end at the end of the
00:00:14 war france let ferdinand the seventh
00:00:18 return to spain and ferdinand
00:00:24 becomes the king of spain again he
00:00:28 becomes king again king of spain  and the people, the
00:00:32 Spaniards had high hopes, they
00:00:36 expected the king to do good things,
00:00:43 but
00:00:47 [Music]
00:00:50 hello, well, if today I am going to talk about the
00:00:56 reign of Ferdinand the Seventh between 1814 and
00:01:05 1833, then after protecting Spain
00:01:12 from protecting Spain from the French, the
00:01:16 Spaniards were  a little tired and they
00:01:21 expected that Fernando the Seventh will improve
00:01:25 Spain that will begin to adopt some
00:01:29 ideas ideas of the Enlightenment ideas of
00:01:34 a more modern state no but several
00:01:39 important people people
00:01:43 around the king's circle give him the
00:01:48 manifesto of the Persians manifesto
00:01:52 and the Persians with  The one they
00:01:56 ask asks the king to return to the old
00:01:59 regime to return to the
00:02:03 absolute monarchy that the king decides everything then  it is
00:02:07 the king accepts the king says very well and the
00:02:12 king annuls the constitution during the
00:02:16 war with france in the courts of
00:02:19 cadiz the courts of cadiz approved a
00:02:22 constitution the king annuls it annuls the
00:02:28 constitution and the king once again has
00:02:32 all the power in this  moment
00:02:36 napoleon falls napoleon let's see napoleon
00:02:40 napoleon of france is also defeated
00:02:43 loses his wars then the
00:02:47 monarchies of europe the different
00:02:50 kings of europe i don't know where where there were
00:02:54 kings the kings of europe the monarchies
00:02:58 make a pact a pact to protect themselves
00:03:02 to protect each other  the others
00:03:05 to protect themselves from the ideas of the
00:03:09 Enlightenment of the modern state to
00:03:12 protect themselves against liberalism, not in
00:03:16 any country when
00:03:19 the people rebelled against the king well they
00:03:23 were punished they were punished
00:03:27 and at this time many people fled many
00:03:32 people  he leaves spain he leaves spain
00:03:36 to avoid being punished by the
00:03:41 king so ferdinand the seventh also does not
00:03:46 do very good esp  year does not have
00:03:50 money also there were the Spanish-American wars of
00:03:54 independence the
00:03:57 wars in which the countries of America
00:04:01 become independent separate from Spain
00:04:05 we already talked about this in the last video
00:04:08 so spain has even less and
00:04:12 less money then the liberals the
00:04:16 people who were left  in spain that
00:04:19 had not fled they began to think how they
00:04:23 could remove the king how they could
00:04:26 overthrow the king
00:04:29 in 1820 riots begin they begin to
00:04:35 see uprisings riots begin to
00:04:39 see well people protesting in
00:04:42 different cities of spain they even
00:04:45 surround the palace the royal palace well i
00:04:48 'm going to  draw a castle that although it
00:04:50 was not a medieval castle but they
00:04:53 begin to surround the palace the palace
00:04:58 of the king they surround it so here ferdinand the
00:05:02 seventh decides to accept saying okay and
00:05:06 accepts the constitution then
00:05:10 the liberal triennium begins the liberal triennium is
00:05:14 a triennium because it was three years
00:05:17 only three years and here laws begin to be
00:05:22 created
00:05:23 laws to change  the system and there are two
00:05:28 two sides there is no one side two do not leave
00:05:32 and one side looks for changes
00:05:36 but few small changes and the side
00:05:41 looks for big changes
00:05:44 drastic changes and while the two sides
00:05:48 are arguing to see what changes they
00:05:51 make what changes  They don't carry out a
00:05:54 military coup, the army tries to
00:05:57 return to absolutism, to return
00:06:02 to the king having all the power, but it
00:06:04 fails, the army can't carry out the
00:06:07 coup, so a bit as a
00:06:11 reaction to this attack by the army,
00:06:15 the most radical  the most progressive
00:06:19 get more power in the government
00:06:22 then the absolutists the people in
00:06:27 favor
00:06:29 of absolutism the absolutists see that
00:06:32 they have no choice and ask for help from the
00:06:36 other european countries to this pact to the
00:06:40 pact between the european monarchies
00:06:43 then the monarchies meet in
00:06:47 verona  In the Verona congress of 1822
00:06:53 and they approve an intervention, they decide to
00:06:57 intervene to enter Spain
00:07:01 to relocate the king, then the army
00:07:05 The French army enters Spain, the army
00:07:09 also not the military, the French
00:07:13 army enters Spain and the
00:07:16 King of the King is taken to Cádiz. The King is taken to Cádiz.
00:07:26 Spaniards now had a problem they
00:07:29 had no money they had no help
00:07:34 gold and things food coming from
00:07:38 the americas the other european countries
00:07:41 were also in favor of the king so
00:07:45 fernando seventh business fernando says
00:07:50 come on give up spanish
00:07:53 hostage god i will be king again but
00:07:57 I will maintain the constitution I will maintain
00:08:00 the changes that you have decided
00:08:03 no then okay they surrender they accept but
00:08:08 then the king does not do what he said no
00:08:11 the king eliminates the reforms eliminates the
00:08:15 laws that have been made during the three
00:08:19 years of the liberal triennium then well
00:08:23 the  king begins with repression begins to
00:08:27 get rid of removing government posts
00:08:30 the most important people
00:08:33 during the liberal triennium begins to
00:08:37 get rid of him  The
00:08:39 most progressive people are removed
00:08:43 from the government but still the
00:08:47 Spanish people begin to think that
00:08:51 absolutism that the king has all the
00:08:54 power they begin to see it as something of the
00:08:57 past as something old so despite
00:09:01 the king
00:09:02 several people various positions  from the
00:09:05 government several ministers who are beginning to
00:09:08 enter are also progressive
00:09:12 people people who seek reforms seek to
00:09:16 modernize the state so it must be
00:09:19 said that Fernando seventh did not have
00:09:23 sons he had his queen no and they
00:09:29 had daughters but they had no sons they did not
00:09:32 have any son who could inherit
00:09:35 that he could be king in the future he had
00:09:38 two daughters two daughters but by law a
00:09:42 woman could not inherit
00:09:44 the throne she could not become queen
00:09:48 so ferdinand when he was sick
00:09:51 he eliminates this law erases the law the law
00:09:56 that says that only men
00:10:00 can be king  in he eliminates her and says that
00:10:04 his daughter isabel his daughter isabel will be queen
00:10:08 when he dies so here come
00:10:12 the ultras reali  These are also a group of
00:10:16 people who say no, that a woman
00:10:19 cannot inherit, she cannot be queen, that it
00:10:23 has to be a man, and saying that
00:10:25 the king, the next king, has to be
00:10:29 Carlos María Isidro, Carlos María Isidro,
00:10:33 who is the brother of the brother of the
00:10:36 Then the royalist ultras talk to
00:10:41 María Cristina they talk to the
00:10:44 king's wife and they tell her when Fernando dies
00:10:50 you will be the queen you will be the regent queen
00:10:53 we are not going to help you nobody
00:10:57 nobody is going to help you nobody is going to
00:11:01 love you as queen nobody  He is going to want
00:11:04 your daughter to make Isabella queen so
00:11:08 Maria Cristina talks to Fernando and
00:11:11 convinces him to get Fernando to say okay
00:11:16 when I die it will be Carlos it will be Carlos
00:11:19 the king but Fernando who was
00:11:23 sick doesn't really die he
00:11:26 recovers if he is healthy again  and then he sees what
00:11:30 has happened, he realizes that the
00:11:34 royalist ultras have influenced his wife, they
00:11:37 have talked to his wife to
00:11:40 convince him, so he says no, that Carlos is
00:11:44 not going to be king  That his heiress
00:11:48 once again becomes Isabel
00:11:51 and made her brother from Spain,
00:11:55 she tells Carlos to leave, to
00:11:58 leave Spain, what he did then Carlos
00:12:01 Carlos leaves, he goes to Portugal and
00:12:04 from Portugal he continues thinking about how
00:12:07 to be  the king being king of
00:12:11 spain then in 1833 he finally dies
00:12:17 ferdinand the seventh dies and
00:12:21 the regency of maría cristina begins
00:12:26 regency means that she works
00:12:29 as if she were the queen but only
00:12:33 temporarily only for a while no
00:12:35 but this regency is difficult it is
00:12:39 quite difficult  Because there really aren't
00:12:42 many people, there aren't many people
00:12:45 who support it, it doesn't have the support of
00:12:49 a part of the people and it doesn't have the support
00:12:52 of the military, so
00:12:55 that same year
00:12:58 in 1833 a part of the people, a part
00:13:03 of Spain, rose up.  a war
00:13:06 begins a war begins in favor of carlos and
00:13:10 the first carlist war begins the
00:13:15 carlist war against isabelinos
00:13:18 a war between 1833 and 1840 then
00:13:26 isabel and carlos not isabel and carlos
00:13:30 so the most
00:13:33 traditionalist, most conservative people
00:13:36 fight on carlos's side and the people
00:13:40 who are looking for some change of change in
00:13:43 the state in the government fight
00:13:46 on isabel's side you know who
00:13:50 won which of the two sides won
00:13:53 write it down write it in the
00:13:56 comments
00:13:57 okay in the next video we will talk about
00:14:01 who won who managed to win
00:14:04 this war this civil war in spain

145,"00:00:00 hello tomás how are
00:00:03 you excellent you very well very well but a
00:00:07 little boring no or yes
00:00:16 yes we are at home here in
00:00:19 thailand
00:00:21 there are people who go to work they can go
00:00:23 to work but apart from that well
00:00:26 we are at home
00:00:30 [Music]
00:00:32 you are  in mexico in mexico in mexico city
00:00:38 that's how it is and how is the situation there
00:00:44 well here the situation we are
00:00:47 entering the curve is rising a lot now
00:00:51 we are going to enter may and it is going to
00:00:54 get a lot worse we are in phase 3 and it
00:01:00 is already spreading a lot  and they don't really
00:01:03 know where the infections come from,
00:01:06 who gets it, not in phase 3, clark, it's already
00:01:09 coming from heaven and at the volume video,
00:01:13 so bars and restaurants have already closed there,
00:01:17 or yes,
00:01:20 the essentials are okay, but the
00:01:25 offices people continue to go to  work at the
00:01:27 office and only the supermarkets and
00:01:30 the basics
00:01:34 if your work is essential, that is, if you
00:01:36 work in the health or
00:01:38 food area where you work, but if from
00:01:40 another profession, if not, it's not worth it, then
00:01:43 well, the  The situation is similar to Spain
00:01:47 now, of
00:01:48 course, in fact it is being compared
00:01:51 with Spain with Italy, yes,
00:01:55 many people have doubts, well,
00:01:58 how long will this last? No,
00:02:01 and when are we going to be able to get out of this
00:02:04 situation, but I have also heard
00:02:07 people  who are debating to see what effects
00:02:10 will have lasting effects
00:02:13 in what way our culture is going to change
00:02:15 our habits not
00:02:21 to change much because Hispanics
00:02:28 the culture of Spain in Latin America
00:02:31 we are quite warm people we don't like it
00:02:34 well we shake hands but we also
00:02:36 likes salt or hugging and such,
00:02:40 you think that this is going to change
00:02:43 and I think that the first months
00:02:46 after this is over there will be a
00:02:49 kind
00:02:51 of thinking twice of
00:02:54 fear of wanting to save some
00:02:56 hugging him because it's enough like  the term
00:02:58 trauma spent so much time that
00:03:00 we were without touching each other
00:03:02 and that on the one hand but I also think that you
00:03:04 will see many Latinos who do
00:03:06 the opposite, the more you are going to  come back and you're going to
00:03:11 have physical contact there's going to be a
00:03:14 reaction, a counter reaction and say no
00:03:17 no I don't want to lose this I don't want to
00:03:19 lose hugging and kissing and such and they
00:03:22 're going to do it more to see how it's going to
00:03:28 be because of course
00:03:30 now while we're  At home
00:03:33 we are not very much in that situation of
00:03:36 meeting someone and doubting whether to
00:03:39 shake hands, not because we simply
00:03:41 do not meet other people anymore,
00:03:44 but of course what will happen if
00:03:48 after the worst thing, which is where
00:03:50 we are now, it comes to a  situation
00:03:53 in which there are fewer sick people, fewer
00:03:56 infections, people go back to work
00:04:00 but for a while for a year or
00:04:03 so and there are still sick people and
00:04:07 we are in a situation of valls and
00:04:09 we go to work we go out into the street but
00:04:12 we try to keep our distance  And
00:04:15 if this is prolonged, if this lasts a long
00:04:17 time,
00:04:17 in what way can this last and can it
00:04:20 change the culture, what do you think?
00:04:23 Yes, I think so.
00:04:25 height and we are going
00:04:29 to lose a lot of the identity of
00:04:30 Latinos, which is classic, I don't know when
00:04:33 I kiss you in Spain, I know that
00:04:35 the prisoners
00:04:37 in Spain greet each other, CO2 drops, as it is on the 22nd of
00:04:41 Mexico, only one but nothing called a
00:04:44 hug, enough, that is, there is  a lot of contact
00:04:47 some contact so if that is
00:04:50 lost it
00:04:52 is quite strange it would be like not being
00:04:54 in Latin America sir it would feel very
00:04:58 different I think that things like that
00:05:01 have happened in the past not because of issues I
00:05:04 don't know because of wars or things like that it has
00:05:06 changed a bit  the relationship between
00:05:09 people the way of being
00:05:10 I would also prefer that it not be
00:05:13 lost no but you see
00:05:17 even good sites in places like
00:05:19 in the USA
00:05:21 I know a site like in the USA maybe
00:05:23 it happens in other places too but there are people
00:05:25 who don't like it  I like to shake hands because they already
00:05:27 say that it is not very hygienic that you
00:05:32 can also transmit microbes
00:05:34 diseases whatever and that without being
00:05:37 in the situation as we are now, it
00:05:40 was already happening before, well
00:05:43 Well, if it wouldn't be strange if
00:05:47 we started to be a little more, well, like
00:05:49 those countries, like other European countries,
00:05:51 for example, where perhaps there is more
00:05:54 distance between people,
00:05:57 yes, yes, I absolutely don't know what other
00:06:01 ways it can change, what do you think, is
00:06:05 there any other way?  How could
00:06:06 society change?
00:06:10 Yes, I believe that it will change in this
00:06:12 aspect, it could happen, as
00:06:15 I also think that the way of working that is no
00:06:19 longer going to be essential to have to
00:06:21 go to work in person,
00:06:24 but rather that it will exist and
00:06:27 will  normalize a lot of working from
00:06:30 home but I think that this is going now with
00:06:36 everything we are experiencing has taken a
00:06:37 lot of strength. They have thought that
00:06:41 remote work or teleworking from
00:06:44 the grain
00:06:46 I think that this option is going to be
00:06:48 practically the same as working in
00:06:52 person  no, it will not be ready,
00:06:54 in fact, quite the opposite, it will be
00:06:57 encouraged and programs will be created and
00:06:59 it will be encouraged that this can happen and
00:07:02 surely what has been seen  If it's
00:07:04 ready, check that it's a bit
00:07:06 scary, what happens if there is a regrowth, if
00:07:10 again,
00:07:13 then it's so prepared that it can
00:07:16 start working remotely, of course, it may
00:07:19 be that companies already want to have the
00:07:21 system ready, have that option
00:07:23 ready just in case.  what happens
00:07:26 but also many companies that until
00:07:29 now were reticent that until now did not
00:07:32 want their employees to work from
00:07:34 home because they were afraid that they would be
00:07:38 lazy or that they would not work that
00:07:40 they were wasting their time, perhaps they are
00:07:44 forced and they realize  It's good that it
00:07:46 works that people continue working,
00:07:51 perhaps the employees are happy
00:07:54 because they don't have to waste time or
00:07:56 travel by car, on the
00:07:59 bus, on the subway to go to work or
00:08:01 not,
00:08:02 and what happens that the
00:08:04 workers have already given up?  Keep in mind that they can
00:08:06 do it in the future, not if the boss
00:08:10 tries to say, well, now that
00:08:12 you can see the office, the worker
00:08:14 will say why.  We know that I can
00:08:16 work from home, of
00:08:19 course, that debate is going to be opened
00:08:21 absolutely because it was proven
00:08:23 that
00:08:25 it could be done by force and it was possible to
00:08:28 get ahead like that, so now that
00:08:31 the conditions are going to be in
00:08:33 effect, the jobs are going to
00:08:35 act on them, but because I have  to go or they
00:08:37 can negotiate look out of the five days
00:08:39 the weeks only two I want to go to
00:08:41 work and all three I can do the
00:08:43 work from my home through the
00:08:46 computer I know why not I don't know how it is
00:08:49 in Mexico but in Spain when
00:08:52 workers get a  right when
00:08:55 the workers have something, it is something
00:08:57 that is no longer touched, that you never take it from them,
00:08:59 you will never take it away from them,
00:09:03 and here Mexico is a bit similar, the formula has already been
00:09:05 tested, it worked, so it
00:09:08 also worked so that they can ask to
00:09:10 join  Absolutely
00:09:12 [Music]
00:09:15 and what about other things in
00:09:17 terms of ways perhaps to play fewer
00:09:21 things because in recent years there are already
00:09:25 many, many public
00:09:28 toilets, many sinks  public where there are sensors
00:09:31 you can't put on the sensor the water comes out
00:09:34 you don't have to touch the tap you don't have
00:09:36 to touch something common that everyone
00:09:38 touches no
00:09:40 and that's also good it's becoming more
00:09:44 and more they're not looking for ways to
00:09:46 avoid touching having  to touch things that
00:09:49 other people have touched of course if that is
00:09:53 also good in mexico in that
00:09:56 sense of the bathrooms they are the
00:09:58 public bathrooms of the cinemas of the restaurants
00:10:00 they are not as modern
00:10:06 as very wealthy for example it does not exist
00:10:09 here unlike in the USA it is basic  and
00:10:13 this little piece of paper that is put on the
00:10:16 toilet to sit on is normal, the toilet is not
00:10:20 satisfied here, I think that now
00:10:23 they are going to establish it and basel are mandatory,
00:10:26 you have to do it yourself, you have
00:10:28 to put the toilet paper and plasters
00:10:30 to give  All this around the corner does not have
00:10:33 to be manufactured here anywhere in
00:10:35 any bathroom in Mexico, yes, I saw it
00:10:38 in Japan in some places, yes, there was
00:10:41 paper to cover to put it in
00:10:43 the toilet bowl, but  ro here yes here in
00:10:46 thailand never never never never see that
00:10:50 but it may be that more people well in more
00:10:54 places don't start putting it up I
00:10:56 think they are going to incorporate it a lot and also
00:10:59 what you say since May
00:11:01 that is ham which is with sensor  and that you throw yourself
00:11:04 into the foam soap and it will not appeal soap
00:11:08 if the water the water I see it bad sometimes the
00:11:11 soap also comes out with a yes with a
00:11:13 sensor and a lot
00:11:16 [Music]
00:11:18 if not the ones that are not that you do not have to
00:11:21 use well  the same towel as other
00:11:23 people
00:11:25 are paper stars that are for
00:11:28 single use or the air one that you don't have to
00:11:30 touch something in common with other people
00:11:35 I don't know maybe even sometimes we
00:11:39 have to press buttons it's not like
00:11:42 that we have to touch  You have to touch the button
00:11:43 in an elevator or whatever.
00:11:46 I don't know if people are going to get used to it.
00:11:49 Now I use my elbow a lot to press
00:11:51 the elevator buttons and I don't know if
00:11:54 there are people who are going to get used to
00:11:56 doing it.  to use the elbow or to use the feet
00:12:00 to open the doors and co  You're like that if
00:12:03 those things are read
00:12:06 I think I'll digitalize those that you
00:12:10 touch and that have to do with
00:12:12 the fingertips that's why it looks like roots
00:12:14 normal buttons yes whatever with a
00:12:18 glove and breasts and in fact me now  This
00:12:22 coming week I'm going to move to
00:12:24 a new flat
00:12:25 and they have a fingerprint sensor to
00:12:28 enter the building.
00:12:36 Away
00:12:38 from home no but not now now I don't
00:12:41 want to use it of
00:12:43 course very lucky they give you the
00:12:45 card option you have a card too and
00:12:47 you can make pib with the card so
00:12:49 I'm going to use that
00:12:52 regarding whether his days will be
00:12:56 numbered  It may be that they begin to change them
00:12:58 and they begin to put a good code
00:13:01 either because in the end it is the same it will
00:13:04 be or put on a diet or with
00:13:06 normal keys of course or the
00:13:09 large numbers I said for
00:13:17 larger alcohol perhaps they will  Record
00:13:20 everywhere with buttons as big as if they were
00:13:23 n't toys, you have to be clear in order to be
00:13:26 able to play
00:13:28 clearly that we would be very funny
00:13:33 yes
00:13:36 yes well well I don't know maybe in the future
00:13:39 in a year
00:13:41 Tomás we can record another video and
00:13:44 see if it really  There are things that have
00:13:46 changed and that have remained that
00:13:48 way for now, these are our forecasts for
00:13:51 the future.
00:13:52 If it's good to do that exercise to
00:13:55 see if we get together
00:13:57 , we'll see, well, thank you, thank you,
00:14:00 Tomas, for helping me make this
00:14:02 video, okay, okay, there, Carmela.

142,"00:00:00 hello march hello dable today we are
00:00:04 dressed up and with costumes costumes well
00:00:10 today we are going to be two two ladies two
00:00:14 neighbors that's right josefina and maruja exactly
00:00:20 and let's see what josefina and maruja are going to talk about
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:28 oh
00:00:30 josefina
00:00:36 I escaped for a while to talk  with you
00:00:41 if you realized that Don César the one from
00:00:46 the chicken
00:00:55 shop in him and he says to the chicken shop the butcher shop the
00:00:58 butcher shop if the man who sells the
00:01:01 chickens is behind carlotti he is
00:01:06 serious about cheese but but if he has a
00:01:11 wife and children then that's why there  It is that there
00:01:15 is gossip if I saw them writing ceno
00:01:19 ticas and talking in the corner of the
00:01:23 store or maruja marujita marujita what are you telling me what are
00:01:27 you telling me
00:01:29 with this, everyone has to know this,
00:01:34 I know well I wanted to tell you
00:01:37 first before  of spreading gossip
00:01:40 throughout the neighborhood
00:01:42 but what do you think I saw them with my
00:01:45 own eyes stinging their eyes too and
00:01:49 writing letters and kissing each other
00:01:53 but this if the woman the woman finds out
00:01:56 this can be  many problems, well, all the
00:02:00 more reason to tell her
00:02:03 that it is not clear we cannot do
00:02:09 that to the woman no and what will happen to
00:02:14 the children who have two children who are
00:02:16 still in school no today I am going to
00:02:19 tell you something the eldest son  She's the same
00:02:23 age as Carlota, the one with the cheeses, that
00:02:27 is,
00:02:29 yes, yes, it's
00:02:32 good, she's a woman much much younger
00:02:35 than him,
00:02:36 but much younger.
00:02:46 the
00:02:48 pollero that was that it was like that I
00:02:52 saw them josefina and you know that gossip
00:02:57 is real
00:03:00 yes yes it is true because well
00:03:04 you were also right when the lady of the house
00:03:10 of the fifth of the fifth b
00:03:13 who was allied with her boss of the
00:03:15 office
00:03:17 and what  It happened, well, how many employees were not
00:03:21 harmed by that and
00:03:25 who helped them
00:03:28 cs maruja marujita
00:03:31 maruja
00:03:34 what would he do what would this this neighborhood
00:03:36 feel
00:03:38 I know I think the same thing I would do in
00:03:43 this neighborhood without josefina and without
00:03:46 maruja
00:03:48 and marujit  you know the son of a merce they
00:03:51 say that they have given him a promotion when
00:03:54 a promotion at work beyond that it
00:03:57 was about time yes but he is very convinced
00:04:01 he is very convinced he is saying it
00:04:03 there all over the world is that look  how much does he
00:04:05 charge my son
00:04:08 oh no no no no not all these how much
00:04:12 is the son charging well
00:04:14 look they say he is charging
00:04:19 three thousand euros
00:04:22 three thousand euros
00:04:25 don't listen to me because people are very
00:04:28 envious
00:04:31 but la mercè la merced la mercè is in
00:04:33 charge of saying it  It's true to everyone,
00:04:36 but he still paid me what
00:04:40 he owes me for the magazines I
00:04:42 bought the other day.
00:04:53 the fifty euros of the
00:04:57 creams that I sold him the other day in the
00:04:59 magazines with the perfume
00:05:02 if it's merche this deserves it
00:05:04 always has always been like this as long as you
00:05:08 leave me something he still hasn't returned me
00:05:14 cds music cds that I left him ten years ago  years
00:05:17 still not me  She has returned them. I don't think it
00:05:23 's that between us we're going from bad to
00:05:26 worse.
00:05:29 What would the neighbors do
00:05:32 without us? I think the best thing to
00:05:35 do is to form a neighborhood union and say
00:05:40 all these things that are happening in
00:05:43 the neighborhood and put order
00:05:47 well I think so marujita marujita
00:05:49 because if it's not us nobody here
00:05:52 is going to put order in the
00:05:54 morality of the neighbors be and
00:05:57 let me tell you one thing josefina nobody
00:05:59 has more morals and nobody knows more about the
00:06:02 neighborhood than us all admitted
00:06:05 Well, of course, of course, of course,
00:06:11 don't say more, don't say more,
00:06:14 I'm going to make the call right now, I'm going
00:06:17 to print it and I'm going to put it in each house
00:06:20 and I'm going to stick it on each door so that we can
00:06:22 start tomorrow, do you think it's
00:06:27 okay?  but the Carmen that doesn't come is the
00:06:29 Carmen that we didn't invite her, we didn't
00:06:32 take advantage of the meeting and we threw the bomb
00:06:37 the husband and the meat
00:06:41 very well very well they must be the
00:06:44 pamphlets so come if you need
00:06:47 some help or need someone  visa to
00:06:50 whoever you tell me and I spread the word of
00:06:52 course that if I print them right now I'll
00:06:56 give you the papers so you can stick them in

00:00:05 hello sandra
00:00:08 today I bring you
00:00:11 a riddle like this
00:00:18 and you have to guess what the
00:00:23 solution is
00:00:25 the answer what it is you have to guess
00:00:29 what happened ok
00:00:33 not very difficult please don't look at me
00:00:39 there is a man a man who is dead
00:00:44 wow
00:00:45 and this man is in a phone booth
00:00:50 I don't know if you remember before that there were
00:00:53 phone booths before we
00:00:57 had mobile phones, no, there were phone booths
00:01:02 and this man in the booth is
00:01:05 dead so you have to guess
00:01:10 why and you can only
00:01:16 ask questions ask yes or
00:01:20 no
00:01:22 questions you can ask me I don't know you
00:01:25 can ask him was he an old man yes
00:01:28 or no but you can't ask me how
00:01:31 old was the man
00:01:36 come on that man was sick
00:01:40 this man disease no he was
00:01:45 not sick he did not die  from kobe or anything if
00:01:56 that man
00:01:58 received bad news or a
00:02:02 surprise over the phone you mean yes it
00:02:06 was something surprising and he
00:02:10 died well no they didn't give him bad
00:02:15 news  They didn't say anything to him on the phone
00:02:17 that surprised us. Depot on the
00:02:22 phone, okay, that was my theory. The
00:02:26 man was killed by someone else, a
00:02:30 rookie, there wasn't another person, no, no,
00:02:35 no one killed him, no one killed him, he wanted to
00:02:38 kill this man.  he killed by
00:02:42 accident or anything not good before if those
00:02:46 phones have a good how to
00:02:51 say it agrees with me strap a cable yes
00:02:55 maybe
00:02:58 although I use the cable around his
00:03:01 head no he didn't hang to death let's say
00:03:06 suffocated with the telephone cable no
00:03:08 but hey you go  you are doing well you have to
00:03:12 find out how he died or not if the
00:03:15 death was an accident well accidentally
00:03:19 if it was an accident it was completely
00:03:22 there is an accident nobody wanted him to
00:03:25 die
00:03:27 let's see I don't know so it's something
00:03:32 related to the road because well
00:03:35 That's what he told me he didn't say that more or
00:03:37 less but he didn't die in isolation with the
00:03:44 cable it has nothing to do with the cable in
00:03:47 the death telephone cable no it has
00:03:50 nothing to do with the cable to the victim that
00:03:52 one like this no there
00:03:56 like a cable there is around the neck
00:03:59 I don't know the same he is a very short
00:04:03 man the phone fell on his head
00:04:06 the text
00:04:08 phone had to think a lot if it had
00:04:13 to be very short
00:04:14 the phone no he did not drop it on his head
00:04:17 head did not hit him on the head
00:04:23 to see an accident yes there are many
00:04:26 many ways a person can
00:04:29 die no it
00:04:33 's just that I don't know I'm thinking that it
00:04:36 could happen to me that I'm also very
00:04:38 clumsy that many accidents happen to me
00:04:41 every day these five  It's a bit strange the
00:04:46 way he died but in the end a
00:04:50 person can only die in certain
00:04:53 certain ways he
00:04:57 thinks I separated his heart his heart
00:05:02 wasn't the first thing that happened to him no he didn't
00:05:04 die because his heart stopped he didn't
00:05:07 have a heart attack  heart or a report,
00:05:09 the clear thing is that I say how
00:05:12 a person died, well, how does a person die when it
00:05:14 stops the heart, how does a
00:05:16 person die before, not even if it
00:05:19 wasn't a heart attack, you're not
00:05:21 dead if your heart stops,
00:05:25 but  clear as the cause the reason
00:05:29 why a person can die as
00:05:31 you have already said it may be that you are sick
00:05:33 no but you were not sick it may be that
00:05:37 you lack oxygen from fires of lack of
00:05:40 air but it was not what else it may be it may
00:05:44 be a  hit you might lose a lot of
00:05:48 blood there are not many ways
00:05:51 you can die the walk
00:05:54 the phone was stopped if the cabin
00:05:57 was closed the door well the
00:06:01 doors are not normally they are not like that
00:06:04 but well the door here was
00:06:09 closed it was closed because  He has said
00:06:11 that it is not due to lack of oxygen, no, I
00:06:14 am not due to Salesian suffocation, well, the
00:06:19 man could breathe, the thing is
00:06:22 underwater, nor are
00:06:26 those things in the drawing windows,
00:06:30 those are those six things, if they are windows, they
00:06:33 are like the digital ones in the cabin.
00:06:36 so the ones that were good were closed
00:06:39 the windows are fixed I don't know they do
00:06:43 n't open the door was already closed
00:06:48 they are also not broken or anything I don't know that's
00:06:52 a question they are broken ah
00:06:56 now they're broken the windows
00:07:02 were broken by the man yes it was the man
00:07:07 who broke the windows he
00:07:12 broke exactly he was very fat
00:07:18 you're not going I wasn't very fat I'm not
00:07:22 thinking about strange things sometimes and there
00:07:25 wasn't a moment when I couldn't breathe
00:07:27 and he said I have to break this to
00:07:31 breathe no no he did not have austrophobia
00:07:36 he was afraid of closed places no no he
00:07:40 was not afraid and such before breaking the
00:07:44 windows the man had no
00:07:47 problem
00:07:51 if the man broke the windows he
00:07:55 broke them because of something he heard  in the call it
00:07:59 was not it was not because of what he heard in the
00:08:02 call it was not because of something that god was
00:08:05 not it was not because of something that was happening at that
00:08:08 moment it was not because of something that happened
00:08:11 inside the mine it was not as a reaction to something
00:08:17 that  It happened in the booth like this it's more
00:08:19 like something
00:08:21 in his head so you could say that
00:08:26 I'm close but I don't know I
00:08:31 had a mental problem I didn't have
00:08:35 mental problems so I can give you
00:08:43 a clue it's something related to the
00:08:47 call with what  e was saying
00:08:50 during the call but I asked you
00:08:54 before that if it was because of something on the call
00:08:57 I don't think today or that but it was not
00:09:02 because of something that I expected that he says
00:09:04 I know something that he was saying on the
00:09:07 call is not there
00:09:12 [Music  ]
00:09:13 is trying to deceive someone to tell
00:09:17 a lie so he wants to create that
00:09:20 noise of breaking glass yes on the
00:09:24 call he tries to convince someone to
00:09:26 lie to someone to tell him they are
00:09:28 attacking me they are hurting me or something
00:09:31 no
00:09:32 no it is more more nonsense than that the
00:09:37 another person the person he is talking to
00:09:39 knows what is happening you know what
00:09:42 is happening he knows he knows that this
00:09:46 man is breaking the windows this
00:09:48 person let's see the question is a bit
00:09:51 difficult because the man is not there
00:09:55 breaking the windows on purpose  and it's not
00:09:58 an accident, it's cut off, well, it's
00:10:01 breaking the windows by accident,
00:10:03 so well, the person on the phone well,
00:10:07 he hears it, he doesn't hear that the windows are
00:10:09 breaking and that's good, I have to
00:10:12 guess the  cause of death is that it is
00:10:15 cut with crystals yes yes the cause
00:10:18 I don't know
00:10:19 if you had already imagined it I suppose that it has been
00:10:21 imagined for a long time but you have
00:10:23 to guess why not if yes
00:10:26 then if it is cut why that is, it
00:10:29 dies because  he cuts himself with the glass
00:10:32 and loses a lot of blood, no, but if you have
00:10:35 to guess why because it breaks the
00:10:38 glass,
00:10:40 it could be anything, he assured
00:10:42 that he wouldn't be able to guess for years, well,
00:10:46 but you can ask questions and if
00:10:50 that's what I'm doing, let's see now.
00:10:53 Because of a bet you are
00:10:55 missing two things that you don't know yet,
00:10:58 one is who is he
00:11:01 talking to and another is what he's
00:11:04 talking about it's not a game anymore no no no they
00:11:09 are not playing they are not betting money
00:11:13 to see who wins money  he's not
00:11:17 talking to a child he's a
00:11:20 minor no he's not talking to a child
00:11:25 a policeman this man not the good the
00:11:28 person he's talking to the person
00:11:31 I hope he'll come back aversion to the person on
00:11:34 the other end of the phone  ono
00:11:38 it's not it's not a policeman's
00:11:41 family if it's his family his
00:11:46 wife if his wife is worth it you say that the
00:11:50 man doesn't want to make the woman believe something
00:11:53 no it's not a lie the man
00:11:57 accidentally breaks the windows
00:12:00 accidentally it's totally an accident  and
00:12:03 they break them with his body if he physically breaks it
00:12:06 with his body
00:12:10 what do you have to do by then
00:12:13 I already have a person he is talking to his
00:12:14 wife and now I have to know about what
00:12:16 because in what way
00:12:20 I don't know if he was taking off his clothes
00:12:22 anyway
00:12:24 no  he was taking our clothes off a
00:12:28 normal call it
00:12:30 's like there's a bit left to hit
00:12:32 but surely
00:12:33 I can give you a clue the
00:12:38 man was talking about something he was
00:12:41 telling explaining something to his wife that
00:12:45 he had done earlier that day
00:12:47 ok ok then it's  explaining something
00:12:51 and by accident he breaks the windows it
00:12:53 could be anything something with a lot of
00:12:56 movement no and the thing he was doing was
00:13:00 something with a lot of movement no not with a lot of
00:13:03 movement and the movement that  he does
00:13:07 to break the windows it is not because
00:13:10 it is an activity in which
00:13:13 he has to move a lot it is
00:13:15 related to the man's work it
00:13:19 is not his job
00:13:21 at work it is not his job but I
00:13:26 can give you a clue it is a  hobby is a
00:13:30 hobby
00:13:31 with p is that there are people who have
00:13:34 very strange hobbies
00:13:36 but it is a good hobby for sure it is a
00:13:38 normal hobby a hobby that yes that
00:13:41 many people have that they do on the
00:13:44 weekend and
00:13:47 maybe on the weekend
00:13:51 they go they go  to do this this hobby he was
00:13:56 going like he was fishing he was doing
00:13:59 something related to fishing and well yes
00:14:04 then if the hobby was fishing no but
00:14:08 he didn't move his arms to
00:14:10 pretend he was fishing he was already running away from a
00:14:14 shark no there was no swimming there was no
00:14:19 shark  he fell into the water and swam to no this
00:14:25 day no he had not had to swim he made a
00:14:28 movement of his arms for another reason for
00:14:31 another reason
00:14:34 this movement will be in the final
00:14:36 confiscate if it is related to his
00:14:40 hobby with with fishing
00:14:44 of  the cane to bring things closer
00:14:47 but it's a gesture it's something it's a kind
00:14:50 of gesture the man was making it
00:14:52 's a gesture with his arms yes your
00:14:59 arms fell into the water and help help no no no
00:15:03 the name this day I don't know  fell into the water I
00:15:07 didn't have to swim you mean when I was
00:15:10 fishing when I was fishing
00:15:14 if the man could he could be on land
00:15:17 here fishing
00:15:19 [Music] you
00:15:22 want to know I want to guess what's
00:15:25 left very little very little I see it was a
00:15:29 good day of fishing it was a very  good day of
00:15:33 fishing because there was a very big test there was
00:15:36 a very big fish and it escaped there was not
00:15:40 a very very big fish very big
00:15:44 really if it was very big it
00:15:49 was a very very big fish ok and he
00:15:53 managed to catch it yes he managed to catch the
00:15:57 fish and  Reeling in the fish is not the gesture
00:15:59 of pulling a very fat person no no with the
00:16:03 rod not having sandra imagine you
00:16:07 imagine that you are going to show yourself I have
00:16:11 another idea but tell me come
00:16:13 use a net I did not fish with size with a
00:16:17 fishing rod
00:16:19 imagine that  you fish is a very fish
00:16:24 very big very very very big and you are telling me
00:16:28 what happened
00:16:31 and so with my arms I don't break the
00:16:36 windows no but it's almost a gesture of
00:16:39 this duty action no no no it's not
00:16:42 really a celebration tell
00:16:45 me tell me what happened
00:16:50 that gentleman if tell me  what happened wow

00:17:26 explaining the
00:17:33 huge man didn't realize and  His wife
00:17:37 didn't see him, she didn't see his gesture, but a
00:17:41 fish that big
00:17:44 and
00:17:48 good has cost us a lot, but well, it has
00:17:55 been difficult, yes, but well, with the

00:00:05 Hello, I'm here at the Christmas market
00:00:10 in Barcelona, ​​the Christmas market, which
00:00:14 is where they sell various things
00:00:16 related to Christmas, and we'll
00:00:19 see, let's see what things are on, let's see what
00:00:23 we see here, a very
00:00:26 important part of  christmas is the manger and
00:00:31 here they sell things related to the
00:00:33 manger or the nativity scene
00:00:37 and the manger is
00:00:39 the nativity scene of jesus the
00:00:42 birth of jesus and here behind you can
00:00:46 see the stable that the stable the stable
00:00:49 is where the animals live where they live
00:00:51 the cows and that it is the place where
00:00:54 jesus was supposedly born
00:00:57 and here you can see that they sell the
00:00:59 decorations for that manger for the
00:01:02 nativity scene for the scene of the birth of
00:01:05 jesus they sell the decoration and they sell
00:01:08 figures they sell the different figures the
00:01:11 figure of the baby of jesus from  Mary the
00:01:14 mother of Jesus
00:01:16 and good in a whole collection of figures
00:01:19 and many of these stores sell these
00:01:23 figures for decoration of the nativity scene they sell
00:01:27 shepherds they sell the kings the three kings
00:01:31 magi who went to give gifts to jesus and
00:01:36 there are also simply
00:01:37 decorations christmas decorations for the house
00:01:41 and sometimes well other things other things
00:01:44 that can be given as
00:01:46 christmas gifts
00:01:51 and decorations not christmas lights and more
00:01:54 decorations and figures for the nativity scene
00:01:58 There are many, many stores
00:02:01 over the manger over the nativity scene. I
00:02:04 suppose there are still many families there that
00:02:06 make the nativity scene that make the nativity scene at
00:02:10 home. Every year, every Christmas, they put up
00:02:13 the scene of the birth of Jesus. I used to
00:02:16 do it when I was little, we did it in my
00:02:18 home and well it seems that there are still
00:02:20 people who accept it
00:02:23 and if you know the nativity scene in Spain in
00:02:27 Catalonia you will know that there is something a
00:02:29 little different there is something that is
00:02:32 in the nativity scene in Catalonia that is not very
00:02:35 normal in other places that  it is the
00:02:38 kagan the caganer is a shepherd a shepherd
00:02:42 who is sitting who is doing
00:02:44 caracas he is normally there well in the
00:02:47 manger in the field in front of
00:02:50 where jesus was born  no and he is a pastor who
00:02:54 has come to visit he has come to
00:02:57 see jesus christ
00:02:59 but hey he has to poop he has
00:03:01 to give a sink so he is
00:03:03 pooping no and well this meat is
00:03:07 now so famous that many people want to
00:03:11 buy these two  of cabanes so they
00:03:14 have made versions of famous people of
00:03:16 many characters and famous people
00:03:19 have their version of the channel and you can see
00:03:24 a lot, a lot of different of
00:03:27 course famous people not like
00:03:29 politicians like putin
00:03:32 trump but I also don't know the simpsons and
00:03:35 now the money
00:03:37 many  fictional characters and surely we will
00:03:41 see more there are more stores that sell and
00:03:43 carry ers that come sell the shepherd
00:03:45 [ __ ]
00:03:46 but many, as you can see, many are
00:03:48 decorations from manger collections
00:03:50 for the Christmas manger
00:03:53 here more figures more caganers more expensive
00:03:56 is like not
00:03:58 the traditional one  the classic is a shepherd
00:04:01 a shepherd with the red beret with the
00:04:04 red cap and let's see what else there is not everything
00:04:07 is caganers and not all on the manger
00:04:10 not all stores sell things for
00:04:12 him for the manger many are simply
00:04:15 decoration christmas decorations like
00:04:18 these
00:04:19 above
00:04:23 and decorations with santa claus with a
00:04:27 snowman
00:04:30 candle holders with pine cones pineapples
00:04:32 are also very common as decoration and then
00:04:36 santa claus santa claus
00:04:38 [  Music]
00:04:41 there is something else that is the uncle
00:04:44 this is also very Catalan it is a
00:04:47 trunk the wooden trunk I don't know if you have
00:04:49 seen the other video in which I talk about the
00:04:52 uncle I talk about what the uncle's tradition is
00:04:54 but it is also a tradition of
00:04:57 catalonia from this area of ​​spain
00:04:58 around barcelona and it is a
00:05:02 tradition in which the uncle is a
00:05:04 good trunk there is a story to a whole
00:05:06 legend a story about the uncle and it is
00:05:09 a magical trunk it is a trunk that you can
00:05:12 sing a song and hit him
00:05:15 You hit him with the stick and the guy
00:05:19 sang he pooped every time but the poop is
00:05:22 really gifts, it's gifts for the
00:05:25 children in the house so it's something very,
00:05:29 very curious, very funny because it's not
00:05:32 very  and common is not
00:05:34 anywhere else
00:05:35 [Music]
00:05:39 and well people here I don't know why they
00:05:42 are not there they are eating you and singing
00:05:45 they were having a good time
00:05:49 oh and also the goals
00:05:52 Christmas trees now we are going to see them here oh
00:05:55 God, a lot of uncles also stuck in
00:05:58 the trunk, but they also sell trees,
00:06:01 not
00:06:02 Christmas trees, trees to decorate
00:06:05 the tree, it is also something very
00:06:08 common, very typical for Christmas, to
00:06:11 put at home as Christmas decorations,
00:06:14 both the Christmas tree and Santa
00:06:18 Claus.
00:06:19 Like Santa Claus, they are not typical Spanish things
00:06:22 , they are not traditional, they are not
00:06:26 original from Spain, they are imported things,
00:06:28 but
00:06:31 it is good that they are celebrated a lot and
00:06:33 when I was little, 20, 30, 30 years ago,
00:06:38 we already had a Christmas tree at home
00:06:40 then.  It was something that was already done, so
00:06:42 it's something that's been done for
00:06:44 quite some time,
00:06:46 but hey, things like the uncle or the
00:06:50 Christmas uncle and the three
00:06:55 wise men, well, it's something very, very
00:06:57 spanish the manger the scene of the
00:07:01 birth of jesus is something i don't know
00:07:04 very well i don't know if it's just i guess
00:07:07 it's not just spanish but
00:07:10 it's done in other countries but i
00:07:12 'm not sure i'm not sure in which countries it's
00:07:15 done and in which  country in which
00:07:18 countries the nativity scene is not made no
00:07:22 and well you can see that there is a lot of
00:07:25 variety you can make a nativity
00:07:28 scene make a nativity scene
00:07:30 with many many different figures
00:07:33 just like there is the caganer that poops
00:07:37 there is also the pleasant pee that pees of
00:07:39 course I had to  there is also the expression of
00:07:41 pipi and then there are a lot
00:07:44 of different animals different
00:07:46 options for animals for the
00:07:49 nativity scene
00:07:50 and well also in the christmas market
00:07:53 in barcelona there are more things like gifts
00:07:57 or decorations for the house
00:08:00 christmas decorations
00:08:02 more or less we have  Having seen everything there is,
00:08:04 I would say that half of the
00:08:07 stores are things for the manger, things
00:08:10 for him, for the nativity scene,
00:08:12 and the other half, well, we
00:08:14 have Christmas trees.  Christmas decorations
00:08:17 we have Christmas trees and then
00:08:21 some that are gifts, simply
00:08:22 things that people can buy to
00:08:25 give as gifts, especially to give
00:08:28 to children
00:08:31 and well, as you can see, it is
00:08:33 right in front of the cathedral, not here
00:08:36 is the market,
00:08:38 the market is  here is the square is
00:08:41 the plaza de la catedral
00:08:43 and here we have the cathedral the
00:08:45 cathedral of barcelona which is not the
00:08:48 sagrada familia the sagrada familia is
00:08:50 another church is in another side this is
00:08:53 the cathedral of barcelona and well i think
00:08:57 we can end here  we can finish
00:09:00 finish the video
00:09:02 come on
00:09:07 ah
00:09:10 ah
00:09:12 [Music]
",3
143,"00:00:02 We'll see what we're going to talk about today.
00:00:06 Well, today we're going to talk about
00:00:07 how the current situation affects us
00:00:10 personally and our countries, but
00:00:14 Spain and Panama.
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:24 Hello, how are you?
00:00:26 Hello, everything is fine here, yes, well, this
00:00:30 situation is good.  little bad is
00:00:33 unexpected and not what a horror
00:00:36 for us it is unexpected
00:00:40 historically it is not a novelty of the
00:00:43 past before there have been other epidemics
00:00:46 other pandemics but the internet factor
00:00:49 makes everything take on a much
00:00:53 larger scale something unprecedented in this way
00:00:58 and perhaps in the past
00:01:02 There weren't as many tools to deal
00:01:05 with one with these types of diseases
00:01:08 as we have today and today it
00:01:11 seems to us that we should be able to
00:01:13 do more to avoid these things and
00:01:17 that is why we feel perhaps even more
00:01:19 frustrated because we have not been able to
00:01:22 avoid something like this  How could it be that
00:01:25 something could appear that changes our
00:01:27 lives, even
00:01:30 if it gives you a lot to think about,
00:01:35 analyzing humanity itself, it grabs us
00:01:38 Starting the decade in such a way,
00:01:44 as many friends say,
00:01:46 nobody expected it and there is no way that
00:01:48 anyone could have foreseen it, let's
00:01:52 forget about conspiracy theories
00:01:55 and everything else, the rest of
00:01:57 humanity was not prepared
00:02:01 for the  consequences of living through a
00:02:03 pandemic
00:02:05 because many of us can be at home
00:02:07 we have food
00:02:10 we actually have the facility to
00:02:14 communicate online but there are many
00:02:18 more who do not have that fortune and it is
00:02:22 hitting it very hard
00:02:24 and you know that I have noticed that it is not so much it is not so
00:02:27 much the  pandemic is how we
00:02:30 collectively react to the pandemic yes of course
00:02:34 the reaction has many effects not
00:02:37 economic effects and such but the
00:02:41 pandemic without a reaction would also have
00:02:43 had very very large effects
00:02:46 surely worse no perez they could
00:02:49 have been exact creators and yes it is
00:02:53 true that there are people perhaps  It has
00:02:56 affected me relatively little.
00:02:58 I am very fortunate. I am very
00:03:01 fortunate because my work in general l  Or
00:03:04 I can do everything online
00:03:07 before and I was doing most of the things
00:03:10 online but there are many
00:03:12 people in our countries in Spain or
00:03:15 where
00:03:16 they don't have that fortune.
00:03:21 Well, it should be noted that there are people
00:03:26 who were already
00:03:28 more used
00:03:31 to what  doing work online,
00:03:35 in my case, I
00:03:38 work a lot with what is in the field
00:03:40 outside, not so much in an office.
00:03:44 That is why when we explain what we
00:03:46 do, you go and people will understand. I
00:03:49 dedicate myself mainly to audiovisual production
00:03:51 , concerts or recordings or
00:03:55 generating  video photography campaigns for
00:03:59 that requires
00:04:00 constantly working with a group of people
00:04:02 who are part of a production you have
00:04:06 collaborators other musicians not of course
00:04:10 lights team people who coordinate who
00:04:14 help who attend a lot of various but
00:04:19 hey everything that is entertainment
00:04:22 is on pause so well  I can't do that
00:04:25 I know why you did
00:04:27 live concerts too
00:04:29 and that of course closed all the bars and
00:04:31 concert halls
00:04:34 yes even the recording rooms
00:04:37 are still open but we are not teaching
00:04:42 because we are not going to perform soon
00:04:45 we are teaching so as not to forget what we
00:04:47 know
00:04:49 because when when you are going to do a
00:04:51 new concert maybe with
00:04:53 new
00:04:54 songs you work more in the studio rehearsing and
00:04:58 Well, that was one thing, the other thing I was
00:05:00 doing was assisting in soccer at
00:05:06 the non-professional student level, a
00:05:11 soccer team is worth saying flights or one, the
00:05:13 Arabs and well, we trained and we had
00:05:17 finished second in a tournament and
00:05:19 suddenly everything had to stop  and another
00:05:23 thing that I can't do the team no longer trains
00:05:26 yet no no yet they
00:05:28 can't have them individually
00:05:31 he sent them to run and do certain
00:05:33 dynamics online but it's not the same
00:05:36 we can't play team team games
00:05:40 for a longer period of
00:05:43 time
00:05:45 and third that this was not making him
00:05:48 as professional as the other two but
00:05:51 was instilling in teaching Spanish and
00:05:55 the truth  I'm not good at online classes,
00:05:58 I
00:06:00 much prefer being in person because of the type
00:06:04 of mechanisms that I was trying
00:06:06 to carry out, it is best to do
00:06:09 face-to-face communication in person
00:06:12 and correct and explain certain
00:06:15 details, so all three things to do
00:06:20 the ones he is dedicating to me
00:06:23 on pause of course and it has been a pretty strong moral blow to
00:06:31 go from having what
00:06:34 I was going through to the case
00:06:37 without counting sleeping at home in my
00:06:40 apartment I spent almost
00:06:44 nothing 20% ​​of the time we are
00:06:47 out almost all the time  outside always
00:06:50 outside
00:06:52 and now
00:06:56 and a lot a lot of time for your stops
00:06:59 to be instructive to reflect
00:07:03 to think to
00:07:06 work in the future try to
00:07:08 mate to learn something
00:07:12 god and continence continue to work
00:07:14 personally composition evaluating what
00:07:17 I have but it is not the same
00:07:22 and I want you to me  Explain a little about the
00:07:24 situation in Panama, how is it, James, this
00:07:27 situation is very bad in Panama.
00:07:31 Fortunately, Panama has the
00:07:34 fortune of  which has a
00:07:37 key logistical position for the continent
00:07:41 there is no shortage of supplies there is
00:07:44 no shortage of medical tools
00:07:49 nor is there a shortage of human resources
00:07:53 for masters responding very well to the
00:07:56 pandemic what has failed is another
00:07:59 factor that
00:08:02 I want to try to analyze as  as
00:08:05 sober as possible people
00:08:09 are unprincipled as a community and
00:08:15 not by and lead
00:08:20 slow the effort put into
00:08:22 the world
00:08:24 people want to get out early
00:08:26 people are
00:08:29 skirting the law for their own benefit
00:08:32 in the form of
00:08:35 there is a curfew if you use
00:08:38 the word  also touch excel you have
00:08:41 to return home at a certain time
00:08:44 not only that but to control a little
00:08:47 more in panama we call it
00:08:50 cédula that is the
00:08:54 personal identification number like evils of your
00:08:57 personal identification decision card
00:09:04 to
00:09:07 with the last  document number you have
00:09:12 one hour before and one hour after to
00:09:15 leave for example if I if my number is
00:09:18 my ce  lular at 38 and 18 39 22 71
00:09:23 ended in one so I have to leave
00:09:26 at my house at noon and I have to be
00:09:28 at my house for the two valuable ones and it's
00:09:32 a bit special curfew in case
00:09:34 by slots by time slots and  in
00:09:38 those two hours you have to do everything
00:09:40 go to the supermarket what they have to
00:09:43 do between our migrations
00:09:46 you can work you can go to an office
00:09:47 to work
00:09:49 yes yes yes yes yes within my job
00:09:52 I can the curfew not apply the
00:09:56 curfew apply to  people
00:09:58 who are not on a list of
00:10:00 jobs that can be done are fine,
00:10:02 then the jobs are only
00:10:04 really necessary things that can be nothing
00:10:06 affirmative and for now that all is being
00:10:08 reestablished, only the
00:10:10 basic food, medical centers and
00:10:15 pharmacies, little by little it is being  trying
00:10:19 to reopen
00:10:23 sorry reopen to the public
00:10:27 ok so you have that 2 hours a day in
00:10:30 addition to the work things it is
00:10:33 necessary it must be very very very curious and it
00:10:35 happened in panama at the beginning  principle they were
00:10:38 giving women three days three days
00:10:41 to men and one day when no one went out
00:10:44 it went
00:10:47 viral that men went to the supermarket
00:10:49 with lists and that they were doing the
00:10:52 wrong shopping
00:10:58 social analysis tells me what is wrong
00:11:02 with  Peso told him that when the men
00:11:06 were outside, the number
00:11:09 of traffic accidents was higher, the number of
00:11:11 assaults was higher, that is, there are
00:11:15 many red numbers, so the network
00:11:18 changed to that only men
00:11:21 go out one day, they will be able to be in the
00:11:22 rest of the  days
00:11:25 yes us
00:11:28 what situation else because they asked for
00:11:36 it no no there are no complaints they
00:11:38 asked for it it's serious for me for me it's a little
00:11:40 funny
00:11:43 how women know how to carry that part in
00:11:46 panama much better and in a more
00:11:53 more harmonious way more fluid calmer  really
00:11:58 so I understand the measure I don't
00:12:00 agree but I understand the measure so
00:12:02 now the cases of coronavirus are going down
00:12:06 or how is it now now they
00:12:08 are
00:12:10 I have seen today but  or if they
00:12:13 reported yesterday that
00:12:16 the problem is being controlled enough, the problem is giving in to
00:12:20 public pressure to want to continue when
00:12:23 in fact
00:12:25 what worries us or what worries
00:12:28 me the most
00:12:29 is what is known as the second wave
00:12:33 second third or that it is seeing that it is not
00:12:37 you can call me a little
00:12:42 wow
00:12:44 I don't know what word could define my
00:12:46 way of thinking currently
00:12:49 but within itself this is true that
00:12:52 this is some form of war
00:12:54 or non-war conflict because there are no weapons but if it
00:12:57 is some kind of conflict it is true
00:13:00 within  of the strategies that have been
00:13:03 repeated in this century, which is a first
00:13:05 attack, waiting for the defenses to come out and
00:13:08 a stronger attack, I know that this is
00:13:12 war, but if it is,
00:13:17 what we are going to have to deal with in the
00:13:20 second half of the year
00:13:23 depends  of our decisions within
00:13:26 the next two months until June
00:13:27 even
00:13:32 but I know who has given that it is going to
00:13:34 collapse us but that it is
00:13:38 not going to change us as much as society is going to change us
00:13:44 and how  how is it affecting your family your
00:13:48 parents your parents are in thailand they do not
00:13:51 work in thailand
00:13:53 and they are relatively well
00:13:58 the truth has been
00:14:01 quite a tedious job since they have had
00:14:04 to assist people
00:14:06 who have been stranded in
00:14:08 thailand clarion and being repatriated to their
00:14:11 country the embassy of spain has also
00:14:14 done a lot of work trying to
00:14:16 find planes to find flights to
00:14:19 return people to spain and such the
00:14:21 embassy of turkey has done a
00:14:23 great job against kirchner ways they
00:14:26 are not paying me  I am not doing
00:14:27 advertising but I have seen that they did a
00:14:31 great job to distribute to their family
00:14:34 because they already had many flights because they already
00:14:37 have many flights between Europe and Asia
00:14:40 let's say
00:14:43 affirmative which is good for them exposure
00:14:45 in a very quiet market
00:14:47 but yes my parents too  I greeted
00:14:50 fortune
00:14:51 the rest of my family is in panama
00:14:53 and I talked talked with them talked
00:14:58 with them
00:14:59 Fortunately, no person
00:15:02 that I know of within my
00:15:05 personal circle or my online electronic circle is well,
00:15:11 none has presented, has had
00:15:14 complications regarding
00:15:16 the virus
00:15:19 and well, for now, all the studies that
00:15:22 such, well, Spain is the one that is for  Now
00:15:26 I think it is the second country in the world
00:15:28 with the most with the most affected
00:15:34 if it is insurance it is the most affected
00:15:37 per inhabitant plus people infected
00:15:39 per inhabitant and so it is good one
00:15:43 of the worst countries there is still some
00:15:45 that perhaps it is not
00:15:47 united kingdom russia or united states but
00:15:51 the issue is close to the beginning yes but
00:15:54 now spain good but it surpassed italy today
00:15:58 then in spains and they closed at
00:16:01 first they closed they didn't let you out
00:16:05 unless you went to the supermarket
00:16:07 pharmacy to the bank or to work later
00:16:11 they still closed it  plus you couldn't go to
00:16:13 work unless you had an
00:16:15 essential job that you worked in a hospital
00:16:19 or a supermarket
00:16:21 in transportation  of merchandise and such
00:16:26 but now, well, they have stabilized it,
00:16:29 now the number of new cases is going down a bit,
00:16:32 the hospitals also have a
00:16:36 little more space, they are not so
00:16:38 saturated, so they are starting to
00:16:41 open a little and they are leaving time
00:16:44 every day for a while to  that the children
00:16:47 go out they can leave the house at least
00:16:50 because the children were closed at
00:16:53 home they arrived closed at home for several
00:16:55 weeks
00:16:57 and then and well and adults also
00:17:00 once a day can go out
00:17:02 to exercise or for a walk
00:17:05 and we are seeing that to  see if at what
00:17:08 rate we can return to normality
00:17:11 without the cases rising again
00:17:14 and the hospitals becoming saturated no,
00:17:18 so my family is also like that
00:17:21 I have a friend who had the
00:17:23 coronavirus had it
00:17:25 and had relatively strong symptoms he
00:17:28 was in the  The hospital was
00:17:31 greased
00:17:32 but now he is fine, he did not arrive, they did
00:17:35 not put him on a respirator,
00:17:38 follow him, but it was difficult for him, it was difficult for him to
00:17:40 breathe and so on and now he has
00:17:43 passed it  He has already returned home and he is even
00:17:45 fine
00:17:46 and I am a little worried right
00:17:50 now I am worried about my mother
00:17:52 because my mother works in the hospital
00:17:56 so in the hospital well she could
00:17:58 catch the first line of debate
00:18:01 yesterday more if they have done a couple of  from tests for
00:18:05 the virus and it has come back negative
00:18:08 so for now it's fine also
00:18:10 she is not in direct contact with the
00:18:13 patients she is not a nurse she is not a doctor
00:18:15 so well
00:18:21 but right now a hospital is the
00:18:23 riskiest place you can be in
00:18:27 and unfortunately
00:18:29 and  my father used to work in the
00:18:31 hospital but now he is retired
00:18:36 he is older he is over 65
00:18:38 so he no longer has to work
00:18:42 so he can be at home he can be
00:18:44 relatively isolated and be safe
00:18:48 what happens is that in spain when they
00:18:51 began to take care of the  hospitals
00:18:54 began to overwhelm the government and it was
00:18:57 one thing the government allowed
00:19:01 retired doctors and nurses to
00:19:03 go back to work
00:19:08 because there was so much  hospital staff
00:19:10 who had been infected and could not
00:19:12 continue working so they said we
00:19:15 are short of nurses we are short of doctors
00:19:18 so you can go back to work even if you are
00:19:20 retired it is optional people
00:19:22 could decide whether to go back to work but of
00:19:26 course they are older people they are people who
00:19:28 are at high risk of  die if they catch the
00:19:31 virus I
00:19:35 don't know so it's a somewhat strange decision I don't know if it is the
00:19:37 most appropriate one
00:19:41 well the thing is that in this type of
00:19:45 situation one doesn't know if the right one
00:19:47 until after they
00:19:48 have taken and surely it
00:19:52 is quite risky  but
00:19:58 and
00:20:02 then my mother
00:20:05 [Music]
00:20:09 diners decided to go back to
00:20:13 work to help everything but well I
00:20:17 was worried I said why because
00:20:20 you're going to catch the virus
00:20:22 but for now how are you doing what's
00:20:24 up my father is not a nurse he is not a
00:20:27 doctor  he is hospital administrative staff
00:20:32 and so the day he went to work the
00:20:34 first day and they realized that this
00:20:37 government order is only for  There were
00:20:40 doctors and nurses
00:20:42 so my father couldn't and they sent
00:20:45 him home and we are happy
00:20:52 but it is true that many things that
00:20:55 are happening now until later
00:20:57 we will not know if they were correct or not
00:21:02 but the important thing is to act, react
00:21:06 and synchronize the actions
00:21:09 because  It is of no use to us that half of
00:21:12 us remain locked up and the other half
00:21:14 leave
00:21:15 that and then between countries because what happens
00:21:19 if a country does it very well, detects
00:21:21 all cases, eradicates the virus but
00:21:23 then it continues to enter from other
00:21:25 countries,
00:21:28 we have to be very  good coordination
00:21:30 and ideally learn to learn from
00:21:34 what is happening so that in the future we can
00:21:36 react better react faster
00:21:41 we are left with a choice I don't know
00:21:44 if my children or grandchildren are going to experience this
00:21:48 very likely after my grandchildren
00:21:51 why
00:21:53 would I  they like mathematics
00:21:56 and statistics very much and it is very probable that
00:21:59 this will be repeated in 100 years or 200 it
00:22:01 has been happening during the last  or a
00:22:04 millennium that repeats itself
00:22:07 is a cycle and well, we are not going to
00:22:11 keep history this way and
00:22:17 to see, perhaps, to see what will be
00:22:20 the way in which this affects globally
00:22:23 if this is going to be a beautiful historical
00:22:27 moment, a historical moment that surely
00:22:34 Let's tell our children, our grandchildren, not the boss's stories. I can already imagine today I'm doing it in
00:22:37 a video story in 2020, of course,
00:22:40 that was the last time we
00:22:42 were able to enjoy the open air
00:22:46 and I hope we don't hope we find
00:22:50 a way to deal with them and well
00:22:54 thank you very much
00:22:56 the countries are responding and the
00:22:59 people are responding well I
00:23:01 keep the positive of this situation
00:23:03 which is the affection the warmth of the
00:23:06 people and even my neighbor from time to
00:23:09 time have asked me if  I'm fine
00:23:11 because I live alone as a
00:23:13 foreigner
00:23:15 and
00:23:17 yes, a lot of people really like the
00:23:20 kindness of a lot of people in that
00:23:21 situation.
00:23:26 Now,
00:23:32 like the camera, the camera dissimilarly, taken
00:23:37 as
00:23:39 it would stop, more complicated, I searched for myself,
00:23:43 but if that has been seen,
00:23:46 I'll stick with that and with patience,
00:23:49 patience, and perseverance a little bit of
00:23:52 these two,
00:23:55 we'll go back to where we were, that's what I mean,
00:23:57 well, the new normal.
00:24:01 of course it repeats itself quite well
00:24:06 to see how it will be to see if it will
00:24:08 change us because I recently made a video
00:24:10 about whether it is going to change our culture
00:24:12 our culture of shaking hands or
00:24:14 giving each other two kisses city to look here I
00:24:18 already have a theory about  how it happened
00:24:20 in latin america and in spain in italy i
00:24:22 don't know what other european countries we are
00:24:25 more latin i think romania where
00:24:28 when we greet each other it is with a big hug
00:24:33 kiss hand
00:24:35 we have the letter sometimes and they do it
00:24:39 thank you they are no longer done
00:24:43 in other parts of the world  It is not very
00:24:46 common to see such fraternal greetings
00:24:50 for people who are not families.
00:24:54 The other thing that remains for me and I wanted to
00:24:55 highlight Pablo
00:25:00 is nature. The coma has reduced the
00:25:04 emission of carbon dioxide.  ono and
00:25:06 nature as it has germinated again
00:25:09 germinates our
00:25:12 eyes and it is thanks to our absence and
00:25:15 if that is not a lesson for us
00:25:17 how we should move forward in the future with the
00:25:19 new normal then we are not going to learn and
00:25:23 we are going to continue  repeating the same
00:25:27 I hope we learn that both to deal
00:25:30 with this situation and to preserve the
00:25:33 natural world and all well

00:01:21 cultivated fields for some type of cultivation of
00:01:24 plants that need a lot of water
00:01:28 and we are ready  to arrive  I think we

00:01:38 cross a bridge you don't have to come by
00:01:40 boat so well now I'll show you I
00:01:47 don't know what I see because everything
00:01:50 It's interesting that we'll see, I'll show it. Okay
00:01:53 , we've already reached the entrance to the park.
00:01:56 That stop
00:01:57 this is the entrance.

00:02:13 bike lane here you can go
00:02:15 by bike all over the island and it's a cool ride it
00:02:19 's a pretty pretty ride
00:02:21 and as you can see there are shops to

00:02:37 there's also a market here
00:02:39 I'm not sure but well if we see it
00:02:42 anything that seems like a market to
00:02:46 you that seems interesting p  Well, well,
00:02:48 he showed you for now, let's go, let's go
00:02:51 to the park, I've seen this path here and it's
00:02:55 a very, very beautiful path that's on one
00:02:58 side, there's water, there's like a ditch, there's
00:03:01 also a water channel with plants
00:03:04 that are banana trees, I think they're banana trees.
00:03:08 this and here next door they have these booths they
00:03:11 have good shops and stores like that
00:03:16 I wouldn't say food they are not restaurants like
00:03:19 snacks and such and they have these booths
00:03:22 booths like this made with bamboo
00:03:25 and it seemed to me something very typical we are going to
00:03:28 see this a bit until the end  from the
00:03:30 road all this is the
00:03:35 entrance road to the park we have not
00:03:38 entered the park yet first we are going to
00:03:41 look for something to eat here yes here they do
00:03:44 do some food but many
00:03:46 stalls are closed you see that here it
00:03:49 is closed but hey look this is
00:03:52 very very nice the tables and chairs almost
00:03:55 made with bamboo look look look
00:03:59 how nice and let's see if we find
00:04:02 a place to eat that they give us something to eat
00:04:06 I don't know maybe here
00:04:08 here maybe we can sit  and eat
00:04:11 something in the shade and then we will enter
00:04:14 the park well in the end we have
00:04:17 sat here in one of these these
00:04:19 stores
00:04:21 and I am going to eat like some noodles noodles of
00:04:27 Chinese origin that still have the
00:04:29 Chinese name it is not it does not have the name of
00:04:32 food  thai but they have been made in
00:04:35 many places in thailand for a
00:04:37 long time and we are here next to the
00:04:40 water
00:04:42 what are you eating what are you eating
00:04:45 show us what you are eating are
00:04:49 pork
00:04:54 balls pork fish fish balls fish balls
00:04:59 like surimi no  a bit like Japanese surimi
00:05:02 and we are here well we have
00:05:05 seen it before that they do that noodles
00:05:09 there are very few places open very few
00:05:12 options I guess there is less tourism
00:05:16 than normal and well that is why there are fewer
00:05:20 places and well this is what I  They have
00:05:22 brought are the noodles I have ordered them without a
00:05:25 license because well as I already told you in
00:05:29 another in another video I do not usually eat meat
00:05:32 so I have ordered them without a license and well
00:05:37 only to fill me up a bit for n  or
00:05:39 go hungry later at night
00:05:41 I'll eat something better
00:05:44 and well see you later we'll go
00:05:47 we'll enter the park and we'll see
00:05:49 what the park is like inside and now
00:05:52 we enter the park here you don't have to
00:05:55 pay
00:05:57 so they ask for a mask it's strange a lot of
00:06:00 people  We see that a
00:06:02 lot of people go without a mask like that and
00:06:06 that has not been talked about before. You have seen
00:06:08 how many bugs went there. A lot of
00:06:11 dragonflies are dragonflies that
00:06:14 always fly above the water, but there are a
00:06:17 lot, look, look, look,
00:06:20 what a lot of dragonflies
00:06:22 around  luckily dragonflies don't sting and
00:06:26 luckily dragonflies don't sting like
00:06:28 bees well there's a bit of
00:06:31 shade around here look at the trees these trees
00:06:35 which is a vanian tree i think they are
00:06:38 in india they are also very very famous i
00:06:41 don't know what they are called in  Spanish well
00:06:45 today I brought a few accessories
00:06:48 for the camera
00:06:50 to be able to put it on the bike and such
00:06:54 now when I can I'll show you the bike that
00:06:55 we have rented we have rented a couple
00:06:58 of bikes and beijin  g a couple of bikes hello
00:07:03 where are we going left or right right
00:07:08 we're going to cross a bridge to see if
00:07:13 I can get my legs yes I think so this
00:07:16 bike has no gears it has no gear
00:07:18 change gears
00:07:22 okay yes that's it
00:07:27 and over here yes I think  This is
00:07:31 where I recorded videos the last time
00:07:33 to see if gym jim price comes if another
00:07:39 bridge comes again up up
00:07:42 up
00:07:44 oh
00:07:45 very good and here all the people taking
00:07:49 photos well
00:07:51 we have asked about the market
00:07:55 before they have told us that the market
00:07:57 closes  at 4, that is, it's already
00:08:01 closed, it
00:08:02 's a shame we came a little late
00:08:05 because I thought it would be less sunny, it wouldn't be
00:08:08 so sunny, we weren't going to burn
00:08:10 our heads,
00:08:13 but it's a shame the market
00:08:16 is already closed, but hey  here in the
00:08:20 park they close at 6 so we
00:08:22 still have time to see the park to show you
00:08:25 the park if I have time I'll
00:08:28 try to record a couple more videos I'll
00:08:30 try to record two more videos they have
00:08:33 here panels to show it to the fauna the
00:08:37 fau  na and the flora of the site I just saw
00:08:40 one with the birds with the
00:08:43 different birds that are in the park and
00:08:47 there is a lot of water as you can see here in the
00:08:50 park there are many many ponds
00:08:54 and such
00:08:56 I don't know if there are I suppose there will be
00:08:58 snakes I also suppose that  there will be
00:09:01 snakes let's
00:09:03 see but it's very good it
00:09:06 's cool it's not hot with all the
00:09:09 shade the shade of the trees
00:09:13 well it's very good it's not sunny well now it's
00:09:16 not sunny it's cloudy it's cloudy
00:09:19 so well it's not sunny anyway
00:09:22 but even if it is sunny here it is very
00:09:24 good and it is not very difficult to come from
00:09:27 bangkok technically it is not a bank
00:09:30 this is one of the cities attached to the
00:09:33 bank but you can easily come
00:09:36 we have come in we have come with serious
00:09:39 serious as a government it is good as  a
00:09:43 taxi but that works with a
00:09:44 phone app so there is an observatory and we
00:09:50 go up
00:09:52 to the observatory where we
00:09:55 parked and here we are going to go up to an

00:10:22 record it with my mobile because with  This
00:10:25 camera is going to look very small, very very
00:10:28 small, maybe with the mobile phone it will look a
00:10:31 little better and I'll try to record it and

00:16:52 the park I don't remember the name of
00:16:54 the park but hey it's the park so
00:16:56 it's in Ankara bye it
00:16:59 was a bit dark I'm going to
00:17:01 put them like this I
00:17:04 've  I order this lime lime shake
00:17:11 I don't order many shakes I'm
00:17:13 careful with what I eat and what I drink and
00:17:16 I don't usually ask for things with sugar and such
00:17:18 more than maybe once a week or so
00:17:22 but hey that's how I show you the kind of
00:17:25 things  what do you have here  uí in thailand and
00:17:27 this is that well lime juice lime which
00:17:30 is like a lemon but small round green in color
00:17:34 and ice and sugar i guess well
00:17:38 sugar syrup with water and let's see how it
00:17:42 's ok it's it's it's sweet
00:17:46 what's going on  the lime is very
00:17:48 acid by itself and well it has to be a
00:17:50 little sweet otherwise it would really be very
00:17:53 very acid and babies
00:18:00 spray
00:18:03 this cost me 40 40 bats it is one of the
00:18:08 cheapest things there is except
00:18:12 that there are cheaper sodas
00:18:16 lemon melon soda yes well they have the
00:18:18 sodas they are drinks that they buy
00:18:21 but what they make is the smoothie that they make
00:18:24 themselves this is the cheapest it is like
00:18:26 a euro more or less a euro well right
00:18:29 now the baht is a bit expensive
00:18:32 really  It's a little more a little more than a
00:18:34 euro but good like a euro or a euro
00:18:36 10 a euro 20 or so I don't know if it will be heard
00:18:39 well because the music is very loud the
00:18:43 music
00:18:49 if you don't see how fast the worm moves
00:18:52 a little worm  green we have seen it
00:18:56 going up a link a thread  it was kind of
00:18:58 climbing up a thread like a
00:19:02 spider's thread
00:19:04 and now it's walking up the branch it
00:19:07 seems a bit dark now but it's
00:19:11 still 4 it's 4 in the afternoon
00:19:14 I think it's because it's cloudy it's
00:19:17 cleared again and it seems a bit  dark
00:19:20 but I think I still have a
00:19:23 while to record a video to see
00:19:26 if we find a nice place well
00:19:29 nice everything is nice in this
00:19:31 park but let's see if it finds a
00:19:33 good place well even more beautiful
00:19:37 interesting or that is a bit  It was a
00:19:40 little out of the way so that people don't
00:19:43 bother us when I recorded another other
00:19:47 video you see it here it's a lizard here

00:20:50 sitting on the  bike and if I believe I believe
00:20:53 that
00:20:54 we are not going to leave soon I am going to show you
00:20:57 the bathroom here that is funny he
00:21:00 is funny the sign they have here the
00:21:03 sign that there is a girl and a boy who
00:21:06 are here they want to  to pee they
00:21:08 are peeing and there are the two of them who
00:21:11 are about to pee now we are going to show you
00:21:14 a little about the area here outside the
00:21:17 park the road we take a turn there to the
00:21:21 left we are going to show you a little about
00:21:23 this area so
00:21:26 that no cars come
00:21:29 like  you see it is a narrow road
00:21:34 but it is bidirectional it is in l  The two
00:21:37 directions are
00:21:38 just fine, if cars come from
00:21:41 both directions, you have to be a
00:21:44 little careful
00:21:46 but it's quite good, it's very flat, the
00:21:50 entire bank is really flat,
00:21:52 so it would be the ideal city to go
00:21:56 by bike if it was prepared, if
00:21:59 there were lanes  bike if it were safe and
00:22:01 such
00:22:02 but good as a bank that in itself is not
00:22:06 at least here this area this island
00:22:09 is like that it is quite good for
00:22:13 a bike ride and
00:22:16 we have rented the bike in the
00:22:19 park
00:22:21 but you can rent them too
00:22:24 where the ferry leaves you where the boat leaves you
00:22:26 if you come with the pts with the
00:22:29 skytrain or the elevated train then you
00:22:33 get off the station and you can take a
00:22:35 mototaxi to where the train is the
00:22:39 train doesn't spare the boat
00:22:40 the boat that crosses the  river and the river
00:22:42 brings you here to the island of banca
00:22:44 bye let's see what's coming a car is coming and
00:22:48 well yes there is a bit of traffic as you can see
00:22:50 but hey the cars don't go very
00:22:53 fast so well it's fine you can
00:22:55 h  It's quite a long route if you go
00:22:58 all the way around the island it's quite
00:23:01 long it's a while a long time by bike in
00:23:03 principle now we are going to the market
00:23:06 but I don't know if there will be any shops
00:23:08 open we go because we have time we have a
00:23:10 while before we have to  put it back
00:23:13 on the bike but maybe everything is already
00:23:15 closed well in the end we are not going to the
00:23:19 market where we went last time it
00:23:21 seems that it is a little further where
00:23:24 we went is the floating market well they
00:23:27 call it the floating market but not
00:23:30 really there is a little water  like
00:23:33 canals or ditch next to it as we have
00:23:36 seen before and that's it
00:23:38 this is another other market that we have
00:23:40 found along the way and it is open
00:23:43 so well we have decided to take a
00:23:48 walk around here to see if
00:23:50 we find something something interesting they have
00:23:53 things of  second hand second hand objects

186,"00:00:00 Do you know the giggles, he is famous, he is not very
00:00:05 famous because of the story he told and because of
00:00:09 how much he laughed and today I am going to explain
00:00:14 the story he told but in a way
00:00:17 that you will understand
00:00:22 [Music]
00:00:25 hello, yes, the giggles is perhaps not one
00:00:31 of  the most well-known Spanish people
00:00:34 on the internet and it is therefore a meme and
00:00:38 many memes have been made with him laughing and he
00:00:42 is very famous for a story he told
00:00:45 in a program on the south channel
00:00:48 of Andalusian television, a television
00:00:51 from the southern region of  spain and he died
00:00:54 recently, unfortunately
00:00:57 only a few months ago he died and so
00:01:00 today to commemorate this this person
00:01:04 I want to explain his story the
00:01:08 story he told on television the
00:01:11 story that made him laugh so much that he
00:01:14 already told it but well the way he
00:01:17 he speaks because he does not speak very clearly and he
00:01:20 speaks in Andalusian dialect it can be
00:01:23 a little difficult to understand and today I
00:01:26 am going to explain it to you in a
00:01:29 more understandable way so this is the story
00:01:32 the story of  the paella pans and this is
00:01:37 when he worked or
00:01:42 was working as a
00:01:45 kitchen assistant, not a kitchen assistant, he is the person
00:01:48 who helps the cook who helps the chef
00:01:51 in the kitchen of a restaurant and this
00:01:55 was in a restaurant on the coast a
00:01:57 restaurant on the beach and it was in the
00:02:00 town of chipiona in the province of
00:02:03 cádiz in andalusia so he started
00:02:07 working in this restaurant the first
00:02:10 day of the season the first day
00:02:13 that there was during the year this was a
00:02:16 restaurant that was closed in winter
00:02:18 and then in the spring, summer, and
00:02:22 autumn they opened because many more tourists came to town,
00:02:27 so the chuckles who was the kitchen boy and
00:02:31 the cook were scrubbing
00:02:34 scrubbing everything because of course the
00:02:36 restaurant had been closed for months before being
00:02:40 able to cook before being able to serve, well,
00:02:43 covered plates at  people who
00:02:47 came to eat at the restaurant had to
00:02:49 wash everything and they were washing
00:02:52 since 10 in the morning they started
00:02:55 at 10 in the morning  and they were there
00:02:58 until 2 in the morning until two
00:03:00 at night yes then at two in the
00:03:04 morning
00:03:06 the cook gives the chuckles twenty
00:03:10 paella pans twenty paella pans with monkey
00:03:14 workshops with mushrooms with those with those
00:03:17 green or gray circles of mushrooms and
00:03:21 gives him  20 paella pans the paella pans are the
00:03:23 large pans with which the paella is made
00:03:26 so the cook told him that
00:03:29 to clean them he had to
00:03:32 pass a rope through the hole in
00:03:36 the handle, not the handles
00:03:39 I suppose they usually
00:03:41 have handles on the sides  To
00:03:44 grab the ones, pass a rope through
00:03:47 all the handles and take them all to
00:03:50 the beach, put them in the water on the beach
00:03:54 and the water with the salt
00:03:57 would clean them and they would clean themselves,
00:03:59 so he told her to take the
00:04:02 paella pans to the beach.  and on the beach to
00:04:05 bury them in the sand they would put them in the
00:04:09 sand in the wet sand where there
00:04:11 was still water with the movement of the water
00:04:15 and the sand because they would clean the
00:04:18 paella pans themselves  so yes
00:04:22 then the chuckles did the chuckles he did
00:04:25 that he buried the paella pans and placed
00:04:28 some sticks so it already occurred even he
00:04:32 was ready he realized today here the
00:04:35 paella pans I don't know if I'm going to remember
00:04:39 where I buried them so he put
00:04:42 sticks he put some  sticks in the sand to
00:04:45 mark the place where
00:04:47 the paella pans were buried then he returned
00:04:50 to the restaurant he told her that she
00:04:53 was already buried in the sand and
00:04:56 the cook told her
00:04:59 to go to sleep and
00:05:01 rest because at  I would wake him up at eight in the morning, I
00:05:05 would come to wake him up so
00:05:08 that he could go to the beach to look for the
00:05:11 paella pans, which would now be clean,
00:05:14 so at eight in the morning, well, if he
00:05:17 went and the cook woke him up, he woke
00:05:21 up giggling, come on, come on, kiss the beach
00:05:24 for  the paella pans and the visitors well he went
00:05:27 to the beach he arrived at the beach and
00:05:31 realized there was a problem Maria
00:05:34 the tide had risen
00:05:39 yes yes chipiona is in the atlantic is
00:05:43 in the ocean
00:05:44 so  the tide changes the water level a lot
00:05:47 and at 8 in the morning
00:05:50 the tide had risen
00:05:52 and now all the paella pans well who
00:05:56 knows where it was, she didn't know where they
00:05:59 could be after a while looking for
00:06:02 the paella pans she found one she found a
00:06:06 paella pan the other 19  It is not known where they
00:06:10 ended up, he found one among the rocks,
00:06:13 among the rocks at the Chipiona lighthouse, he
00:06:17 found one and, well, he returned to the
00:06:20 restaurant with a paella pan and he,
00:06:24 the chef, the cook, asked him where
00:06:28 are the other paella pans that we are going to
00:06:31 make with all these kilos of  rice that
00:06:34 we have in Seville we have to go to
00:06:37 Seville uh huh because of paella pans they had to
00:06:40 go to the city to Seville to
00:06:42 buy paella pans they charged the chuckles for
00:06:46 the paella pans he had to pay for the paella pans in
00:06:49 the end he had no money left from the
00:06:52 work he did from  that moment
00:06:55 the giggles never worked in
00:07:00 a restaurant again and since then he does
00:07:03 n't like the beach either and if this is the
00:07:05 story this is the mythical story that's
00:07:08 good  Maybe I didn't know jce just
00:07:11 because most of the giggle memes well
00:07:14 they put some false
00:07:17 subtitles on it, some subtitles in which something
00:07:20 completely different is said but now
00:07:23 you know why he was laughing so much because we
00:07:27 don't know why he was
00:07:29 laughing that way but we know  Why did he
00:07:32 laugh so much when he told this story
00:07:36 I leave you the link to the original video of
00:07:39 him giggling in the video description and

00:04:04 who was the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte,
00:04:08 so at this moment France-Spain
00:04:12 has officially been invaded by
00:04:16 France, but many Spaniards do
00:04:20 not want to be part of France, they are not
00:04:22 happy and they begin to see it
00:04:25 in various places in Spain and the
00:04:28 Spaniards begin to make a revolt
00:04:32 against the French army
00:04:34 then on May 2 on May 2
00:04:39 there the uprisings of May 2 and
00:04:43 the start of the Spanish war of
00:04:46 independence is called the
00:04:49 war of independence to this war
00:04:51 against France for  remain an
00:04:54 independent country napoleon exiled the
00:04:59 kings to france he took the
00:05:02 royal family to france whether he kidnapped them or not
00:05:06 afterwards  Because of this, the French army came
00:05:11 to the Royal Palace of Madrid. They wanted to
00:05:13 take the youngest son of Carlos Cuarto,
00:05:16 the youngest son of Carlos Cuarto, who
00:05:19 is Francisco de Paula. Francisco de Paula
00:05:24 was the last member of the royal house,
00:05:28 the last person in the family.
00:05:31 real
00:05:32 that was in madrid and the people of
00:05:35 madrid resist try to stop it
00:05:38 try to stop them from taking francisco de
00:05:42 paula but they lose they lose and in the end
00:05:45 the french win they manage to take
00:05:49 francisco de paula and as revenge for
00:05:52 their resistance the french army
00:05:56 keep attacking  The people of Madrid continue to
00:05:59 attack Madrid so that the rest of
00:06:03 the Spaniards can see what happens when
00:06:06 someone resists the French army
00:06:09 so during all this time with the
00:06:13 war against Portugal and the places in
00:06:16 Spain where there were French troops because
00:06:20 there was a lot of French army in
00:06:24 Spain we had to feed him we had to
00:06:27 give food to the soldiers
00:06:29 in Spain we had spent two years in which
00:06:33 there were very  bad harvests had
00:06:37 produced very little food so there was
00:06:40 very little food so many
00:06:43 Spaniards well of course they have little food
00:06:45 they don't want to give the little food they
00:06:48 have to the French soldiers and
00:06:51 they also begin to see revolts
00:06:54 in Spain there begins to be a
00:06:58 guerrilla war
00:07:00 So in many areas of Spain, it is
00:07:04 possible to expel the French, it is
00:07:07 possible to make them withdraw, but in
00:07:10 the north of Spain it was more difficult if we did not
00:07:14 manage to
00:07:16 expel them so easily and they managed to maintain
00:07:19 many many positions in the north of the
00:07:23 country, as was this war  of the
00:07:26 guerrillas it was not very clear who
00:07:29 the leaders were, they want who was the
00:07:31 leader of the revolt, whom you had
00:07:34 to pay attention to, they were not very well
00:07:36 coordinated, not all the Spaniards
00:07:40 were against the French,
00:07:43 that is why the afrancesados ​​also existed,
00:07:47 the afrancesados ​​believed in  the vision of
00:07:53 joseph bonaparte believed in the
00:07:56 modern french state believed in the e  elimination
00:08:00 of the absolutist king so the
00:08:04 Frenchified ones were more on the side
00:08:07 of France but they were still Spanish they
00:08:13 tried to mediate a little the interests
00:08:16 of their country of the citizens of their
00:08:20 country with the interests of the
00:08:23 transformation of politics but in the
00:08:26 end they ended up being hated in the end
00:08:30 everyone hates them they go to the afrancesados
00:08:32 the Spanish thought they were
00:08:35 traitors
00:08:37 and the French well they saw them as
00:08:40 Spanish and that's why they didn't like them anymore
00:08:42 no then Napoleon comes
00:08:45 comes Napoleon himself comes to Spain he
00:08:49 comes with 250,000 soldiers 250,000
00:08:54 soldiers with  an army and it comes to
00:08:58 Spain and at this time is when
00:09:02 the famous sieges or sieges take place. It is
00:09:07 another name for sieges.

00:09:28 zaragoza by the french

00:10:09 open the gates and let the
00:10:12 army come in then here Spain loses

00:10:19 Spain defeats the English the
00:10:22 English also us  they were helping in
00:10:24 this war and france also

00:10:37 austrian empire declares
00:10:40 war on napoleon and napoleon has to
00:10:43 go to make war somewhere else and
00:10:46 then  At this moment,
00:10:48 Spain takes advantage and counterattacks the
00:10:52 French army and in 1809 there is an
00:10:58 important battle
00:10:59 Lavalle, the battle of Ocaña Ocaña, which is
00:11:03 it's good near aranjuez near

00:11:11 has more men they have more soldiers
00:11:14 than france but we still lose we
00:11:17 lose the battle and the
00:11:21 iberian peninsula ends split ends divided into

00:11:32 France,
00:11:33 Aragon, Aragon, Navarra and the Basque Country -
00:11:38 France puts them as
00:11:41 independent governments, governments dependent on
00:11:45 France, governments under the command of
00:11:47 France, that France can tell them
00:11:50 what to do
00:11:52 and they are good, they are military governments. In the
00:11:55 end, it is the soldiers who control
00:11:58 these regions and this situation lasted
00:12:02 three years until 1812 and in 1812
00:12:10 the English joined, Portugal joined and
00:12:15 Spain joined the three to fight against the
00:12:19 French and they began to conquer the

00:00:03 television programs programs from Spain' that were
00:00:08 so interesting that they were copied in
00:00:13 other countries abroad
00:00:18 [Music]
00:00:21 Hello, yes, well, I think that Spain is not
00:00:28 very famous for its television programs,
00:00:31 but there have been several,
00:00:35 there have been  A few that have really
00:00:39 been popular and have spread have
00:00:43 been copied in other countries today I am not going to
00:00:47 talk about series I am only going to talk
00:00:50 about television programs
00:00:53 but hey if you like this video in this
00:00:57 format let me know
00:00:58 and I can make a version
00:01:01 about  series
00:01:04 Spanish or Latin American television series of which
00:01:08 international versions have been made
00:01:11 but not today today I am going to talk about
00:01:15 programs and I am going to tell you from the least
00:01:19 popular to the most popular okay
00:01:24 the first is the anthill let's see I'll
00:01:28 put a picture of the anthill
00:01:31 El Hormiguero is a talk show, it
00:01:34 's a late-night program in which
00:01:38 people come to interview
00:01:42 themselves and talk to them and such, but it's a little
00:01:45 different because they h  More things are
00:01:49 done like scientific experiments and
00:01:53 such
00:01:54 and it's a program in which there are two
00:01:57 ants two ants but ants that
00:02:01 talk if you have to watch watch the program
00:02:05 to know what I'm talking about because
00:02:09 this good program is quite popular
00:02:12 and has been replicated  It has been copied in
00:02:16 Portugal, in Chile, in Brazil, and in Mexico
00:02:21 in 44 countries.
00:02:44 I think the original
00:02:47 is a Catalan program called
00:02:50 afers exteriors
00:02:53 from here versions were made in other
00:02:56 communities in Spain and then the
00:03:00 version for all of Spain was made' that the version
00:03:02 for all of Spain is called Spanish in the
00:03:07 world what is this program about  This
00:03:11 good program I am going to talk about foreign afers
00:03:13 the original goes to different countries and they are going
00:03:19 to talk to people people from here
00:03:23 maybe Spanish or Catalan people who
00:03:27 live  in other countries who work there
00:03:30 and they will see what their lives are like, they will see
00:03:34 the country but also the experience of
00:03:37 these people living in that country.
00:03:41 Sometimes they are married or have children with
00:03:44 people from that country and such and they
00:03:47 teach you a little, well  How is it to live in
00:03:50 that country? No,
00:03:52 and this good program, in addition to all
00:03:56 the versions of the Spanish communities,
00:03:58 of the national version,
00:04:02 was copied in nine countries, plus nine
00:04:06 countries, all Latin American countries have
00:04:10 included Brazil, and then, well, other
00:04:13 Spanish-speaking countries, no, and yes.  They have
00:04:17 made 99 international versions, they are
00:04:20 quite a few versions, plus the next one,
00:04:25 well, and up to 22 more, but the
00:04:29 last two are both about music, they are
00:04:32 about music, because there are really
00:04:36 many music programs, not the first one
00:04:40 is your face, your face sounds like that to me.
00:04:44 in this program there are contestants there are
00:04:47 several people who compete they compete to
00:04:51 see who wins and what they have
00:04:54 to do to this in this program to the
00:04:58 people who participate  bread to the people
00:05:01 who compete they assign a
00:05:06 famous singer they tell them to see take a look Julio
00:05:10 Iglesias you have to invite Julio
00:05:14 Iglesias so
00:05:17 they get a famous singer and they have
00:05:20 to imitate him they have to do it anyway they
00:05:23 have to imitate his voice they have to
00:05:27 imitate his  appearance they make up they
00:05:31 cut their hair I don't know if they cut their
00:05:33 hair or put on a wig no maybe
00:05:36 they put on a wig and well they put on make up
00:05:39 and dress well just like the person
00:05:42 even the movements and such when they
00:05:45 dance well they try to imitate
00:05:48 exactly  this person not this artist and this
00:05:51 program has been copied to 48 43 43 countries
00:05:59 it has been imitated it has been copied in 43 other
00:06:03 countries outside of Spain- not then in
00:06:07 this case well
00:06:09 not only Latin American countries
00:06:12 because there are not so many countries in
00:06:14 Latin America  It has also spread
00:06:17 to many European countries and the last one
00:06:20 that has been copied
00:06:22 in even more countries and this is a
00:06:26 program because when it appeared in
00:06:29 Spain it became good  very famous and
00:06:34 singers came from here who later

00:06:54 for several years then they stopped for a
00:06:57 while but then they did it
00:07:00 again and this
00:07:03 this program is a
00:07:06 singing competition program in which the
00:07:12 people who went had to learn to
00:07:15 sing
00:07:17 and they had to do it well they competed and it
00:07:20 was a  mix of competition and
00:07:24 reality show because they competed you
00:07:27 saw them how they sang in their
00:07:30 concerts no but you also saw their

00:01:15 chubby and as a result
00:01:21 of this  that of that state that was
00:01:24 transitory, which means that little by
00:01:26 little I grew up and I stopped
00:01:31 being
00:01:33 a little chubby
00:01:36 and started practicing fencing
00:01:40 fencing fencing is a sport in which it
00:01:45 is an individual sport in which you and

00:02:30 fencing
00:02:32 really to recognize that I liked it a
00:02:37 lot
00:02:38 also for me it was a way to
00:02:44 free myself from not thinking about anything else nothing
00:02:49 about studies  Just concentrate Focus
00:02:53 on doing sports
00:02:56 well Doing it well

00:03:02 bad luck that my teacher
00:03:07 liked
00:03:09 him He thought I was good and he
00:03:17 thought I could forgive a fly a
00:03:22 mosquito sorry he thought long
00:03:25 ago  For a long, long time I was
00:03:28 good and that I could train and practice
00:03:32 to go to
00:03:36 national and international competitions, that is, he

00:03:47 At first, I was a little excited and I
00:03:52 was excited, I was wow, it
00:03:56 was incredible, I don't mean  that they try to
00:03:59 make me a very good
00:04:03 athlete at the beginning I agreed
00:04:07 that is to say I said yes because we are not going to
00:04:10 practice anymore  more and more
00:04:16 so we began to change the
00:04:21 training place and we began to go one
00:04:24 more day a week I speak in the plural
00:04:27 because it was not only me but another
00:04:30 classmate
00:04:33 and we both go and go together because the
00:04:37 teacher thought we were good and
00:04:40 we could achieve we could  compete
00:04:44 internationally well
00:04:47 chan chan
00:04:49 I spent two years
00:04:53 training
00:04:55 quite hard very conscientious
00:04:59 but there
00:05:01 came a time when
00:05:05 going to class going to training going to practice
00:05:12 became a suffering I didn't like
00:05:15 when I started
00:05:18 chubby and 12 years old
00:05:21 for me  It was a liberation and at that
00:05:26 time going to train had
00:05:28 become an obligation and
00:05:33 real suffering. I didn't have a good time.
00:05:35 I didn't like my teammates there. They
00:05:41 were very competitive. I just felt and
00:05:46 perceived and observed competitiveness
00:05:52 and wanting to win, win, win,
00:05:56 and I didn't.  I'm not at all if not I obviously don't like it
00:06:01 like everyone else I
00:06:04 like to win but at that moment I
00:06:09 saw
00:06:12 things that I didn't like  They liked it
00:06:16 so finally,
00:06:22 I think I was back when I was
00:06:24 12 years old and
00:06:28 I didn't start before, sorry I started before when
00:06:31 I was 9 years old and my goodness, who has a bad
00:06:36 memory
00:06:37 [Music]
00:06:39 and I was there until I was 16 because I fencing
00:06:44 for 8 years finally it was the
00:06:48 last two years when I trained  very strong and
00:06:52 with forgiveness and with a view to something more
00:06:56 professional but at that moment I
00:06:59 realized that I was not feeling well, I
00:07:02 was not comfortable and I decided
00:07:06 to decide
00:07:09 to give him fencing.
00:07:12 The truth is that at that moment
00:07:17 I felt very calm because
00:07:22 I no longer saw that competitiveness,
00:07:27 but it is true that many times
00:07:31 since I stopped until now I have thought
00:07:36 many times about doing it again, it
00:07:41 is a sport that I liked, I liked it
00:07:45 very much, very demanding and it requires a
00:07:49 lot of work, that is, you need to
00:07:52 work  a lot a lot
00:07:55 but I was was cool
00:07:59 when we say cool or if ever or is
00:08:02 why it means that I was very very well
00:08:07 and good in relation to my experience with
00:08:11 fencing and the  competitiveness that I
00:08:15 observed and that I personally did not
00:08:19 like
00:08:21 more than anything because I am the complete
00:08:25 opposite
00:08:27 I can help you I will do it and I
00:08:31 saw that the people there did not help each other
00:08:36 therefore I did not like it therefore
00:08:39 I gave up
00:08:41 but I would like  throw the ball into
00:08:45 your roof as they say here in
00:08:47 Spain what does it mean to
00:08:51 give you the opportunity now
00:08:55 to speak or act and in relation to
00:08:59 this experience that I am telling you that I
00:09:03 am telling you I would like to know if
00:09:08 at any time you have
00:09:11 practiced  some curious or somewhat unusual sport
00:09:17 because fencing is not a
00:09:21 sport that everyone practices,
00:09:23 such as soccer or even in
00:09:27 soccer if you have played soccer and if
00:09:31 you have felt or observed this
00:09:35 competitiveness that I am talking about here today as
00:09:40 well  I would like to know what
00:09:44 you think of that competitiveness. It
00:09:47 is true that to dedicate yourself
00:09:51 professionally
00:09:55 to a sport you have to have a
00:09:59 lot of interest.  restlessness
00:10:03 [Music]
00:10:04 you must
00:10:07 want to be the best you really have
00:10:10 to want to be the best
00:10:13 and for that very reason because I want to be the
00:10:15 best
00:10:17 I don't have to help other people and
00:10:20 be very very very very competitive and not
00:10:23 look at those who are next to me  around
00:10:24 only me I I I I or do you think there is
00:10:28 another type
00:10:31 of healthy competitiveness
00:10:34 in which I can help
00:10:39 and not not perceive and not feel like I did, for
00:10:44 example, I don't know, maybe it's
00:10:48 my thing and it's my point of perception
00:10:52 It's like my point of view, like how I
00:10:55 see and feel things, but I would
00:10:59 like if you have any experience to
00:11:02 tell it and if you also want to give your opinion,
00:11:16 why not?  I have to
00:11:18 start moving a little more now
00:11:24 well, nothing boys and girls
00:11:26 see you soon see you later

119,"00:00:02 [Music]
00:00:05 hello good ones here I am again and
00:00:10 today I want to talk to you about something that makes
00:00:14 the language that you are
00:00:17 learning Spanish very special and that is that in
00:00:22 Spanish we use two
00:00:26 question marks
00:00:29 and two exclamation marks
00:00:34 when in the rest of the languages ​​we only use
00:00:37 one is used at the end then
00:00:40 because in the Spanish language we use
00:00:44 two well it must be said that if the
00:00:50 Spanish language is the only language in which it is
00:00:54 obligatory to put the two symbols if the one at
00:00:59 the beginning and the one at the end of the cinema
00:01:01 both  signs
00:01:05 there are people who sometimes do it in the
00:01:08 Galician language, which is a language
00:01:11 spoken in Galicia, a region in western
00:01:13 Spain, but it is not mandatory,
00:01:17 so Spanish is then the only language
00:01:21 in which you have to put two symbols and
00:01:26 because what is the story behind
00:01:30 this
00:01:32 well let's start by saying that the
00:01:38 question mark and exclamation marks
00:01:41 were born many years ago first
00:01:46 the question mark was born if the
00:01:49 i symbol  question that is the one we
00:01:51 use in the questions
00:01:54 that was born with the Carolingians the
00:01:57 Carolingians were French kings
00:02:02 and well as I said it was only used at the
00:02:05 end of the sentence
00:02:07 and well in Spanish in the Hispanic world
00:02:11 we have something called the real the
00:02:15 Spanish academy  what is an institution
00:02:19 if an organization that
00:02:24 what
00:02:27 public
00:02:30 writings publishes books volumes
00:02:34 saying how we should speak and write
00:02:37 the Spanish language
00:02:39 if these books and dictionaries collect
00:02:42 how we Spanish speakers speak and
00:02:47 also recommend how we should
00:02:50 speak or write then at first
00:02:55 the royal Spanish academy to the  At the time of
00:02:59 publishing dictionaries and spelling books they
00:03:02 only mentioned the symbol at
00:03:07 the end
00:03:10 but later
00:03:15 I think that in the year 1700 1700 something I am going to
00:03:21 look at it exactly in the year 1754 they
00:03:26 said that you also had to write
00:03:29 a symbol at the beginning of the sentence
00:03:32 because
00:03:34 because there were very long sentences and if there was
00:03:39 no symbol at the beginning, the person
00:03:42 who  When I read these sentences I was not going to know what
00:03:46 intonation and how to read these
00:03:51 sentences properly because if you don't see the
00:03:54 question symbol at the end you don't know
00:03:57 how to modulate the voice so they thought
00:04:02 well if we have long sentences
00:04:06 we are going to also use a sign at
00:04:09 the beginning
00:04:10 and  This also applied to
00:04:16 exclamatory phrases if the exclamation mark
00:04:20 is the one that goes in phrases
00:04:25 that express an emotion that expresses
00:04:28 fear or sadness, but since this sign
00:04:32 appeared much later or somewhat later, the
00:04:36 question mark was used to
00:04:38 ask questions and to express  an
00:04:40 emotion then as I say the royal
00:04:45 Spanish academy said well if we have
00:04:48 long sentences we use a symbol at the
00:04:53 beginning also yes but what happened of
00:04:57 course people did not know exactly what
00:05:01 was a long sentence and what was a
00:05:03 short sentence so about 100 years later
00:05:11 the real one  Spanish academy said that it
00:05:16 would be necessary to put the
00:05:20 question mark at the beginning of the sentence
00:05:23 always yes
00:05:26 and well I will be born later  to the
00:05:29 exclamation mark the exclamation mark yes
00:05:32 it is also put at the beginning in
00:05:34 Spanish
00:05:37 and well that is the
00:05:41 reason as I say in others it is the main
00:05:47 reason is that the reader
00:05:51 at that time knew how to read a
00:05:54 sentence from the beginning yes  because
00:05:57 also in the Spanish language
00:05:59 an affirmative sentence a sentence a
00:06:03 normal statement and a question does not
00:06:08 differ grammatically it is not
00:06:10 like English or German where we
00:06:14 reverse the subject and the verb yes this happens
00:06:18 in many languages
00:06:20 but not in Spanish like this  which was a
00:06:22 way of differentiating the only way to
00:06:25 differentiate a question from a
00:06:27 normal sentence is the intonation if we modulate
00:06:31 the voice
00:06:33 and if we can't know until the end
00:06:35 of reading a sentence then we are going to have
00:06:38 problems so that's why the real one
00:06:41 Spanish academy made this decision and
00:06:44 well the truth is that nowadays many
00:06:47 people do not write the opening signs
00:06:52 and to open the exclamatory
00:06:56 and interrogative sentences
00:06:58 well there are even p  Spanish teachers
00:07:01 who do not write them and well,
00:07:06 I think that as Spanish teachers
00:07:10 we should always write them and
00:07:13 whenever we are
00:07:16 writing formally, of course, when I
00:07:18 talk to my friends, I don't
00:07:21 always write the signs, it is clear, but I think
00:07:24 that as teachers of  Spanish,
00:07:26 we should always write these
00:07:29 signs because it is something that makes our
00:07:32 language unique, so it is something that we
00:07:35 should not lose and I think that we
00:07:37 are losing it little by little due to the
00:07:39 influence of other languages ​​and also
00:07:42 for convenience, yes, because nowadays
00:07:45 with  the mobile
00:07:49 because it is more difficult to write the
00:07:52 question marks and exclamation marks at the
00:07:54 beginning but well that is my opinion and
00:07:58 I hope you have found
00:08:01 this story interesting and tell me if you
00:08:06 always put these marks or if
00:08:09 sometimes you forget that is all a greeting
00:08:13 oh
00:08:15 oh
00:08:17 oh

198,"00:00:00 hello in this video we are going to talk about
00:00:04 slavery in spain but
00:00:09 slavery existed in spain if you want to know the
00:00:13 answer stay and watch the video
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:22 a slave is a person who has no
00:00:27 rights or freedom is a person who
00:00:33 belongs to another is  property of another
00:00:37 person a slave can be sold and can
00:00:41 be bought as a commodity and
00:00:45 throughout history
00:00:48 slavery in spain or in the
00:00:52 iberian peninsula has been a common practice
00:00:58 in different peoples different peoples
00:01:02 that have occupied the iberian peninsula
00:01:06 during the empire  Roman
00:01:11 slavery was a common practice
00:01:14 also in the Iberian Peninsula' for
00:01:18 the Romans the slaves were the property
00:01:23 of their masters and the slaves
00:01:28 had no right or
00:01:32 freedom when a slave had a
00:01:35 child the slave's child was the property of his
00:01:40 owner but at this time although the
00:01:43 slaves did not have freedoms and did not
00:01:47 have rights, there were some
00:01:51 laws
00:01:53 and they protected the slaves  Those who
00:01:57 forbade masters to slave owners
00:02:02 hurt or kill their own slaves
00:02:07 or someone else's slave little by
00:02:12 little Christianity
00:02:17 Christianity became the religion of the empire
00:02:21 and
00:02:23 then the slaves began to see themselves
00:02:27 as human beings  They were considered
00:02:31 servile humans which, well,
00:02:35 simply means that according to this vision,
00:02:40 slaves were people who were
00:02:45 born to serve after the fall
00:02:49 of the Roman Empire with the Visigothic kingdom.
00:02:55 The slave system became much more
00:03:00 complex. There were many different types of slaves.
00:03:07 slaves were children of
00:03:10 other slaves but others were
00:03:15 people who had been
00:03:18 captured in wars or people who
00:03:24 had been sentenced to slavery
00:03:28 for having a debt or even people
00:03:33 who sold themselves as slaves
00:03:37 there were also domestic slaves who
00:03:42 worked in the houses  who served in
00:03:46 the households and farm slaves who
00:03:50 served on the plantations
00:03:54 normally  e domestic slaves
00:03:57 were better treated and some even
00:04:02 got freedom at that time
00:04:06 the king's slaves and could even
00:04:11 have land and have their own
00:04:15 slaves too after the
00:04:18 visigoths the
00:04:21 muslims the muslims settled
00:04:26 in the iberian peninsula or in a large part
00:04:30 of  the iberian peninsula' in al-andalus
00:04:35 which was the muslim area of ​​the
00:04:40 iberian peninsula' in al-andalus there were
00:04:43 several slave markets
00:04:47 many of the slaves in these markets
00:04:51 were christians who had been
00:04:55 captured in wars against the
00:04:59 christians of the peninsula and of  other
00:05:03 parts of europe but there were also
00:05:07 kidnapped slaves
00:05:10 and
00:05:10 some parts of eastern europe and
00:05:15 africa muslims had a preference
00:05:20 for light-skinned and
00:05:25 light-eyed
00:05:26 slaves had a preference for
00:05:31 eastern european slaves in fact the word
00:05:35 slave comes from slavic  the slavs are
00:05:40 the people from
00:05:44 eastern europe some female slaves who
00:05:49 served in the  harems could
00:05:53 become concubines of their owners
00:05:58 some of them could even get married they
00:06:02 could become wives of their
00:06:06 owners the only ones were slaves men
00:06:11 who had been houses 2
00:06:15 they guarded the harems
00:06:19 and these men could have a
00:06:22 lot of influence they could get  to have a
00:06:25 lot of power in al-Andalus there were also
00:06:29 black slaves
00:06:32 specially dedicated to the guard
00:06:36 during this time in the
00:06:41 Christian kingdoms that still remained in the
00:06:44 north of the Iberian peninsula' in the
00:06:48 Christian kingdoms
00:06:49 it was still allowed to
00:06:54 have Christian slaves but later
00:06:58 This was prohibited and the slaves
00:07:03 became
00:07:05 Muslims,
00:07:08 kidnapped in the wars against Al-
00:07:12 Andalus during the reconquest, when
00:07:16 the Christians
00:07:17 began to
00:07:19 reconquer the Iberian Peninsula,
00:07:23 most of the slaves
00:07:26 came from the Canary Islands and the
00:07:32 idea of ​​Africa in
00:07:36 1492 with the  discovery of america
00:07:43 and revives interest in having slaves
00:07:48 Because for the European powers it is
00:07:54 necessary to have many slaves to
00:07:58 exploit the new colonies but at that
00:08:02 time
00:08:03 Spain and Portugal signed a
00:08:08 treaty that prohibited the transport of
00:08:12 slaves from Africa to the
00:08:16 American colonies to the colonies in America On the
00:08:20 other hand the government  Spanish did
00:08:23 allow the sale of black slaves from
00:08:28 other European colonies to the
00:08:32 Spanish colonies in the Spanish colonies there
00:08:36 were not as many slaves as in the
00:08:40 colonies of other European powers
00:08:44 but in the Spanish colonies there was a
00:08:49 labor system by which
00:08:55 Native Americans were forced  to work for the
00:09:00 colonists they forced the indigenous people to
00:09:03 work for the Spanish colonists in
00:09:07 exchange for
00:09:10 protection and in exchange for a
00:09:14 Christian education these people were not
00:09:17 exactly slaves but they were
00:09:21 not free people they were not free citizens
00:09:26 over time some religious people
00:09:30 complained about the treatment of  these indigenous people and in
00:09:35 the end this labor system was
00:09:38 prohibited  In the 18th century,
00:09:42 Spain signed a treaty with England
00:09:46 where Spain ceded the trade in
00:09:50 black slaves to other
00:09:55 European powers,
00:09:56 but in Spain there continued to be
00:10:00 slaves until
00:10:04 1,766 in this year, all Muslim slaves
00:10:10 in the Iberian Peninsula
00:10:13 were expropriated from their  owned and
00:10:17 sold to the sultan of morocco
00:10:22 some of these slaves were
00:10:25 freed in the 19th century in the 19th century
00:10:32 slavery was abolished
00:10:34 in the peninsula in mainland spain
00:10:39 but in some colonies such as cuba and
00:10:43 puerto rico
00:10:45 there continued to be slaves until the
00:10:49 end of the century a  end of the 19th century
00:10:53 the slaves of cuba and puerto rico
00:10:57 were freed when the
00:11:01 spanish empire lost its last colonies cuba
00:11:05 puerto rico and the philippines in
00:11:11 1898 slavery in spain no longer
00:11:17 existed now fortunately
00:11:21 slavery is just a memory of
00:11:25 but what do you think  Do you think that
00:11:29 slavery is a thing of the past or that it
00:11:33 still has repercussions in the present,

162,"00:00:00 welcome to another video about the
00:00:03 history of spain' today i am going to talk
00:00:07 about what happened in spain from the
00:00:11 year 1500 after the catholic kings
00:00:16 if you remember
00:00:18 in video number 6 i told you about the
00:00:22 catholic kings then i am going to talk to you
00:00:35 I told you about what happened during the Golden Age, I told you about the Spanish Empire's colonies in America, and today I'm going to talk about
00:00:39 what happened.
00:00:42 Today I'm going to talk about what happened in
00:00:45 Spain and what happened.  what happened in europe during
00:00:48 the same time
00:00:52 [Music]
00:00:55 ah well
00:00:57 let's remember that isabel the first
00:01:02 isabel the first was queen of castile she was
00:01:06 the queen in the kingdom of castile and
00:01:09 ferdinand the second ferdinand the second was the
00:01:13 king of the kingdom of aragon
00:01:16 and together they were the  catholic kings
00:01:19 then in 1504 in 1504 isabel dies
00:01:27 isabel died and then ferdinand
00:01:31 also wanted castilla he wanted to stay
00:01:34 with castilla but in castilla there was a
00:01:38 gast government castilla had its own
00:01:41 government and the government the courts the
00:01:45 courts  It's from Castile They didn't choose
00:01:48 Fernando Segundo as king They didn't
00:01:51 choose Isabel's daughter First they chose
00:01:55 Juana Juana Primera and here
00:02:00 something interesting is happening here something strange
00:02:05 1506 they say it's beginning to be said that
00:02:10 Juana Primera has gone crazy or
00:02:13 is going crazy  crazy then at that
00:02:15 time
00:02:18 the husband Juana's first husband was Felipe
00:02:20 Felipe was Felipe from Habsburg if Felipe
00:02:25 was part of the Habsburgs or the
00:02:28 Habsburgs the Habsburgs were a family
00:02:31 of European royalty then when
00:02:35 Juana starts to go crazy or it is said that
00:02:38 she starts to go crazy felipe
00:02:41 becomes the king he becomes king of
00:02:44 castile or well he gets power if
00:02:47 he acts as king instead of juana what happens
00:02:51 that same year in 1506 felipe dies
00:02:56 felipe dies if in a
00:03:01 very suspicious situation that you  It makes one think that
00:03:04 perhaps Felipe died of poisoning, perhaps they
00:03:08 poisoned him, they put some poison in
00:03:11 his food or drink and he died,
00:03:14 perhaps it is not, it is not very clear, he was
00:03:17 only 28 years old.  young man he was very young he
00:03:21 was only 28 years old he became very sick
00:03:25 now he is very sick very quickly and in a
00:03:28 few days in just a few days he already
00:03:32 died so it is believed that it is possible
00:03:35 that fernando fernando segundo
00:03:38 poisoned him so here fernando
00:03:43 fernando segundo and so  seizes the power
00:03:46 of castile becomes the ruler of
00:03:50 castile
00:03:51 in 1500 thousand 509 fernando locks up
00:03:58 juana he takes juana and locks her
00:04:02 up he locks her up because because he says she is
00:04:04 crazy and from this time from this time
00:04:09 until now first juana is
00:04:12 called  Juana la Loca is also known
00:04:16 as Juana la Loca, but today there is still a
00:04:20 doubt as to whether perhaps she wasn't
00:04:24 crazy and it was all a plan by Fernando Segundo
00:04:28 because Fernando had been told
00:04:32 no that he couldn't stay with Castilla and
00:04:35 maybe  fernando began to think well
00:04:38 he got angry and began to think about how
00:04:41 I can get castilla so juana
00:04:45 juana had a son yes carlos first
00:04:48 carlos first yes he has he has 444
00:04:53 hairs yes  I had three, maybe you
00:04:56 would think it's Carlitos, but it's not
00:04:58 Carlitos, it's Carlos, Carlos the first, but
00:05:02 at this moment,
00:05:04 Carlos, the first, he was only six years old, he
00:05:08 was six years old, he was a child, a
00:05:11 small child, so
00:05:13 while Carlos wasn't growing up, they made
00:05:17 Fernando the Regent.  they gave him power
00:05:21 he wasn't technically he wasn't king but he
00:05:24 played king while juana
00:05:27 couldn't govern and carlos first was
00:05:30 too small to govern
00:05:34 so if fernando fernando went to
00:05:37 fight wars in italy he conquered
00:05:40 parts of italy he conquered navarra the
00:05:44 kingdom of navarra  he conquered it and Navarra
00:05:48 became part of the kingdom of Aragon
00:05:51 Ferdinand also fought he fought against the
00:05:55 French he fought against France that was
00:05:58 something normal most of the
00:06:01 Spanish kings fought against France
00:06:04 the French for example also
00:06:07 wanted Navarre they wanted to get
00:06:08 Navarra but Ferdinand won
00:06:12 in  1000
00:06:14 thousand 516 in thousand 516 fernando dies and
00:06:21 fernando dies and carlos pr  Imero
00:06:25 becomes the king then Carlos first
00:06:28 becomes the king of all Spain' of
00:06:31 Castile and Aragon as well as Holland of
00:06:34 Belgium of Naples of the Kingdom of Naples
00:06:37 and other areas of Italy of the Americas
00:06:41 he was also the king of much much place
00:06:44 many  parts of the world and carlos the first
00:06:48 became king he was crowned at
00:06:51 only 16 years old with 16 years of age
00:06:56 then well felipe felipe and carlos
00:06:59 were the beginning of
00:07:03 the austrian dynasty in spain and a few years
00:07:07 later carlos the first also inherited
00:07:10 parts of  germany what is called the
00:07:14 holy roman germanic empire that would be
00:07:18 a very important empire
00:07:21 in europe for many years
00:07:23 so what happens that here
00:07:27 john the first was still alive she
00:07:29 was not dead yet but carlos first
00:07:33 keeps her locked up keeps her locked up she
00:07:35 doesn't get to be the queen  so in the
00:07:40 center of europe in this holy
00:07:43 roman empire is where in price
00:07:46 where the reformation began the
00:07:49 protestant reformation where lu began  Theranism was
00:07:52 not part of the church, the Catholic Church
00:07:57 did not agree with some things, they
00:08:00 wanted to change some things and they
00:08:03 separated from Catholicism, so there were
00:08:07 problems between different parts
00:08:10 of Germany, the Catholics, the
00:08:12 Protestants, and Carlos first, because he
00:08:15 was involved in those wars,
00:08:19 then to fight wars  In Germany,
00:08:23 well, just like Fernando
00:08:25 Segundo, look for them. They continued to fight with the
00:08:28 French, so something important,
00:08:32 and in 1555, the peace of Augsburg was signed.
00:08:39 This peace is a peace between
00:08:43 Catholics and Protestants. It was signed for
00:08:47 religious freedom in Germany.
00:08:51 From then on, you could legally be  of
00:08:54 any religion he wanted and in
00:09:00 1556 carlos the first haptically abdicates he
00:09:05 decides that he will no longer be the king he
00:09:08 will not be the king anymore carlos the first he
00:09:11 was not very happy he was not very
00:09:13 happy with what he had achieved in
00:09:16 his life he had not achieved  unify
00:09:19 europe had failed to create a single
00:09:23 European empire had failed to
00:09:26 prevent the pro  testantism and prevent the
00:09:31 success of the iv of the
00:09:34 protestant religion then carlos first
00:09:38 retires
00:09:39 he goes to the country to live quietly
00:09:41 but he dies soon after
00:09:44 too carlos first dies so
00:09:48 then comes the son the son of carlos
00:09:50 first who was felipe second  Carlos the
00:09:54 first gives him the Spanish empire, that is,
00:09:57 Spain and the Americas, he gives them to his
00:10:01 son Felipe Segundo, but the Holy
00:10:05 Roman Empire, the properties
00:10:09 of Spain or King Carlos the First, in
00:10:13 Germany, in the center of Europe,
00:10:15 gives them to his brother.  brother of carlos
00:10:18 first then from then on they
00:10:22 separate they separate because central
00:10:26 europe the kingdoms of central europe
00:10:28 with everything that is the spanish empire
00:10:31 then felipe what did felipe do well of
00:10:35 course he fought with france a little
00:10:37 more at this time  portugal portugal and
00:10:42 spain- united they
00:10:44 were 60 years for 60 years
00:10:48 spain and portugal were united
00:10:52 so at this time spain still
00:10:56 had holan  The Netherlands and Belgium were still
00:10:58 part of Spain and there were wars there
00:11:02 and Spain was not doing
00:11:04 very well the war in the Netherlands was not doing very well
00:11:06 then England the United Kingdom-
00:11:09 having good at this time the Netherlands
00:11:13 Holland included the Netherlands and part of
00:11:16 Belgium  England supported the
00:11:20 resistance to the resistance in the Netherlands
00:11:23 that was fighting against the Spanish and
00:11:27 Spain and England were also
00:11:31 fighting over the Caribbean for control of
00:11:34 the Caribbean islands in Central
00:11:37 America so King Philip
00:11:40 decided to attack England.
00:11:44 attacking england
00:11:46 they did not want to invade england but they
00:11:49 wanted to remove the queen at that moment there
00:11:53 was isabel the first isabel the first was
00:11:57 the queen of england and felipe the second
00:12:01 wanted to remove her he wanted to remove her as
00:12:03 queen but failed from spain they were
00:12:07 ships they were a lot of ships to
00:12:11 attack they were  130 130 ships but in
00:12:17 this battle half and half
00:12:22 ended up broken ended up destroyed
00:12:26 only half came back no and 20.  000
00:12:29 people 20,000 men 20,000 men
00:12:32 died in this in this battle
00:12:35 so during all these years
00:12:38 all these wars the way Spain
00:12:42 founded its wars the way it got
00:12:44 money for its wars was with gold and
00:12:47 silver that it brought from the
00:12:51 Americas
00:12:52 then 1,598  1,598 Felipe the second dies Felipe the
00:13:00 second dies and
00:13:03 Felipe the third comes his son Felipe the third
00:13:08 was not very interested in politics he
00:13:10 was not very interested in the war to
00:13:13 conquer other countries so when
00:13:16 Felipe the third was king he left the
00:13:20 important things the war the  government and such
00:13:24 he left it to other people to people
00:13:27 he considered to be good at it
00:13:31 during his reign when felipe the third
00:13:35 was king well of course there was a
00:13:39 bit of fighting with france the war
00:13:42 in holland continued and then in 1621 comes as
00:13:48 you may have guessed  Felipe Cuarto
00:13:52 were not very original, they
00:13:54 did not think much to give names to
00:13:57 their children, so in 1618 it had already
00:14:03 begun  The 30 Years'
00:14:07 War The 30 Years' War was a very
00:14:10 big war, a very important war between
00:14:13 Catholics and Protestants, well, it was
00:14:16 done in many places in Europe,
00:14:19 so initially they were Catholics against
00:14:23 Protestants, but of course,
00:14:26 the interests of the  many other
00:14:29 countries many countries joined each
00:14:32 country because it had its own interests
00:14:34 that were not always related
00:14:38 to religion so during these
00:14:41 wars during all these wars
00:14:44 spain from time to time ran out of
00:14:47 you without money they were even sometimes they
00:14:50 were winning and then  they ran out of
00:14:53 money they did not have enough money to
00:14:55 pay their soldiers and therefore they could not
00:14:59 continue attacking
00:15:00 or they did not win the battle because they did not
00:15:04 have enough money in 1936 1600 thousand
00:15:09 636 spain was attacking france
00:15:14 from the netherlands from the netherlands downwards it
00:15:17 was attacking  france and it was going
00:15:19 very well they were doing very well they
00:15:21 were gaining territory but
00:15:25 this happened they ran out of money so
00:15:28 over the next few years france
00:15:31 took advantage france organized themselves better
00:15:34 attacked holland spanish the
00:15:38 rebels in holland also attacked
00:15:40 spain and spain lost many battles
00:15:44 then during the 40's the 1640's
00:15:49 when spain was very busy
00:15:52 fighting  Against the French, it happened that
00:15:55 the Catalans, the Portuguese and the
00:15:59 Neapolitans
00:16:01 in Italy, which was still part of
00:16:04 Spain, well they rebelled, they rebelled
00:16:07 against the King of Spain.
00:16:09 So, in 1648, Spain already lost the
00:16:14 Netherlands and lost Portugal and
00:16:18 Portugal also separated from  spain
00:16:21 but recovers catalonia recovers catalonia again
00:16:24 and recovers naples in
00:16:28 italy also then in 1665 felipe
00:16:34 cuarto was sad he was quite
00:16:37 sad because first his son
00:16:41 had died a son had died a
00:16:44 very very young son very small and he saw
00:16:46 as much of  His empire in Europe
00:16:50 disappeared, it ceased to be Spanish and in
00:16:54 1665 Felipe Cuarto died
00:16:59 then.  The only child he had was
00:17:04 Carlos Segundo Carlos Segundo Carlos
00:17:07 Segundo had problems It is not very
00:17:10 clear how many mental problems he had
00:17:13 if he was a bit stupid or not but he had
00:17:17 physical problems he was infertile he could not
00:17:20 have children
00:17:22 and well it is said that his problems were the
00:17:25 fault of  all the mixtures of cousins
00:17:30 marrying cousins ​​that had
00:17:33 passed in his family in previous generations
00:17:35 so when felipe
00:17:39 fourth died carlos second was three years old
00:17:43 yes then the queen was his mother
00:17:47 for a while his mother became the
00:17:50 queen it was mariana mariana  from Austria
00:17:54 Mariana from Austria and when Carlos
00:17:58 Segundo was older
00:18:01 he became the king, what happens that Carlos
00:18:05 Segundo knew that he was not going to be able to
00:18:08 make a good king, so he looked for
00:18:12 people who would do their job
00:18:14 well, their job well  that they will organize
00:18:18 the country well then this time the time of
00:18:22 Carlos Segundo
00:18:24 was quite peaceful there was relatively
00:18:27 quite a lot of peace and it was a was a time
00:18:31 In which the economy improved, the Spanish economy
00:18:34 improved a lot and the standard of living
00:18:36 of the Spaniards also improved.
00:18:40 Then, in 1700, Carlos Segundo died
00:18:46 as he was infertile because he had no children, and of
00:18:50 course, whenever a king dies without
00:18:53 children, this generates a  problem and in
00:18:57 this case a war but
00:19:01 I'll talk about this war in the next video if

00:00:04 o la andrea such a town how are you
00:00:08 very well today we are going to play a game
00:00:13 that I have already played before and he has made
00:00:18 videos / migue spanish playing this
00:00:21 game but today we can both play
00:00:24 together
00:00:27 so normally when we play
00:00:31 we have a competition  but today is not going to
00:00:35 be a competition okay thanks
00:00:39 today we are going to play together
00:00:43 let's go well I'm going to show you how it
00:00:45 works for those of you who don't know it is
00:00:50 going to show us a view of a place in the
00:00:52 world look here it's 360 degrees
00:00:58 and we have to  Guess where in which country in
00:01:01 the world it is okay
00:01:04 then we're going to write to write down the
00:01:09 country we think of and then we're going to see if
00:01:12 either of us have accepted it
00:01:14 if you or I have been right okay though
00:01:18 ok
00:01:19 then I'm going to show you I'm good
00:01:23 take a look around and I'm going to look at
00:01:25 things that seem interesting to me
00:01:30 and see if any of them catch your attention
00:01:33 here it seems that there is something written in
00:01:36 some language I don't sing well from a
00:01:39 track
00:01:45 you can
00:01:48 [Laughter
00:01:52 ] see if you can find  I'll give you a little more clarity,
00:01:56 well, here more in this language, well, I
00:02:00 'm going to write what I think,
00:02:04 too, well, come on, we
00:02:07 can say where we think it
00:02:11 's good, it's clear, no, you've been in
00:02:13 this country, I think, yes, yes, I recognize it.
00:02:19 where is it in my opinion it is brazil if not
00:02:23 i think it has to be brazil because
00:02:26 well it is portuguese it is written in
00:02:28 portuguese and it seemed to me like spanish but
00:02:32 with faith with cedilla and accents and such is the
00:02:36 cover and then so many plants both
00:02:39 green and such surely  it is not portugal
00:02:42 and it is brazil true
00:02:46 the streets are very brazilian if it
00:02:50 is also fixed several times and it
00:02:53 seems a country with less good with less
00:02:57 less rich not very well what then
00:03:00 andrea dare to say what city
00:03:05 of that where is it in brazil
00:03:09 a bit the difference between the north of
00:03:12 brazil and the south the different plants and
00:03:15 such that there are yes yes yes I know
00:03:20 real estate businesses enter this beautiful and I
00:03:23 think it can't be river I think it's not the
00:03:27 river I suppose  or what is it like in sao paulo
00:03:29 I think that
00:03:32 well let's see let's see the
00:03:35 solution I have no idea I have
00:03:38 n't been our without fear of but well
00:03:44 let's select come let's
00:03:46 spin sao paulo
00:03:47 here don't
00:03:48 come 1 2 3
00:03:56 well he
00:03:58 loves  a lot in manaus yes but but
00:04:03 good that we have hit the country we have
00:04:05 a point okay
00:04:08 well it will be rather to the north not everything is
00:04:11 possible in this life
00:04:13 well very good very good come let's
00:04:16 see the next one
00:04:23 okay we have here a river not
00:04:29 a bridge a bridge  over the river the
00:04:32 yellow lines on the street that
00:04:35 this also give clues in some
00:04:36 countries they are white in others yellow
00:04:41 yes later also the buildings are they
00:04:46 may be different sometimes the cars
00:04:49 no also yes they are also different let's
00:04:52 see if we see something written that  It puts
00:04:55 here I am a bit it is arriving that if I
00:04:57 don't see but if I don't either someone
00:05:00 certainly has to put this type of
00:05:02 signs ok that also the
00:05:06 traffic signs can be different it is not
00:05:08 true where the road leads  person on the
00:05:12 left side of the clear clear clear this
00:05:15 is also a track they drive on the
00:05:17 right side of the country ok and the person
00:05:20 behind the wheel of the
00:05:24 car well normal if driving on the right side they
00:05:26 are on the left side of the car
00:05:27 as it would be  in the logo in mexico it's
00:05:32 worth to see if we see something else
00:05:36 and the word mountains yes we have
00:05:40 mountains here and no snow I don't
00:05:43 think it's the sun that shines here
00:05:48 yes but it does look like a place I don't know I don't
00:05:51 know if it is  a place where it will snow in
00:05:52 winter I'm not sure but they do not
00:05:55 have trees no maybe they are
00:05:57 high mountains
00:06:01 and here I know I don't know if there is any other clue
00:06:06 here it seems like a restaurant or
00:06:08 cafeteria
00:06:11 true
00:06:12 good I'm not sure but I'm going to
00:06:17 risk it  Ok, do
00:06:20 you have any idea? I have
00:06:23 two ideas, but I don't know which one to choose, which one do you
00:06:27 think is in which continent do you think it's in?
00:06:42 said  the other thing
00:06:44 but although I say that I want to think
00:06:50 maybe I'm super bad but I want to think
00:06:52 that Argentina
00:06:56 Argentina could be me It's never been
00:06:59 to Argentina and it could easily be
00:07:02 me Of course it could be that it's in
00:07:05 Argentina no matter not the signs well they
00:07:07 're like  The ones in Europe but I think that in
00:07:10 Latin America you also use the
00:07:13 same ones, not that in Europe,
00:07:15 here is a train crossing, these
00:07:17 signs of a train crossing,
00:07:20 ok, Europe has not appeared to me, but it
00:07:26 could be, it could be Argentina.
00:07:29 It seems that it reads something and I don't know if it
00:07:32 says the yeti or something like that, it can't be and
00:07:36 pray I don't know so I'm going to say
00:07:38 Italia world I know ok so if we have
00:07:42 two well two very different options
00:07:45 maybe a bit to the north of Italy there's
00:07:47 more  mountains
00:07:49 you have been in italy yes i have been in
00:07:52 italy yes but not for good yes i crossed
00:07:55 from france to italy in a bus that
00:08:01 goes through areas like this with many bridges and
00:08:03 such
00:08:04 ok ok you have a very good point but i
00:08:08 don't know let's go  Let's see here on the map,
00:08:10 well, in the same frame, I mark whatever and
00:08:13 then if one of us accepts it,
00:08:15 we already count as what
00:08:17 we have guessed right, okay, not the Marqués de
00:08:20 Argentina merchant 1 Italy,
00:08:25 I'm going to put a little I don't know why  here let's
00:08:31 see
00:08:34 wow
00:08:40 go and you wanted to mark argentina
00:08:44 I told you
00:08:47 so it was close near italy but they
00:08:50 were in switzerland well what a shame we didn't get it
00:08:53 right but very close very close
00:08:56 it moves very close only 118 kilometers
00:09:00 wow and the mountain is  very good by the way there
00:09:03 are 55 sites okay ok we have an email
00:09:09 let's go 2 this is the third but one and a
00:09:12 half points to pure they are worth 11 they
00:09:18 were close so let's see where
00:09:23 we are here it
00:09:26 is very clear although english written
00:09:36 we come around well it is very  Of course
00:09:44 I don't know if we can get closer we can
00:09:47 find out the city or something let's see what else is
00:09:50 around here iphone ads
00:09:53 if everything is written in English no if the
00:09:57 people although
00:10:00 yes
00:10:01 I don't know where they are from on the track to
00:10:04 find out the city
00:10:09 here nothing  me and me if there weren't the
00:10:14 name of kenya i would see
00:10:16 louis' entertainment as it is yes yes yes it gives you a
00:10:20 clue because there are countries that seem
00:10:22 similar but for example to
00:10:25 central america in some places in
00:10:27 central america in africa or southeast
00:10:30 asia  you can see the roads and the
00:10:33 plants and such are very similar and with
00:10:36 the people you can tell if it's
00:10:38 Central America if it's Africa like that it's
00:10:40 Southeast Asia
00:10:44 and here the car wash
00:10:49 is a show of flowers and plants an
00:10:52 exhibition of flowers and plants
00:10:55 and  it's like summer i guess that hot
00:10:59 in kenya i'm not sure what the
00:11:02 seasons are if it's always hot and they
00:11:03 have dry and rainy season or how it
00:11:06 works well this maybe this is the
00:11:09 biggest track no tv center mombasa
00:11:13 mombasa road tica road
00:11:17 good  we can see let's see what we found
00:11:19 similar similar to this
00:11:22 gemio
00:11:24 nairobi
00:11:28 has been to kenya no i have never been i have
00:11:33 been to africa i have only been to
00:11:35 morocco and i have not gone down it has not gone anymore
00:11:38 below the sahara below the sahara
00:11:40 i would like to believe it is located
00:11:43 look at mombasa what we have seen here
00:11:47 soccer road are uncertain
00:11:49 is true uh huh and the bomb road
00:11:52 where is it in mombasa or is it in
00:11:54 nairobi going to mombasa
00:11:57 good point not
00:12:00 good  point we can put here ok
00:12:06 because then haiti katica road also
00:12:07 itches up to here itches the last one a road bazaar well
00:12:10 I think it will be
00:12:12 here on the waterway yes and where there
00:12:14 are more people where
00:12:18 nairobi well it is very obvious because it is  the
00:12:20 capital but here there is the
00:12:23 ethics highway on the mombasa highway and it
00:12:25 seems that from nairobi they are going to both
00:12:28 themes we are going to pass well we are going to
00:12:31 be very noble
00:12:41 well yes well the country was very clear with that
00:12:43 no ue no but you  It is very fenced
00:12:47 4 km very well
00:12:51 come to mind
00:12:53 there are two more here the plants are very
00:12:57 different
00:13:00 and what do we see here Andreas what is this
00:13:03 white finally coming if snow is
00:13:09 taking us to different places from where
00:13:11 I have  We've been before, not true, true, but
00:13:14 it's not very good, a little bit of snow, yes, here you
00:13:19 can see it,
00:13:23 then we see these cars like this, quite
00:13:27 big,
00:13:31 one of graffiti,
00:13:35 I don't know if you read something, something well,
00:13:40 you can't read anything, it's not
00:13:42 all alone, here
00:13:46 it is  written in some language is
00:13:51 like languages
00:13:53 [Music]
00:13:55 and here more mountains more snow no or what
00:13:59 then they don't speak in English there I mean
00:14:01 yes maybe yes but their language
00:14:04 is not Russian I'm not going to
00:14:07 tell you that  the the solution but well I
00:14:09 have already chosen a country tell me if you want to
00:14:12 see something something else somewhere else if
00:14:15 I show you the lyrics you
00:14:18 can only make each deposit this is the
00:14:20 maximum
00:14:22 ok ok ok ok well I think if you have one
00:14:28 I think that yes, it's a very good idea, well,
00:14:33 I chose Russia, so I didn't want to
00:14:37 say anything, right, which one did you
00:14:40 choose? Yes, I think it's Russia because of
00:14:43 the letters. I told you it's like, yes, and
00:14:46 I also chose Russia, yes.
00:14:49 but hey, I don't know, I don't know how to read Russian,
00:14:52 but what  e says there in red with white
00:14:55 below the blue letters
00:14:58 here yeah that's how I know what you
00:15:07 copy it photocopies basically
00:15:11 like this if I know the letters then
00:15:16 I guess but it will be like xerox in
00:15:19 English
00:15:23 what happens I don't know Russian so this
00:15:27 alphabet is  It is also used in other languages ​​It is
00:15:30 not used in Ukraine Ukraina in Ukraine Sorry It
00:15:35 is used in Bulgaria
00:15:39 Kazakhstan for example but of course Russian
00:15:44 Russia is a very large country so it is
00:15:46 very likely that this is already Russia
00:15:50 Well yes I think we have proof
00:15:53 Probabilities of having hit  The
00:15:56 truth is that it seems quite lost in
00:15:57 the mountains and they have to but well I
00:16:01 don't know I don't know if it could be on the outskirts
00:16:03 of Moscow tsja of mountains around here let's see
00:16:07 where there are mountains
00:16:08 here there are mountains if the place looks very lonely
00:16:12 but you can  that you can see the
00:16:14 outskirts of a city, yes, but you, you
00:16:18 think that on the outskirts of a city there
00:16:20 would be a photocopies the the issue is that
00:16:24 this map the map we are making
00:16:26 is the urban map of let's say  cities
00:16:31 yes surely it will not be out there
00:16:32 lost in a small town and although it is
00:16:37 good to see that style like this
00:16:39 small town no but but well I
00:16:41 would try here I would try in woods
00:16:43 because the name sounds familiar to me it is basically
00:16:45 ok no because they have not given you more  I could
00:16:49 try to read but I don't
00:16:51 read very well either and I don't read very fast
00:16:53 so it may take me a while here
00:16:57 to find the name of the city
00:17:00 well let's try I think Russia
00:17:01 yes yes we are going to get it right it wasn't
00:17:05 Russia they
00:17:07 were Kyrgyzstan
00:17:16 and maybe  It could be that what you are
00:17:19 doing is Russian because there are many
00:17:21 countries from the former Soviet Union that
00:17:23 write in Russian or maybe not maybe their
00:17:26 language maybe the one that I don't remember
00:17:29 as we call it in Spanish
00:17:33 but it's so cool well it's not so  bad
00:17:37 but it was difficult for them to see yes
00:17:41 but from argentina to kenya yes there was a
00:17:46 lot of difference now not now
00:17:49 the same area of ​​the planet if i
00:17:53 had never thought of kyrgyzstan i would have
00:17:55 thought of russia or kazakhstan but yes of course
00:17:58 Here I would not know the difference between
00:18:01 Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Uzbekistan well
00:18:05 well we have hit 2 2 out of 4 and let's see if
00:18:11 we accept the last one and at least
00:18:13 get a pass
00:18:22 although many will put a lot of yes
00:18:26 let's see now let's see what
00:18:29 we find let's see
00:18:32 well  I don't know if you start to understand
00:18:35 any word around here
00:18:40 chimney
00:18:42 so well it's a language we
00:18:45 know well the style of the
00:18:50 buildings
00:18:52 I don't know the width of the sidewalks and such the
00:18:59 garbage system is worth oysters I know very well
00:19:02 where it is surely it is
00:19:06 worth  see if we can find some clue
00:19:08 for you yes please is that the
00:19:11 red building with bricks with over there you have
00:19:16 buildings like that in mexico no never no well
00:19:20 that's a clue i know it's not in mexico
00:19:23 that yes i know ok you see something a bank something
00:19:28 that catches your attention
00:19:33 here that there is a hairdresser hairdresser
00:19:37 street the name of the street that this sounds like to you
00:19:44 oh oh oh oh well we can tell you
00:19:47 that this is a country where they speak
00:19:48 Spanish yes true to peluq  uería and such
00:19:51 but this word is different no it doesn't
00:19:54 seem to be from Spanish
00:19:56 the attitude doesn't sound familiar to you you already know where it is
00:20:00 and is sure where it is going at least
00:20:02 the region of spain where it is today sorry
00:20:04 you have already said it is in spain but it
00:20:06 is nothing  I no longer know that it is in Spain because of
00:20:09 the buildings because I know that those
00:20:10 buildings are in Spain but
00:20:12 where in Spain it is worth it, well, it is
00:20:17 not that the name of the city
00:20:19 or region has
00:20:22 not appeared. Do you dare to say where I do not know?  If
00:20:24 you know a little bit about the stores in Spain,
00:20:27 ok, look, I'm going to show you here to see
00:20:29 if it's clearer for you, here it says that it says
00:20:32 fraction rest, no, but here are other
00:20:34 words, ok, ok, it
00:20:40 sounds like where could it be?
00:20:44 I didn't make the trip to Spain, that is,
00:20:47 when  school because of photographs I have not
00:20:49 made a flight in Spain I could not travel
00:20:51 to Spain but for this we have been very
00:20:54 lucky that this site comes out, which is
00:20:56 something very educational ok well
00:20:59 yes here it is written in another language
00:21:02 but a language that does not look like anything
00:21:04 to Spanish
00:21:06 what id  Iomas is Portuguese but not like this, not
00:21:10 before you, at dawn, Portuguese has been identified,
00:21:12 you know how Portuguese is like that
00:21:14 and that's why I say it's not your ticket,
00:21:17 according to me, in Spain I could speak
00:21:19 Spanish as Portuguese, but I didn't know a
00:21:22 third language, we have Catalan, Galician
00:21:25 here but Catalan and Galician
00:21:27 also the words are similar to
00:21:30 Spanish and here they are totally different do
00:21:34 you know that language I speak if I do
00:21:37 n't speak it no I don't speak it
00:21:39 but when we see it with the houses and
00:21:43 such well we already know what Spanish is
00:21:45 the spanish
00:21:46 the mexican china in fact you really
00:21:50 remember marce that you recorded a
00:21:52 video game without joining him leave his last
00:21:55 name is carvajalino goenaga and goenaga
00:21:58 is a last name from this region too ok
00:22:03 don't you know it's once not to love each other he didn't tell me
00:22:07 he was from another place
00:22:10 because maybe it would be his maternal grandfather or
00:22:13 something distant yes yes yes but
00:22:18 this is basque basque or euskera ok they
00:22:24 speak it in the basque country where
00:22:26 exactly good
00:22:28 bilbao is like the city  It
00:22:30 could be that because Navarra
00:22:34 is also historically an area of
00:22:38 what was considered the Basque Country, it could
00:22:40 be that things like that, signs on the streets and
00:22:43 such were also written in
00:22:45 Basque in Navarre, but surely this is going to
00:22:49 be in the country  basque the most
00:22:52 important cities are bilbao vitoria and san
00:22:56 sebastián and well we can't choose
00:22:58 bilbao but i don't really know i don't know in which
00:23:01 cities i
00:23:05 don't know
00:23:09 my closest don't make up pablo i could
00:23:12 have searched for the name of the street i
00:23:14 would have to look for the street of everything  eyes
00:23:18 and for aguirre to iparaguirre that we have
00:23:21 seen how many meters meters away
00:23:25 94
00:23:30 for us Spaniards well yes we
00:23:34 have more or less seen a bit of
00:23:36 written Basque and we know how to identify it true
00:23:40 and so yes a point in your favor but
00:23:43 how good you were  from my team and not
00:23:45 against me the jump so we have

136,"00:00:00 Hi, I'm alma, I'm Spanish from Granada,
00:00:05 a city in the south of Spain, and in this
00:00:09 video I want to tell you about my experience
00:00:12 as a fish in the United Kingdom
00:00:17 [Music]
00:00:19 Oh,
00:00:21 and I finished university in 2010
00:00:25 many years ago and when I finish
00:00:29 university in Spain, I won't  there was a lot of
00:00:33 work for young people it was quite
00:00:36 difficult to get a good job here
00:00:39 in spain
00:00:40 so i decided to go to the united kingdom-
00:00:43 and spend a season working in
00:00:46 opera
00:00:48 an opera is a girl normally it's
00:00:52 a girl there aren't many boys who
00:00:55 dedicate themselves or work as  open
00:01:00 then normally it is a girl who
00:01:02 works in helping a family to
00:01:08 take care of the children to take care of the house
00:01:11 is a foreign girl who moves to
00:01:15 another country to live with a family and
00:01:19 not only work for them but also
00:01:23 take the opportunity to  discovering
00:01:27 a different culture to learn a
00:01:30 language is like a cultural exchange
00:01:33 so i searched the internet and
00:01:37 found a very good family in
00:01:40 london
00:01:42 but it is  His family was not a
00:01:45 British family they were Americans it was an
00:01:49 American family from the USA
00:01:54 and well it was a very good family it was
00:01:58 a young couple a young couple who
00:02:01 had two girls had two little girls
00:02:06 the eldest the oldest girl was only
00:02:09 two years old and the  little girl, she was a baby,
00:02:13 a four-month-old baby when I arrived
00:02:16 in London
00:02:19 and they also had a dog, the
00:02:22 family lived with the four of them with a puppy,
00:02:26 so I arrived in London and I was
00:02:28 super happy to be there and little by
00:02:33 little I got used to the  life in
00:02:37 london to life in another country and the
00:02:41 truth is that i was very happy i
00:02:43 was not very happy to be there and the
00:02:46 family treated me very well they had
00:02:50 a very big house they lived in a
00:02:52 very nice area of ​​london and they had a
00:02:55 huge house  So my room was at
00:03:00 the top on the top floor
00:03:03 of the house and I had a very
00:03:07 big room and I had my own bathroom
00:03:10 so even though I didn't have my own
00:03:14 house when it's  I was in London I had a
00:03:16 lot of space for myself I was very
00:03:19 private so a
00:03:22 few weeks went by and I was
00:03:26 getting used to being with the family
00:03:29 normally I was with the mother
00:03:32 with the two girls the father worked in
00:03:36 a bank and had to travel all the
00:03:40 time  he traveled a lot all over the
00:03:43 world
00:03:45 in fact we hardly ever saw him
00:03:49 he was almost never at home so
00:03:53 normally it was only the mother and
00:03:56 the girls and I the mother was a housewife
00:04:01 so I didn't have to spend a lot of
00:04:04 time alone with the girls  normally the
00:04:07 mother was always there with me
00:04:10 taking care of the girls I only had
00:04:13 to stay alone with the girls when
00:04:16 the mother went running in the park or
00:04:20 went horseback riding or I think she did
00:04:24 a photography course too then
00:04:27 when she was doing this
00:04:29 photography course I also stayed with
00:04:31 the girls but in reality it was not
00:04:36 difficult because well we lived near
00:04:40 a park and I could take the girls out  girls
00:04:43 to the park we could play at home there was a
00:04:47 lot of space to
00:04:49 play and to do different things at
00:04:52 home but well I really didn't have
00:04:56 to spend a lot of time with the girls
00:04:58 since the mother didn't work outside the home
00:05:02 I had a lot of free time I had
00:05:06 on weekends  week off but
00:05:10 also Mondays and Fridays many times I
00:05:13 also had them off because the
00:05:16 older girl went to day care and the little girl
00:05:20 the baby stayed with her mother
00:05:23 obviously the mother liked to spend a
00:05:27 lot of time with the baby because he was very
00:05:29 small  so those days many times
00:05:33 monday and friday i was also free
00:05:37 so
00:05:39 since i had so much free time during
00:05:42 the first weeks in london i was able to
00:05:45 do an english course and i did a
00:05:49 six week english course but i didn't
00:05:53 do it in a school near me  house
00:05:56 near the house where I lived with the
00:05:59 family no this is not a school it was on the
00:06:02 other side of the city so
00:06:07 then I had to take the subway
00:06:09 every  s days and cross the city
00:06:13 so I learned to get around the
00:06:15 subway I learned to use the
00:06:18 transport card and well I didn't mind it didn't
00:06:23 bother me having to make a
00:06:26 very long journey from home to school
00:06:29 for me it was fine plus I liked the
00:06:35 London Underground because I had never
00:06:38 seen so many different people because
00:06:41 London is a very
00:06:44 multicultural city and I had never lived
00:06:47 such a multicultural experience and I
00:06:50 liked to go on the tube, it was no problem
00:06:54 for me and also in the English course
00:06:57 I met  a lot of people and I made a
00:07:01 lot of friends
00:07:03 in my class there were people from
00:07:08 Latin America there were a lot of Colombians
00:07:11 there were some Asians
00:07:15 and yes I think they were mostly
00:07:18 Latin Americans I remind you that there were
00:07:22 many many Colombians
00:07:25 so well I spoke Spanish with them
00:07:29 but but I didn't  I had a very good time and I
00:07:33 really liked the experience of the English course.
00:07:36 I didn't learn much English in the
00:07:40 course because my English was already quite good.
00:07:43 Well when I moved to London before I moved to the
00:07:46 UK I already
00:07:49 knew how to speak English quite well
00:07:52 so well in the course I didn't learn
00:07:55 too much maybe some things but
00:08:00 it helped me to meet a lot of people I
00:08:02 got along very well with my teachers
00:08:06 I also really liked my teachers
00:08:09 were very nice and I made a lot of
00:08:14 friends so it was a
00:08:16 pretty positive experience but six weeks
00:08:20 later I finished the English course
00:08:23 and my family my American family
00:08:27 told me that they were going back to the US for
00:08:33 a while.  month throughout the month of november i
00:08:36 don't remember why
00:08:40 they decided to spend that month in the usa
00:08:44 with their family
00:08:47 at home and they asked me if i
00:08:51 wanted to go with them to the usa sms or if i
00:08:56 wanted to stay in the house in london
00:08:58 taking care of the  dog and then well the
00:09:03 mother told me that if I went to the US with
00:09:06 them it might be that I would get bored
00:09:10 that I could get a little bored there at
00:09:13 the family's house because I wasn't going to have
00:09:17 many  distractions I was not going to have
00:09:20 many things to do that is what the
00:09:22 mother told me so I decided to
00:09:25 stay in the house in London taking care
00:09:28 of the dog and they went to the US
00:09:32 all that month
00:09:33 before leaving the mother of the family and
00:09:37 I went to  a supermarket and we bought
00:09:40 everything we needed for a month we bought a
00:09:44 lot of food we bought things for the
00:09:47 house so that I would have enough for the
00:09:50 whole month
00:09:53 and they left they went to the US and
00:09:57 during the whole month of November I had
00:09:59 the house to myself no  I had to
00:10:02 work I didn't have to study I didn't have
00:10:05 to do anything just walk the dog
00:10:08 take care of the dog but nothing else
00:10:13 so that month was an
00:10:15 incredible vacation for me because I had a
00:10:18 lot of time to visit the city I
00:10:21 had time
00:10:23 to see my friends  Sometimes I had parties
00:10:27 at the house and so everything went very
00:10:33 well but in December the family came back
00:10:37 from the US they came back and then
00:10:41 we went back to the usual routine I had
00:10:45 to take care of the  s girls the father was still
00:10:49 working outside but in december in
00:10:53 london it is very cold and it rains a lot the
00:10:58 weather is bad almost every day
00:11:02 so it was a little more difficult to take care
00:11:06 of the girls because sometimes we couldn't
00:11:10 go to the park we couldn't leave the house
00:11:13 we didn't have  nothing to do then it was
00:11:17 a bit boring being home at the end we
00:11:20 just ate chocolate and
00:11:25 watched tv
00:11:27 and it wasn't much fun and sometimes it was a
00:11:31 bit stressful because girls sometimes
00:11:34 cry and well sometimes it wasn't it wasn't
00:11:39 ideal me sometimes  I was stressed a lot I
00:11:43 felt very stressed but well the
00:11:46 family also took me on trips with
00:11:49 them several times the first trip we
00:11:53 did as a family and I went to Tenerife
00:11:57 in February we went on vacation to
00:12:00 Tenerife to the beach and it was great
00:12:03 because I missed  except the sun I
00:12:07 really wanted to see the sun and to go
00:12:10 to the beach so it was a
00:12:13 very good week of vacation also the mother
00:12:17 the girls and I drove from
00:12:21 london has
00:12:25 we went to belgium we crossed the english channel by
00:12:29 ferry and from france we drove
00:12:32 to belgium and the third trip
00:12:36 we took was to croatia they took me
00:12:39 to croatia with them and we were
00:12:42 sailing on a sailboat for a
00:12:46 week and that was amazing because  It was
00:12:49 summer, the weather was very good and I really
00:12:53 liked being on a boat at sea, it
00:12:58 was really, it was really incredible, but
00:13:03 when I had been with the family for almost a year,
00:13:05 they told me that they were going back
00:13:09 to the United States and that they weren't going to spend much more
00:13:14 time in  london they returned home
00:13:18 close to their family close to the grandparents
00:13:22 of the girls so well then I
00:13:27 had to find another job
00:13:31 and that's where my opera experience
00:13:35 in london ended anyway that's all if you want
00:13:39 you can tell me if you've ever had
00:13:42 An experience like this would you like to
00:13:46 be part of a Spanish family
00:13:48 for a while to improve your
00:13:51 Spanish and get to know the culture because something
00:13:55 that does not interest you can tell me in
00:13:59 the comments  ios see you soon
00:14:04 [Music]

100,"00:00:00 Well, since yesterday I showed you my studio, I showed you
00:00:03 how he recorded videos. Today is the
00:00:07 continuation of that video. Today I'm going to show you
00:00:10 how I edit the videos I make
00:00:13 to put together the video from this camera. The
00:00:16 video from the camera above, the sound,
00:00:19 how he put it all together.  To create my videos
00:00:23 like this, if you want to teach your
00:00:26 language,
00:00:27 you can do it, you can do it the same way
00:00:32 [Music]
00:00:35 Hi, so to edit videos I use
00:00:40 Adobe Premiere and Adobe Premiere
00:00:44 is for Mac and Windows
00:00:48 and you do have to pay for this,
00:00:51 you can try it for free.  I don't know if it's a
00:00:54 week I think you can try it for a
00:00:55 week for free but if you want to use it for longer, you
00:00:59 have to pay for it
00:01:02 and I've tried various video editing programs such
00:01:05 as premiere
00:01:07 but the free programs that
00:01:10 I've found none
00:01:14 really worked for me  works well neither couldn't
00:01:16 really use it for what i do it's not
00:01:19 very difficult what i do it's not very
00:01:21 difficult but there are some things i
00:01:24 do know  need no
00:01:27 then I'm going to show you I'm going to make a
00:01:30 new project
00:01:33 and I'm going to use the video of the goat I don't know
00:01:36 if you've seen my video of the goat
00:01:42 and I'm going to make the goat good this
00:01:46 video I already edited it really I already edited it
00:01:48 but hey I'm going to use it as an example
00:01:52 to edit video no so we add
00:01:56 the videos and the audio that I recorded here is
00:01:59 the audio
00:02:01 we are not going to use this we are going to use
00:02:04 this this is going to be the audio imagine
00:02:07 that you have recorded the audio for  separately
00:02:09 if you don't have the audio separately then
00:02:12 nothing happens it's one step less I
00:02:14 have it separately because I use a
00:02:17 voice
00:02:19 recorder I use the voice recorder to record with
00:02:22 better quality and it sounds better than if I
00:02:25 record it with the sound camera then
00:02:27 I have, well, I'm going to put it in premiere,
00:02:31 look, I put it in a separate directory,
00:02:34 I put it in the source directory, that's
00:02:36 how I have it separated,
00:02:40 and I have it here, you'll see that I have a face. Face
00:02:45 is the name I give to the video of my
00:02:47 face and my body.
00:02:51 good p  Remier does an
00:02:53 initial step first but well I think I
00:02:56 can see it and so this is the video in
00:02:58 which I speak no
00:03:03 and then I'm going to close this
00:03:08 and then I have the video of the table the
00:03:10 video of the upper camera
00:03:11 and here you can see  So when I draw,
00:03:19 what do I do with this? Well,
00:03:22 first I take the video from the table and when I
00:03:26 bring it here, when I bring it to the timeline, it
00:03:29 creates a new clip, a new video clip,
00:03:31 no, and this is going to be our clip of
00:03:35 our final click on the video.  the result is
00:03:38 not,
00:03:40 so I also take the video of the
00:03:42 face, I put it here, I put it so that it doesn't
00:03:46 overlap, no, because if I do this,
00:03:50 see if I put it here, it eliminates the
00:03:52 sound track of the other video, I
00:03:54 don't want I don't want that, I want that  everything is kept
00:03:57 separate that everything is that it exists
00:03:59 here and then I also add the sound
00:04:02 so if you use another program that is
00:04:06 not premier it will be a little different
00:04:08 the way it works will be a little
00:04:11 different you have to find
00:04:14 how to do the same as  I this  and
00:04:16 doing, well, you can watch tutorials on
00:04:18 youtube or whatever, but if it's
00:04:21 a program, a somewhat decent
00:04:24 program, a professional or
00:04:26 semi-professional program, you should be able to
00:04:28 do the same things,
00:04:31 so here we already have all the
00:04:34 videos, the two videos and the sound in the
00:04:37 same timeline
00:04:39 what happens that as you see here they are not
00:04:42 synchronized to see how this works
00:04:45 so I think the sound is not synchronized
00:04:49 no some of you see that the same sound is
00:04:52 moved here and here it is moved because
00:04:54 when I start recording well first
00:04:57 I press the button of one  camera then the
00:04:59 other then the sound does not start all at
00:05:01 the same time and you have to synchronize it but
00:05:04 thanks to the sound it will be
00:05:06 easy to synchronize we select it
00:05:09 all and we right click the right mouse button
00:05:12 not the right and
00:05:15 we click  synchronize synchronize you
00:05:19 can do it by different in
00:05:21 different ways but I synchronized it
00:05:23 by the audio with the sound and it already does it
00:05:25 automatically and this is m  It's very simple, I
00:05:27 mean, it makes it much simpler that it's
00:05:30 automatic, otherwise if your program doesn't
00:05:33 have this, you'll have to do the three
00:05:36 claps
00:05:36 one or two or three claps at the beginning
00:05:40 and that way you can do it
00:05:44 manually you can do the
00:05:46 synchronization manually because here
00:05:49 in the video you'll see that  there are three points
00:05:51 three points and then
00:05:53 you can move it by hand not until it
00:05:56 fits until it is in the place you
00:05:57 want
00:05:59 here I already have them synchronized so
00:06:02 here you will see that
00:06:08 the sound already sounds all at the same time
00:06:11 then the sounds this  and I don't need this, I
00:06:15 only want the audio,
00:06:17 well, the audio that I recorded
00:06:19 separately, no, so I deactivate it now, if you
00:06:23 selected the video,
00:06:27 now if you select the video, it
00:06:29 also selects the audio,
00:06:31 if I deactivate this, I can
00:06:34 only select the audio and I make this selection
00:06:36 in the  audio I press delete to delete and
00:06:39 I delete it I delete it and this I put it
00:06:43 I put it here
00:06:44 ok
00:06:46 what happens now
00:06:49 now I like to take everything  do this i like to
00:06:53 take all of this and put it in another clip
00:06:55 put it in another separate sequence
00:06:57 so what i do is this a step
00:07:03 nest nest means nest does not
00:07:06 mean put it in an anesthetic in one in
00:07:10 a clip in a sequence
00:07:12 and separate so if i speak  if I open
00:07:15 this there are the videos that I have put
00:07:17 before so here I can make changes
00:07:21 and the changes will be applied here
00:07:24 everywhere for example I can cut this clip
00:07:28 I cut it here and then if now
00:07:31 I make a change here I make it for example
00:07:33 bigger if I do  bigger and here I
00:07:36 make it smaller
00:07:38 because people can do that no but if
00:07:42 I make a change here
00:07:44 I do it I don't make it transparent I
00:07:48 can make it transparent
00:07:52 then I'm transparent then when
00:07:55 I go to the main video I see that it has been
00:07:57 applied in both places  both in the
00:08:00 first and in the last one the change that
00:08:02 I have made is applied everywhere that's not
00:08:04 why I like it I like to do it like this
00:08:07 because then if there is any change I have
00:08:09 to make a change  bio of the position
00:08:11 of things or the color or the sound it
00:08:15 doesn't matter that I edited the video later
00:08:17 or made cuts or whatever it doesn't matter
00:08:19 because then the same change is applied
00:08:22 everywhere so I like to do
00:08:25 that
00:08:26 the next thing we're going to do  that the face and
00:08:30 the table are in different positions
00:08:33 the face I need it to be in the bottom
00:08:36 right that is in the corner
00:08:39 so I change the scale no and I
00:08:43 changed the position the opposition I can
00:08:45 change the so I put it here
00:08:48 as easy as that
00:08:51 a  The table is a bit more difficult. The
00:08:55 first thing I do is turn it over, it
00:08:57 turns 180 degrees with rotation. I
00:09:01 haven't turned it around because the camera, the
00:09:03 camera I have up here, is
00:09:04 backwards, so I have to turn it
00:09:06 around, but the following  step is a little
00:09:09 more complicated in effects we have videos
00:09:14 video effects
00:09:17 and the effect we want to apply is in
00:09:19 vis tort stand listorti a corner min we
00:09:24 drag this effect to the clip on the
00:09:26 table here on the table worth the face for
00:09:30 Now I hide it, it bothers me, it bothers me
00:09:32 because I can't see this well,
00:09:34 so let's go to the table, select the
00:09:38 control table and here is the effect
00:09:41 that I have put in the corner pink corner pink
00:09:45 now you'll see what happens I'm going to make
00:09:47 this big
00:09:49 you have to select it here  For
00:09:52 example, it's here, well, I have to
00:09:53 select the corner pin and you'll see that here you
00:09:55 can see the corners, you can see the corners
00:09:58 with some blue circles,
00:10:00 I'm going to make it a little smaller. You
00:10:04 see that now the corners are here
00:10:06 in blue, so what do
00:10:10 I do?  It happens if I make it a little bigger
00:10:11 I'm going to try it so it looks better
00:10:14 what I do is take these points and
00:10:16 style them
00:10:17 because well as you can see what I record well
00:10:20 it's all the part where I draw
00:10:23 but also recorded a little more recorded  a
00:10:25 little more to go well carefully so
00:10:28 that it is easier to make it easier to
00:10:29 position the camera well I record a little more
00:10:32 and then here well I stretch it so that it
00:10:34 fits exactly and nothing else can be seen
00:10:37 then I know  Clear so you can see that
00:10:40 down here down there are dots there are dots
00:10:43 that mark the area where he drew
00:10:46 so I style it here also like this
00:10:51 here also
00:10:56 a little more a little more and finally
00:11:00 here
00:11:06 it seems that it's done you can't see the
00:11:08 dots anywhere
00:11:10 I normally go to the end because at the end
00:11:12 is where everything is full of drawings
00:11:15 and I make sure that nothing has been
00:11:18 cut that nothing is cut, no
00:11:20 in this case there are not many drawings in
00:11:22 this video I did not draw much so I
00:11:25 also show you the face  I'm going to show
00:11:27 the face right here the face looks a
00:11:31 little small I'm going to make it a little
00:11:32 bigger so that it covers these points
00:11:34 I'm not going to do it
00:11:41 but it's
00:11:46 okay now it's for the points they
00:11:49 didn't see a bit during the  video that
00:11:51 hasn't moved sometimes the table moves a
00:11:53 bit
00:11:55 and I make sure that everything is
00:11:57 okay, and now I've changed
00:12:00 everything in the nested sequence, but if
00:12:03 we go to the main video, you can see that
00:12:05 the changes and  The changes have been applied here
00:12:07 and they are already here. Okay,
00:12:11 what's next? Okay, well, the
00:12:14 following is good. I have my
00:12:17 introductory video and video at the end, and you, well,
00:12:20 if you do that, you can put it
00:12:22 here, but
00:12:25 initially when you start making
00:12:27 videos  You will not have that you will not have
00:12:30 animations and such so I am going to
00:12:32 teach you how to do it without anything without anything
00:12:35 else only with the video and then we are going
00:12:38 to add photos we are also going to put
00:12:40 several photos so to start then I will
00:12:43 cut the beginning I will cut the beginning
00:12:45 of the video
00:12:47 and I'm going to teach you how to do it with the
00:12:49 cut tool here short and then
00:12:53 with the select all tool
00:12:56 select all to the right this
00:12:59 tool is very useful in premiere
00:13:02 I give it here you see that it is the letter a you
00:13:05 can press the key directly and
00:13:07 you can select everything everything
00:13:09 to the right even if there are cuts
00:13:11 even if there are many cuts or
00:13:13 whatever nothing happens select everything and you
00:13:15 can move everything  all together and doing
00:13:18 so, well, I can delete it
00:13:21 at the beginning of the video that I didn't want,
00:13:25 okay then, what else I do
00:13:29 sometimes is delete the silences when
00:13:32 there is silence during the video, for
00:13:33 example, here
00:13:38 there is silence, no, what I do here
00:13:40 is also  cut
00:13:45 for example cut here and then cut
00:13:47 here
00:13:49 and then with the
00:13:50 select all tool I can't move it like this
00:13:54 and until now I've removed the silence
00:13:59 no
00:14:02 so you can try it in several
00:14:04 ways to see how it looks better for you and
00:14:07 basically well I cut that myself
00:14:09 I already know the keys, not for everyone I can
00:14:11 cut and then here too and move
00:14:16 everything to the left the same okay well
00:14:19 basically I'm doing this I do
00:14:21 everything until the end until the end
00:14:23 of the video at the end of the video well it
00:14:25 also trimmed the end too
00:14:27 If you want, you can simply cut it,
00:14:29 remove a piece, you can also move it
00:14:32 like this, and also remove a piece from the
00:14:35 video,
00:14:37 I'm going to show you how to
00:14:40 put photos and  That's it we'll leave it here
00:14:42 for today so
00:14:45 for example it doesn't matter you can't import
00:14:49 photos you have or images in my case
00:14:53 for example here I have images images
00:14:56 without copyright well he's going to try them
00:14:59 well you're not going to import them but I'm only going to
00:15:01 import one so we can see it as
00:15:03 example, but you can import the entire
00:15:05 directory, the entire folder is also
00:15:08 an option,
00:15:09 well, for example, I'm going to put this
00:15:12 mojica,
00:15:14 I don't know,
00:15:16 four seasons, for example, if you're
00:15:18 talking about the seasons, you can
00:15:21 take the image and put it at the
00:15:23 right time, if in this  Right now I'm
00:15:26 talking about the stations, so I can
00:15:29 put the image of the stations, the
00:15:32 image of the sectionals, the same as before,
00:15:35 you can change, you can't change the
00:15:38 position, put it here, you can change the
00:15:42 size, or here, or here,
00:15:46 you can also change the scale,
00:15:50 and you can do  here zoom and adjust
00:15:54 exactly at what time it starts at
00:15:56 what time the image is shown and at
00:15:59 what time it hides not e  So if
00:16:01 we try to reproduce this here,
00:16:04 you see that
00:16:07 the image appears and now it hasn't taken
00:16:10 a while but I'm going to give it again for
00:16:13 you to see
00:16:15 and it disappears, no, and so you can add
00:16:17 many images and this is the basis to see
00:16:21 in my videos  Basically I do this
00:16:24 sometimes because I put another video in between,
00:16:26 for example, a festival not from Spain' and
00:16:30 then you also do it by cutting, you can
00:16:33 select everything
00:16:35 and move it to the right and then if you have
00:16:37 another video that you want to add here,
00:16:39 just like you added the image
00:16:41 You can add a video
00:16:44 and put it in the length you
00:16:46 want and then here, well, jce fits it again, making
00:16:49 sure that it fits so that there
00:16:52 is no empty space because if there is
00:16:54 empty space, then a
00:16:56 black video will appear, a piece of the black video will remain,
00:16:58 for example, here
00:17:01 that simply  It looks black, so
00:17:03 make sure that there are no
00:17:06 spaces left so that it fits like this, if you see
00:17:09 that the videos don't
00:17:11 stick, they don't stick, you have to activate
00:17:13 here the magnet if the magnet is
00:17:15 blank like this it doesn't work the videos don't hook us
00:17:18 you have to have the magnet
00:17:20 activated and then tics
00:17:24 the videos don't hook and it's easier to work
00:17:27 and that's it basically that's how I make
00:17:30 the videos have you seen a  little how do
00:17:32 I mix the image of my face with the
00:17:35 image of the blackboard the image of the
00:17:37 table and how do I also add the
00:17:39 external sound the sound that I recorded
00:17:41 separately how I synchronized all the
00:17:44 videos so that everything can be heard and
00:17:46 seen at the same time  time and a bit how I
00:17:49 work how I make my work
00:17:52 easier and a little faster by cutting
00:17:54 and moving cutting and moving
00:17:57 and that's it I hope this video helps you
00:18:00 and if you are teachers or if you want to or if
00:18:03 you are not teachers but want to teach
00:18:05 your language to people from other countries
00:18:07 so I ask you to start
00:18:10 making videos too I would like to
00:18:12 have videos like mine but in
00:18:15 many languages ​​okay come see you later

00:00:05 my name is alfonso and in this video
00:00:08 I want to tell you a little about a
00:00:11 very interesting experience that I had
00:00:15 a few months ago in January and February at the
00:00:20 beginning of this year
00:00:24 I was lucky enough to get to know a country
00:00:28 that
00:00:30 had always interested me a lot.
00:00:33 country of which I did not know many things
00:00:39 except for books
00:00:42 and references from other countries.
00:00:46 India
00:00:47 when I told my family and some
00:00:51 of my friends that I wanted to travel to
00:00:54 India, the reactions were diverse.
00:00:58 There were people who told me why
00:01:04 you want to travel to India, it is  A country
00:01:08 with a culture very different from
00:01:10 ours is sure that you will be
00:01:13 able to adapt. They
00:01:15 do not eat beef. Coming from
00:01:20 Argentina, my country was something that many
00:01:25 people told me
00:01:27 , however, I was convinced that
00:01:33 India was going to be a  country that was going to teach me a
00:01:37 lot and that was what happened
00:01:42 to travel to india I had to get a
00:01:46 special visa an electronic visa
00:01:51 I had to scan a recent photo of
00:01:57 myself my passport send  details and
00:02:02 relevant information regarding the
00:02:06 places I was going to visit and
00:02:09 the places I was going to stay
00:02:11 once I got the e-Visa
00:02:13 allowing me to stay in
00:02:17 India for two months I was finally able to
00:02:22 start preparing for the trip
00:02:27 on  trip from buenos aires to the
00:02:32 capital of the state of goa fan so that
00:02:38 was where i started my adventure in india
00:02:40 a very long trip i
00:02:44 had to fly from dos
00:02:47 buenos aires airport
00:02:49 to brazil the city of san pablo and from
00:02:53 san pablo i
00:02:55 had to take another  flight to ethiopia it is
00:02:59 ethiopia
00:03:01 another flight to the city of bombay
00:03:05 and then an internal flight from bombay
00:03:09 to water well as you can see
00:03:13 it was a very long trip
00:03:17 that was also a tiring trip for
00:03:20 me i
00:03:22 spent almost a whole day almost 24 hours
00:03:27 traveling  changing from one plane to another
00:03:33 the truth is that my body felt a
00:03:36 bit strange, I didn't really understand
00:03:39 what was happening to it,
00:03:41 especially because when I went through three
00:03:44 cont  Different times
00:03:46 I went through various time zones the
00:03:51 difference between Argentina and India was 9
00:03:53 hours,
00:03:54 so I initially had those nine
00:03:58 hours difference plus
00:04:02 the trip, the fatigue that was
00:04:04 accumulating between flights
00:04:07 , however when I got water
00:04:11 I went to a small town
00:04:15 called arambol
00:04:18 decided to start enjoying the trip
00:04:22 is that the reason he chose
00:04:25 to start exploring india and not a
00:04:28 big city like mumbai was that he wanted
00:04:32 to gradually enter the culture of the
00:04:36 place instead of entering a big
00:04:40 city ​​where I could experience a
00:04:44 certain culture shock I decided to do it
00:04:48 starting with this small town that a
00:04:52 friend had recommended to me.
00:04:55 The interesting thing about Doha is the fusion of
00:04:59 cultures.
00:05:01 Wow, it was a Portuguese colony in the
00:05:05 past.
00:05:12 Portuguese in
00:05:14 addition to the Portuguese influence in the
00:05:17 region Dutch influence
00:05:21 and also in the past
00:05:23 even the Greeks and the Jews  You arrived
00:05:27 at that place,
00:05:28 obviously the predominant culture is the
00:05:31 culture of the place, the culture of Goa, but it is
00:05:34 a different culture, for example, from that
00:05:38 of North India. In fact, Hindi is not
00:05:40 spoken, which is the most spoken language
00:05:44 in India, but rather a  language
00:05:47 called with cane and obviously English
00:05:51 which is
00:05:53 the common language used by all these
00:05:56 diverse groups to communicate with each
00:05:59 other I have many tourists because it is
00:06:03 one of the most developed
00:06:06 and westernized regions of India
00:06:09 and one of the major attractions is the
00:06:13 coast
00:06:14 the beaches really the
00:06:19 wedding beaches are spectacular the water is very
00:06:23 warm the sand is clear white and they are
00:06:29 vast large huge beaches
00:06:34 many times one can be walking
00:06:37 along the beach and
00:06:39 but a cow is not one of the things
00:06:42 that surprised me the most about the  india for
00:06:47 hindus
00:06:48 oh of course there is a difference between indian
00:06:51 and hindu an indian is a person
00:06:54 originating from india a hindu
00:06:58 refers to the indian religion is a pa  It is
00:07:02 in which there are many religions and
00:07:05 there are Indians who are Muslims,
00:07:07 there are many Indians who are Christians, for
00:07:10 example, in Goa due to the Portuguese influence,
00:07:14 then for Hindus Hinduism
00:07:17 is the predominant religion but not the
00:07:19 only one,
00:07:21 the cow is a sacred magnet, so the
00:07:24 cows  they circulate freely on the street
00:07:27 sometimes it is very very funny because the
00:07:31 traffic stops and one can see a car
00:07:35 a bicycle a motorcycle a tutu and
00:07:41 everyone is waiting for a
00:07:44 cow
00:07:45 to pass sometimes a person approaches and
00:07:48 starts trying to push a  the cow
00:07:52 to free the transit well the truth
00:07:57 is that it is not going it was the first place I
00:08:01 visited girl I spent two months in the country one
00:08:04 month in the south and another month in the north
00:08:08 but I think it was the perfect entrance to the
00:08:11 country for this combination of  diverse
00:08:14 cultures the food the truth is that
00:08:18 I loved the food
00:08:21 even though I am Argentine I am not a
00:08:25 person who consumes a lot of meat in fact
00:08:27 I am almost a
00:08:30 vegetarian because with  I ate animal meat on very few
00:08:33 occasions and that was something that
00:08:37 I also found extremely interesting about
00:08:39 India
00:08:40 the variety of food is impressive I
00:08:43 enjoyed it every day
00:08:45 large portions
00:08:48 large plates with various types of
00:08:52 rice various types of vegetables
00:08:54 various sauces curry
00:08:57 the priest  very spicy ninja in fact
00:09:00 when you order a plate of food
00:09:05 my advice is to ask for a little spicy and
00:09:09 for a westerner it will be spicy
00:09:11 once I asked for it as it is eaten in
00:09:16 India they told him that's why it
00:09:19 wasn't spicy I don't know  imagine I started to
00:09:22 sweat I turned all red well the
00:09:27 truth is that Indian food is
00:09:29 spicy but it is delicious there is a wide
00:09:32 variety of vegetables I also
00:09:35 eat a lot of fish due to its proximity
00:09:38 to the sea the truth is that I eat
00:09:41 fish from a  It is very pleasing, so I did
00:09:44 n't try it, but there is also a huge
00:09:47 variety of fruits. It is consumed quite a
00:09:51 bit. In fact, it is very common to see people
00:09:54 selling little in the
00:09:58 stalls.  They cut off the top and put
00:10:01 a small plastic bombilla on it
00:10:06 and drink the coconut juice, which is very
00:10:10 good for the stomach. It is very
00:10:12 refreshing, as
00:10:15 well as the food
00:10:18 from the landscapes. Another thing that I found
00:10:21 very interesting is this function of
00:10:24 cultures the fact that when walking through
00:10:28 arambol or other neighboring towns that
00:10:32 are close to the beach, for example, there is
00:10:35 a well-known beach called hay
00:10:37 una, I
00:10:39 saw a typical Portuguese-style colonial church,
00:10:45 very white with some
00:10:48 tiles and a few meters away I saw a temple
00:10:53 Hindu with offerings, especially
00:10:57 flowers that people leave to the various
00:11:01 gods that India has, it is said to be
00:11:04 ninja and more, there are more than 33 million
00:11:07 gods, so well, imagine each one
00:11:10 can basically choose which god to
00:11:14 pray to or to which god they have  culture as a
00:11:19 pattern then is a very
00:11:22 interesting function of different religions
00:11:23 different ways of seeing the world but
00:11:28 also one of the things to highlight is
00:11:33 the practices  s spiritual practices
00:11:36 that the Indians have, for example,
00:11:41 yoga, meditation,
00:11:43 I had the luck and pleasure to see
00:11:46 people who are really
00:11:51 teachers in mastering one's own
00:11:54 body, mastering one's mind, using one
00:11:57 's breath, another  of the things that
00:12:00 goa says besides relaxing being in
00:12:04 the sun meeting people because there are many
00:12:07 people you can meet on the beach
00:12:10 when you go to have a coffee in a bar
00:12:13 at a music concert well
00:12:16 another thing I did was drink
00:12:19 yoga classes so I began to see little
00:12:23 by little that wonderful world that is
00:12:27 the world of mind control of
00:12:29 meditation of using one
00:12:33 's own strength so well
00:12:37 wow it was this platform that I used
00:12:41 to start the journey through the
00:12:46 line the  extremely friendly people I
00:12:50 communicated with them almost always in
00:12:52 English because the population speaks English
00:12:56 in some basic cases in other
00:12:59 cases more fluently and people
00:13:04 everywhere I went everywhere  the
00:13:06 cultural exchanges that I had
00:13:09 treated me in an extremely kind way I was
00:13:12 impressed by the hospitality
00:13:17 attitude of the people the desire to
00:13:20 share the culture and what they love
00:13:24 about their country with the good traveler
00:13:28 maybe in the future I would like to
00:13:30 tell you a little more about the rest  of
00:13:33 my trip to india since this time in
00:13:36 goa was only about two
00:13:38 weeks i really enjoyed being in the
00:13:41 company of nature meeting
00:13:44 people listening to the magnificent music that
00:13:48 is made in india i
00:13:51 hope then in the future i can
00:13:53 tell you a little more about it for
00:13:56 now see you later

190,"00:00:00 In the previous video in the last video
00:00:03 about the history of Spain or it was
00:00:07 explained that Fernando the Seventh died
00:00:12 he died but he had no sons he
00:00:16 had no boy and the first
00:00:21 Carlist war began the Carlists fought
00:00:25 those who were in favor of Carlos del
00:00:28 Hermano  of the king against the isabelinos
00:00:32 those who were in favor of isabel the
00:00:36 king's daughter who won the
00:00:39 carlistas or the isabelinos today I am going
00:00:44 to explain it to you
00:00:47 [Music]
00:00:50 ah well
00:00:51 this war lasted six years they
00:00:56 were fighting for six years from
00:01:02 1833 to 1840 and the  Carlos's supporters,
00:01:09 above all, were owners of charter
00:01:14 landowners of land
00:01:18 in Navarra and in the Basque Country and also
00:01:21 many members of the
00:01:25 Spanish Catholic Church who were
00:01:28 afraid that if the state would change if
00:01:32 the ideas of the Enlightenment entered
00:01:35 from france it became a
00:01:38 more modern state that they would lose privileges that they would
00:01:41 lose power in the
00:01:44 country and in isabel's supporters
00:01:48 was the nob  The nobles, not the
00:01:52 aristocrats, were the
00:01:55 higher positions of the church, the bishops and
00:01:58 cardinals and such were also in favor
00:02:00 of Isabel and then the bourgeoisie, the entire
00:02:04 industrial bourgeois class, with money or not,
00:02:07 and also the majority of the population, the
00:02:10 popular classes, the workers, the
00:02:13 peasants and it must be said that well they
00:02:17 were supporters of isabel but
00:02:20 at this time isabel was three years old she
00:02:23 was only three years old she was
00:02:27 a little girl so in this war
00:02:30 there were three parts in the first part
00:02:34 carlos carlos was in portugal carlos
00:02:38 is in portugal and  he leaves he goes to Navarre
00:02:42 and in Navarre in Navarre he forms his own
00:02:46 government forms his government his army and
00:02:49 here he begins to fight they begin to see
00:02:52 some battles and he manages to win he
00:02:55 manages to win some
00:02:57 battles and this is the first part in
00:03:00 the second part his army his
00:03:03 soldiers go through Spain' van ford says
00:03:07 through different places in Spain looking
00:03:10 for people to help them people
00:03:14 to join him  but people ignore them
00:03:17 most people don't want to
00:03:20 help them and they have to go back they have to
00:03:23 go back to Navarre and the Basque Country and from
00:03:26 here they decide to attack
00:03:28 Madrid- they try to attack Madrid they try to
00:03:31 enter Madrid but they don't succeed they don't
00:03:35 manage to capture Madrid  and then
00:03:38 the third part begins the third
00:03:42 stage of the war which are negotiations
00:03:45 are discussions between the two
00:03:49 parties between the carlists and the
00:03:51 isabelinos meet and agree to peace they
00:03:55 agree to end the war then the
00:03:59 carlists the carlists
00:04:02 accept that they have lost that  They
00:04:06 have not won but they negotiate several
00:04:09 conditions, they negotiate first that
00:04:12 the soldiers, the Carlist soldiers, are
00:04:15 not punished and they can
00:04:19 enter as soldiers in the
00:04:22 Isabella army and not in the army of the new
00:04:25 country after the special rules or
00:04:30 laws for  The lands, the
00:04:34 territories of the Basque Country and Navarre, are
00:04:37 negotiating so that they are discussed in the courts so
00:04:40 that they do not disappear c  ompletely but rather
00:04:44 that they can discuss how good it is to
00:04:46 try to preserve how they functioned
00:04:49 until then, not that they functioned
00:04:52 in a different way than the rest of the
00:04:56 territory of Spain so the
00:04:59 Carlists surrender but Carlos no
00:05:02 Carlos does not agree and Carlos leaves
00:05:06 France is going to  france and then in
00:05:10 1840 the first carlist war
00:05:14 ended then when the war ended isabel
00:05:18 was still small it was a war a
00:05:21 little girl so she could not be
00:05:25 the queen and the queen became María
00:05:28 Cristina María Cristina not technically
00:05:31 the queen was the regent she was  a person
00:05:35 who did the work of the king or the queen
00:05:38 but who was not the queen and that was Maria
00:05:41 Cristina because she had been the wife of
00:05:45 Fernando Seventh and was the mother of
00:05:46 Isabel then as the liberals the
00:05:51 most progressive members of the government
00:05:54 were the ones who helped the most  to María
00:05:57 Cristina, well, María Cristina puts them
00:06:01 in power, puts liberal people in
00:06:03 power of the government of Spain' and this
00:06:06 government i  He tried not to be very
00:06:10 trying to find a balance to make
00:06:14 a balanced government and to make more
00:06:17 or less everyone happy
00:06:21 that more progressive people and more
00:06:24 moderate people were all good not to go
00:06:28 too far either way
00:06:30 so this government calls
00:06:33 elections elections are held
00:06:36 Votes are held to choose the new
00:06:39 government. It was not universal suffrage.
00:06:41 Not everyone could vote. In fact,
00:06:45 a
00:06:48 small part of the population could still vote and well,
00:06:51 a moderate government was chosen, a government that was
00:06:55 a little more conservative
00:06:59 than usual.  that the progressives would
00:07:02 like it and they keep complaining they don't
00:07:05 like it so there are problems and María
00:07:08 Cristina decides to change
00:07:11 the government leader and gives mendizabal
00:07:16 a new government leader and mendizabal
00:07:20 was a liberal he was a progressive liberal and
00:07:23 mendizabal started  to make changes in the
00:07:27 government but for many people these
00:07:30 changes were too  The rapids were
00:07:34 too extreme so many people
00:07:38 did not agree with what he was
00:07:40 doing and the situation began to be
00:07:43 a bit tense and mendizabal limit
00:07:46 mendizabal leaves mendizabal stops
00:07:49 being the leader of the government and instead of
00:07:52 mendizabal they put someone else this  maybe
00:07:55 a moderate one more person a little more
00:07:59 conservative but still
00:08:03 makes people unhappy again the people are not
00:08:05 happy with this either so there are
00:08:09 people who begin to ask that
00:08:12 the constitution be approved the constitution of 1812
00:08:17 the constitution of cadiz of the courts
00:08:21 from Cádiz
00:08:22 during the Spanish war of independence
00:08:24 there is even a riot in the palace
00:08:28 in the royal palace where the queen
00:08:31 regent lives there is a riot there is like a
00:08:34 small revolution and then María
00:08:37 Cristina has to change the
00:08:40 government again so María Cristina puts
00:08:43 Calatrava  calatrava was another
00:08:47 liberal progressive who also made different
00:08:50 reforms he made changes in the government
00:08:53 then he created  a new constitution they
00:08:57 do not use the one of 1812 but they make a new one
00:09:02 in 1837 they make a new constitution
00:09:07 again elections are held but again
00:09:10 the moderates
00:09:14 win again the liberals do not win the progressives do not
00:09:17 win again the moderates
00:09:20 then the moderates approve a law
00:09:24 once  A law that generated a lot of controversy, a
00:09:26 lot of debate,
00:09:28 is the Town Hall Law. In the Town Hall Law,
00:09:31 the government is the one that
00:09:35 chooses the mayors of the town halls,
00:09:38 not every city in Spain, because Madrid,
00:09:42 Barcelona, ​​Seville, all cities
00:09:45 have a town hall. They have a
00:09:48 city government and  the mayor is the
00:09:51 person in charge because the moderates
00:09:54 say okay, it will be the government that
00:09:58 chooses the mayors but the
00:10:00 progressives thought that they
00:10:03 had to vote it had to be the
00:10:06 people who voted for the mayors of each
00:10:09 city of each town
00:10:11 then  In several cities in Spain in
00:10:15 various places in Spain there are
00:10:18 uprisings there, well, demonstrations
00:10:21 at that time, suppose  Well, the
00:10:23 demonstrations were a little stronger
00:10:26 than they are now, no, but well, Maria
00:10:29 Cristina agrees again,
00:10:32 agrees to change
00:10:35 and places Espartero, places Espartero.
00:10:39 Espartero was a soldier, he was a soldier in
00:10:42 the army, and he was a liberal soldier.
00:10:45 progressive what happens
00:10:48 that after María Cristina puts him
00:10:52 in the government the two don't get along
00:10:55 very well they are not very friends so
00:10:58 María Cristina leaves María Cristina
00:11:01 leaves she also goes to France she is
00:11:05 also going to France and in this
00:11:08 Isabel was ten years old, she was ten
00:11:12 years old, she was still a girl,
00:11:15 so the government chose Espartero
00:11:19 to be regent of Espartero, to act
00:11:22 like a king, because María Cristina is no longer here,
00:11:25 she has gone to France, so now
00:11:28 Espartero is the one who rules the most.  but with
00:11:31 espartero in the government, the other
00:11:35 progressives realize that
00:11:38 espartero stands
00:11:39 to act a bit like a dictator, not
00:11:42 like a dictator like franco hitler
00:11:45 pine  chet
00:11:47 then espartero does several things that
00:11:51 the liberals don't like and again
00:11:55 in various places in spain there are
00:11:58 uprisings there are people
00:12:01 acting against espartero and espartero is
00:12:04 also leaving this time espartero is going to
00:12:07 london london is leaving the capital of
00:12:11 england  You don't leave and you are part of it
00:12:14 too, and after all this happens
00:12:18 Isabel was only 13 years old but even
00:12:22 so the government decided to change the age
00:12:26 of majority at that time
00:12:30 in Spain I don't know how old the
00:12:33 majority was  18 years old now 18 years old
00:12:37 then
00:12:39 [Music]
00:12:40 1844 I don't know if the age of majority
00:12:46 to become an adult was 18 or not but the
00:12:49 government changed it to be 13
00:12:53 years old yes because that way Isabel was now an
00:12:57 adult and could already be  the queen and here
00:13:00 begins the reign of isabel the reign
00:13:04 of isabel the second the reign of isabel the
00:13:08 second I will explain it to you in the
00:13:12 following video I will explain how her
00:13:15 reign was and the problems that continued to

164,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about Galician, which is
00:00:03 a language that is spoken in Spain, it is
00:00:07 spoken in Galicia, and today I am going to talk
00:00:10 about whether or not it is the same
00:00:15 as Portuguese
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:23 Hello, if Galician is spoken in
00:00:28 galicia galicia is an
00:00:31 autonomous community just like this madrid andalusia
00:00:36 catalonia valencia not more than a basque country
00:00:42 because there is galicia and in galicia they speak their
00:00:47 own language a language that is a
00:00:50 romance language comes from latin just
00:00:54 like spanish portuguese italian or
00:00:58 french catalan also comes  from Latin
00:01:01 but Galician is closer to
00:01:06 Portuguese it is closer to Portuguese
00:01:09 than to Spanish they are really very similar
00:01:13 and there are some linguists who
00:01:18 say that technically
00:01:21 linguistically Portuguese and Galician
00:01:24 and dialects of the same language
00:01:27 are technically the same language only
00:01:30 that they are  different dialects then
00:01:35 portuguese portuguese sounds like this
00:01:38 after a few afternoons james flynn of 5
00:01:42 lives looking twice as much at 23 years old and
00:01:48 galician sounds that
00:01:51 good  Today they are Luis Gallegos, nothing
00:01:54 in Galicia, the inland area of ​​the
00:01:57 province of Lugo,
00:02:01 I am 24 years old. In fact, they have a common origin, they
00:02:05 come from a common language
00:02:08 called Galician-Portuguese or Galician-
00:02:12 Portuguese, and from the 12th century,
00:02:18 that is, from the 12th century.  1300-odd is
00:02:23 when Portuguese and Galician began to
00:02:28 separate, they began to diverge then for
00:02:32 historical reasons because of history, because
00:02:36 Portugal ended up being a kingdom and Galicia
00:02:40 was another kingdom and that is why in the end
00:02:47 a country of Portugal and a country ended up in different countries  Spain did not
00:02:52 have then in the past in Galicia
00:02:56 for many years for a long
00:02:59 time Galician was a language of peasants
00:03:03 a language of farmers a language of
00:03:07 country people of rude
00:03:11 people of people who were not people who had to
00:03:14 have an education a language of people
00:03:17 poor
00:03:18 then it was used less and less in
00:03:22 the government it was used less for
00:03:25 official reasons and it is only at the
00:03:28 end of the 19th century at the end of the 18th century
00:03:33 00 and I don't know enough 1880 1890 that
00:03:42 Galician begins to be a leading
00:03:46 literary language that
00:03:48 writers in Galician begin to appear who write
00:03:51 books write novels in Galician and at the
00:03:54 beginning of the 20th century in the
00:03:59 1900s and 1900s and little begin to see
00:04:03 political parties that speak  in Galician who
00:04:06 speak to people in Galician who have
00:04:09 political rallies in Galician
00:04:12 and in
00:04:15 1936 Galician is recognized as the
00:04:18 official language it becomes the official language of
00:04:22 Galicia but then came the
00:04:25 civil war and with the
00:04:28 dictatorship Galician was repressed it was repressed
00:04:31 quite a bit and  then it did not become official again
00:04:35 until 1978 with democracy with
00:04:41 Spanish democracy in
00:04:45 1978 Galician again became an
00:04:48 official language just
00:04:51 like Basque and Catalan were, Catalan or
00:04:54 Valencian because in Catalonia Valencia and the
00:04:57 Balearic Islands and just like the  Catalan and that
00:05:02 Basque Galician is used more in
00:05:06 smaller cities or in towns it is used more than in
00:05:09 large cities in large cities there are
00:05:12 more people ha  and more people who speak
00:05:15 Spanish or who use Spanish on a
00:05:18 daily basis and even now Galician is used
00:05:22 more than Catalan proportionally in
00:05:26 percentage there are more people in Galicia
00:05:28 who use it on a daily basis than people
00:05:32 who use Catalan in Catalonia but
00:05:35 not yet  It has the same level of
00:05:38 social recognition, the same
00:05:41 social status that Catalan has in
00:05:44 Catalonia, but now you still see
00:05:47 politicians speaking
00:05:49 Galician on television, politicians from
00:05:52 Galician parties who speak
00:05:54 Galician, and Galician and Portuguese
00:05:59 are so similar that  there are still people
00:06:02 well now there are people and there are
00:06:05 organizations in galicia who think
00:06:08 that galician should be written
00:06:10 differently it should be written in a
00:06:14 more similar way closer to how
00:06:17 portuguese is written
00:06:19 so let's compare compare
00:06:22 some galician words with the
00:06:25 portuguese of galician  With Portuguese it's
00:06:30 worth the word I play I play how
00:06:34 children play I don't play in Galician it's just
00:06:38 am not e  I am one hundred percent sure that
00:06:42 I am pronouncing it correctly I am not
00:06:44 sure that I am pronouncing it correctly neither
00:06:46 Galician nor Portuguese is okay
00:06:48 but I think it is so
00:06:52 Galician is show and in Portuguese it is yoga
00:06:56 yoga top show and yoga are similar game
00:07:03 in Spanish is more  It's a different game to talk about
00:07:06 the verb than to talk about how I'm
00:07:08 talking, not in this case, it's pulling
00:07:12 both, it's pulling,
00:07:14 failing and failing, the newspaper the
00:07:18 newspaper the newspaper is the same as the people when
00:07:22 there was no internet because I read in the
00:07:24 mornings not to read the news
00:07:28 in Galician it is jornal and in Portuguese it is
00:07:32 journal
00:07:34 we see that many times the x's change to
00:07:38 jacks no so you can see that they are quite
00:07:41 similar
00:07:43 now there is television there at least one
00:07:46 television channel in Galician where they
00:07:49 speak almost exclusively Galician they
00:07:52 speak maybe a little bit of Spanish  But
00:07:55 above all they speak Galician and Galician
00:07:59 is also taught.
00:08:01 The teachers speak Galician in
00:08:03 many Galician schools and by law, in
00:08:07 theory, the schools all schools.  they
00:08:10 would have to speak in Galician 50%
00:08:14 of the time or more 50% or more of the
00:08:19 classes should be in Galician in
00:08:22 practice it is less in practice Spanish is used
00:08:26 more and especially in the
00:08:29 cities in the big cities many
00:08:32 schools  they use it or very little or not at all
00:08:36 Galician is used very little
00:08:37 and if Galician is used less and
00:08:41 less each year it is used less and it is a
00:08:43 pity it would not be very sad if it was used
00:08:46 very little or if it disappeared but it seems
00:08:51 that in recent years it has  it is maintained it is
00:08:53 maintained a little more
00:08:56 this is the number of people who
00:08:58 spoke it who spoke it who spoke
00:09:01 it on a day-to-day basis in 2003 61 in 2008 56%
00:09:08 of people then 51 and in 2018 52 it seems
00:09:15 that lately well it is maintained it is
00:09:19 maintained  a little better no and so the
00:09:22 question my question is in your country
00:09:26 other languages ​​are spoken
00:09:28 there are other historical languages ​​that have been
00:09:31 spoken in your country
00:09:34 for a long time write a comment
00:09:36 and tell me which languages ​​are still spoken
00:09:40 in your country q  If they are not the majority language,
00:09:43 the language of the country is fine and if

163,"00:00:00 Before the Romans
00:00:04 came, before Latin came to Spain,
00:00:07 many people spoke this language. Watch
00:00:10 this video to find out the effects that
00:00:15 still exist today in the Spanish we
00:00:18 speak.
00:00:21 [Music]
00:00:25 Hello, well, if the book is a dead language, it
00:00:29 is a language that  today
00:00:33 it is no longer spoken it is a language that was
00:00:36 spoken in the iberian peninsula
00:00:40 before the romans came it was spoken
00:00:42 mainly in the east and south of
00:00:45 spain it
00:00:48 is believed that in the 1st century 2nd century
00:00:55 there was already  surely disappeared before
00:00:59 the year 200 year 200 after Christ
00:01:04 the libero was no longer spoken
00:01:09 and was spoken by the Iberians the Iberians were
00:01:12 a culture they were not a group of tribes they
00:01:16 were several tribes with various names and
00:01:19 the Greeks who came to Spain and the
00:01:23 Romans who came to Spain
00:01:25 wrote about them they wrote
00:01:28 about who the Iberians were and that's why
00:01:31 now we know who they were
00:01:35 we know they existed and spoke the
00:01:39 language and I see then the language they
00:01:43 spoke the libero
00:01:45 is thought  it could be that it was
00:01:49 related to Basque that they were
00:01:53 related but it is not very clear
00:01:56 so this language is not known it is not
00:02:00 known it is not known how to translate we do not know the
00:02:04 words we do not know what they meant
00:02:07 there are texts there are still written texts
00:02:12 now we have some texts  written in
00:02:15 Iberian but we don't know what they
00:02:18 mean in general we know the letters
00:02:22 we know the letters how they wrote
00:02:25 we know how to pronounce how
00:02:28 to pronounce each letter we have
00:02:32 deciphered it we have discovered each letter
00:02:35 how it was pronounced especially because
00:02:39 the Iberians had names for certain
00:02:42 places  certain cities certain rivers
00:02:45 certain areas were called in a certain way
00:02:49 the Romans later continued to
00:02:52 call them the same in the same way
00:02:54 so
00:02:56 the Iberian was written in three alphabets
00:03:00 in three different alphabets but almost
00:03:04 all the texts most of the texts in
00:03:08 Ibero are in one  alphabet then
00:03:11 well i call it alphabet but i
00:03:15 really should call it  ar writing system
00:03:19 because it is not exactly an alphabet in
00:03:23 an alphabet we have vowels
00:03:27 u
00:03:29 and we have consonants of yes well the
00:03:36 ibero was not exactly an alphabet it is
00:03:39 a mixture of syllabary and alphabet they
00:03:44 have some letters that are consonant
00:03:48 plus vowel that all comes together in one
00:03:51 letter a single a single symbol that
00:03:55 means, for example, that to another symbol that
00:04:00 means here or not but then there are
00:04:03 other consonants that go alone that do
00:04:07 not have no syllable syllabary no and
00:04:11 then there are also symbols for
00:04:14 vowels each vowel has its symbol
00:04:17 also separated then two alphabets
00:04:20 of which are known two alphabets
00:04:23 work the same they have syllables and then
00:04:27 letters also loose and the third the
00:04:31 third alphabet that was used to write
00:04:34 the book
00:04:35 is based on the Greek is based on
00:04:38 a variation of the Greek alphabet but
00:04:43 the writing  the way of writing
00:04:47 is not what has influenced Spanish, it
00:04:51 is not what is still preserved today, what is still preserved
00:04:54 today  Nowadays we can see in the
00:04:58 Spanish that we speak today they are words they
00:05:01 are some words that we have left
00:05:04 from the Iberian and some examples of words
00:05:08 that come from the Iberian are bed the bed
00:05:12 where we sleep yes yes a word as
00:05:15 common as bed comes from libero the
00:05:18 word fat  being fat fat also
00:05:21 comes from libero the word worm a
00:05:24 worm well the word worm also the
00:05:28 squirrel not the word squirrel the
00:05:31 animals that climb the trees that
00:05:34 eat eat I don't know hazelnuts well the
00:05:38 word squirrel also the word dog
00:05:41 a word as common as dog  it also
00:05:44 comes from libero and then pumpkin the
00:05:46 vegetable the pumpkin
00:05:48 the mud when there is earth mixed with
00:05:51 water the mud the word mud also
00:05:54 all these words come from liberó
00:05:58 even the name of the ebro river the ebro river
00:06:02 is one of the largest rivers in
00:06:05 spain
00:06:05 the  ebro river that comes good comes through
00:06:08 here
00:06:09 the ebro river the origin of the word ebro
00:06:13 is the same as that of iberia and it is the
00:06:16 same as that of íberos si ento  Before the
00:06:20 word ebro olivero, which means it
00:06:23 meant riverside, it meant the
00:06:27 banks the banks of the river and that is why
00:06:30 the ebro river is now called the ebro
00:06:34 and that's it I hope you found it
00:06:37 interesting to know more about the language
00:06:40 that was spoken in Spain before
00:06:44 that Spanish was spoken before Latin was spoken
00:06:47 and to see how it has still influenced us and how it
00:06:51 has still left its
00:06:54 mark on modern Spanish and if
00:06:57 you know of similar examples in
00:07:01 your country if you know of
00:07:04 languages ​​that were spoken in your country in the past
00:07:07 but that they are no longer talked about,
00:07:10 that they have already disappeared, then
00:07:13 writing it below in a comment is
00:07:15 also worth it and if you like them if you like

197,"00:00:00 Here in this studio it's very hot,
00:00:04 very hot
00:00:05 so I'm going to cover the windows with
00:00:09 this film with this film so
00:00:14 that less heat enters the studio
00:00:19 and today I'm going to show you how I stick the
00:00:23 film to the windows
00:00:27 [Music]
00:00:31 Hi, well, I do have this  film that
00:00:36 is quite transparent it looks
00:00:40 good but it protects from infrared it
00:00:45 makes less heat enter the
00:00:49 room and well it's a good idea because
00:00:53 here in thailand it's very hot and
00:00:57 especially in the afternoon the sun shines
00:01:01 directly  and in this room
00:01:04 in the studio it's very hot so
00:01:08 I bought these rolls these rolls of
00:01:12 film I bought
00:01:14 44 because I have two windows here I have
00:01:18 two more windows downstairs and
00:01:22 then in the bedroom there are four more
00:01:25 there are four more windows so in the
00:01:28 end I  I had to buy four
00:01:31 rolls, four rolls that I will have to
00:01:34 cut and today, well, I am going to show you
00:01:38 all the steps.
00:01:46 Because I've never done it I've never
00:01:51 glued film to windows and it seems a
00:01:56 bit difficult I've watched videos on youtube
00:02:01 on how to glue it and it's a bit difficult
00:02:05 so when I bought the film it
00:02:08 came with a cutter and it came with this
00:02:13 tool which is a tool for
00:02:15 how to smooth the film to remove
00:02:19 bubbles or drops because you will see
00:02:23 you have to use water for
00:02:27 the window film but the first thing is to clean
00:02:31 well or well scrub because you used a
00:02:34 damp cloth a damp microfiber biscuit
00:02:38 not wet with water and I have  to
00:02:42 scrub the windows and clean them well
00:02:49 okay now I have to cut
00:02:54 I have to cut the film but first
00:02:59 I have to see how much I need how
00:03:03 long it has to be for that first I'm going
00:03:08 to wet the window buoy
00:03:10 I'm going to put water through the window
00:03:17 so that  the film sticks let's
00:03:21 paste it
00:03:25 [Applause]
00:03:26 well no it doesn't stick haha ​​but well I
00:03:31 can cut
00:03:32 it I can cut it here let's see
00:03:38 yes yes that's enough
00:03:43 then to paste  r the film has
00:03:47 to be wet yes and here I have prepared
00:03:51 soapy water
00:03:54 good water water with shampoo and the videos I
00:04:00 have seen say to mix the water with
00:04:03 baby shampoo but I don't have babies
00:04:08 I don't have johnson and johnson do not
00:04:11 recommend shampoo  johnson and
00:04:13 johnson I don't have it, I've put another
00:04:16 shampoo on it, but hey, it's a lot of water and
00:04:19 a little bit of shampoo, so first
00:04:22 you have to separate the film from the
00:04:27 protective layer that it has and for this we can
00:04:30 use tape, we stick tape here and on the
00:04:35 other side  and here we can separate it let's
00:04:39 see let's see it can be separated
00:04:42 yes yes yes it's separating let's see let's see
00:04:45 this is very difficult so this here
00:04:50 has static electricity so
00:04:54 that all the dust in the
00:04:57 air doesn't get in so that it doesn't stick  we
00:05:00 have to spray water on it spray water on it
00:05:05 well I think it will be easier on the floor
00:05:09 come on
00:05:16 [Applause]
00:05:18 okay and now let's see if I can stick it
00:05:23 without there being wrinkles without it wrinkling
00:05:30 so with this tool
00:05:33 I'm going to in  Trying to remove all the bubbles,
00:05:37 the water and the wrinkles,
00:05:43 well, fatal, not very, very bad, it
00:05:48 turned out very badly, well, it's still very bad, very
00:05:52 bad, already in the video on YouTube, it already
00:05:56 seemed difficult, very difficult, and when
00:05:59 I tried it, well, it's a  disaster is
00:06:03 very bad very bad but ok for
00:06:05 now I'm going to do it like this now I'm going to
00:06:08 cut with the cutter I'm going to cut the
00:06:12 edges ok I'm going to try using this
00:06:18 I don't know in the video they use a tool
00:06:22 that I don't have I don't have that one  tool
00:06:25 and I don't know how to do it this is soft it's
00:06:29 very soft no it doesn't work very well I'm going to
00:06:32 do it freehand only with my
00:06:35 hand
00:06:37 well this has turned out
00:06:40 quite well yes I think it's the best thing it
00:06:44 has turned out better
00:06:48 we already have one we have a window  already
00:06:52 glued cut out yes well this is one of
00:06:57 the following ones I am not going to show
00:07:01 you why it would be a bit boring
00:07:04 but I will show you the final result
00:07:08 so you can see if I have learned if it is
00:07:13 improved if you have done the second the third
00:07:17 the fourth  done better  okay I'll
00:07:21 show you at the end okay I've
00:07:25 done all four I've finished this
00:07:28 room I haven't done the other
00:07:31 room yet but the others have turned out
00:07:35 better in the first one there have been many
00:07:39 bubbles there are no bubbles bubbles but
00:07:44 the others
00:07:46 are much better it turned out  almost
00:07:48 perfect almost perfect there are no bubbles
00:07:55 these have also turned out well
00:08:00 there are a little bubbles around here a little
00:08:03 but not many and the bubbles there
00:08:07 are smaller and this has been thanks
00:08:11 to putting a lot of water a lot of
00:08:16 soapy water much much much more  amount that
00:08:20 everything is very well wet and
00:08:23 my wife has helped me my wife gym has
00:08:26 helped me to hold it to hold it both
00:08:30 and it has been easier easier to
00:08:34 put this one put this one and put these two these
00:08:39 two below and today is up to date  The following
00:08:43 yesterday I finished pasting the windows here in
00:08:48 the studio but in the afternoon the sun shines
00:08:52 here and it is very hot and I left it for the
00:08:56 next day and today we have pasted
00:09:00 the windows of the bedroom in the
00:09:02 room  ation where we sleep and they have turned out
00:09:05 better we have already learned we have done it
00:09:09 together me and my wife
00:09:12 and using a lot of spray a lot of water and it has
00:09:15 turned out well they have turned out quite well and
00:09:18 now I am going to show you how they work
00:09:22 we are going to see how they work then you see
00:09:25 that I am going to  use the remote the handle as an
00:09:30 example with the remote you can see that it
00:09:33 emits infrared
00:09:35 these are infrared so here
00:09:40 the infrared is quite a lot but with the
00:09:44 filter you can see very little you can see a lot
00:09:46 less you can't see a lot a little a lot a little
00:09:53 so in theory it would have to
00:09:57 help  don't get so hot in theory in
00:10:00 practice we'll see if it works well or
00:10:03 if maybe it's not very noticeable okay bye

",3
106,"00:00:00 I am Camilo and today I am going to talk about the
00:00:07 Day of the Dead in Mexico
00:00:13 [Music]
00:00:17 Since last year it came out as a
00:00:20 Disney movie
00:00:23 [Music]
00:00:25 there has been a lot of talk about the Day of the Dead and
00:00:28 Mexico but really it is the Day of the
00:00:32 Dead  Because it is celebrated as it is
00:00:35 celebrated, let's see it in a moment. The
00:00:40 Day of the Dead is perhaps the
00:00:43 most Mexican celebration in Mexico. The
00:00:47 most important celebration is Christmas,
00:00:49 but Christmas is celebrated everywhere
00:00:56 on the Day of the Dead, not on the Day of the Dead.
00:00:59 It is something very Mexican and what
00:01:03 the day of the dead consists of because it is very easy
00:01:07 basically it is a day in which our
00:01:10 relatives or friends already dead come
00:01:15 home to eat, drink, sing and dance
00:01:21 with us with their family and although the
00:01:26 day of the dead is celebrated  Almost in all of
00:01:29 Mexico, in each place it has a different flavor.
00:01:33 In each place it is celebrated in
00:01:36 a different way, but there are certain
00:01:39 common characteristics, for example,
00:01:43 on the Day of the Dead, there must
00:01:45 first be an offering.
00:01:51 I'm sorry, but it's an offering
00:01:57 because an offering is a table
00:02:01 with
00:02:02 and many things that things things that
00:02:06 our relative or
00:02:08 our dead friend liked, for example food,
00:02:14 what food did he like, did he like mole,
00:02:18 enchiladas, some tacos, then on the
00:02:23 table  they put mole enchiladas tacos that
00:02:28 he liked to drink he liked tequila
00:02:31 the soda well he puts tequila
00:02:35 soda
00:02:37 what things did he like for example what
00:02:40 things in the house or did he like music
00:02:43 he puts on a guitar he liked
00:02:47 paint you can put some
00:02:49 paint  some picture yes it is also very
00:02:53 important to have the photo of the person
00:02:56 the photo is put on the table in the
00:03:00 main place in the middle it is also
00:03:05 put many flowers many flowers so
00:03:08 that the table looks beautiful the offering that
00:03:11 is put the most is put  candles candles are very
00:03:16 important candles for good
00:03:19 we already know that candles are something that
00:03:22 fire evokes spirituality yes
00:03:26 then to welcome that
00:03:29 soul that has already left d  To welcome you
00:03:32 back to our homes,
00:03:35 candles are essential
00:03:39 [Music]
00:03:42 [Applause]
00:03:44 and then, in addition to the offering, depending
00:03:48 on the region of Mexico,
00:03:52 a path of flowers is also made on the street,
00:03:56 a path of flowers that leads to the
00:03:59 door of  the house
00:04:01 like this the dead man when he comes back from the other
00:04:03 world who has been here for a while
00:04:08 since he didn't come back maybe he
00:04:10 died many years ago and he doesn't quite remember
00:04:12 how to get back home
00:04:14 so he puts a path of flowers
00:04:16 to return to the house in other
00:04:20 regions of mexico, for example, in the
00:04:23 southeast, the festival of the dead is not
00:04:28 done at home, it is done in the streets or in
00:04:32 the pantheons in the cemetery the
00:04:35 whole family goes to the cemetery and they have the
00:04:39 party there so they bring food they bring
00:04:43 drinks usually alcohol they
00:04:47 get drunk  a little and they
00:04:50 also have music sometimes they have
00:04:53 live music for example a
00:04:56 mariachi music group or a trio of
00:05:00 traditional music and they are eating singing
00:05:06 dancing drinking very happy everything and  l day
00:05:13 all day from morning until
00:05:17 night in some areas
00:05:24 they even take the dead person's bones out of
00:05:30 the grave box they clean
00:05:35 them they accommodate them with the family and eat
00:05:40 with them they dance they sing with the
00:05:44 bones there
00:05:46 I
00:05:49 am very  impressive in other
00:05:52 regions people go out into the street for example in
00:05:57 the west of mexico there is a
00:06:00 very beautiful area of ​​lakes and what people do
00:06:03 have their offerings outside the house the
00:06:07 tables with the candles the flowers the
00:06:10 food everything is not inside  the house if
00:06:13 it were not the whole town is filled with
00:06:16 flowers and candles and in the afternoon all
00:06:21 the people go to the port of the lake
00:06:25 they go in vain in boats or in
00:06:29 small rafts with flower candles to an
00:06:34 island in the lake called janitzio
00:06:39 and  It is very nice to see that all the
00:06:42 boats arriving towards the center or towards
00:06:46 the island that is in the center of the lake
00:06:47 then once on the island they fill all the
00:06:52 streets of the island with candles and flowers
00:06:55 and then they can start praying or
00:06:59 singing or  eat or dance or all together
00:07:03 all at the same time
00:07:19 in mexico city where i am from
00:07:23 there is a very special festival a
00:07:27 few years ago a few years ago they began to
00:07:31 make the day of the dead a
00:07:34 carnival type festivity that is to say that people go out
00:07:38 at  streets disguised as the dead
00:07:46 they paint themselves make up they dress in
00:07:49 black clothes or very bright colors like the
00:07:53 colors that we like in
00:07:56 Mexico and they go out into the streets in a kind
00:07:59 of carnival parade but of the dead
00:08:04 there is music at the dance there is food everything  in
00:08:07 the street like a carnival if now
00:08:12 this was not like that before that is something new
00:08:16 since the james bond movie
00:08:24 [Music]
00:08:35 [Music]
00:08:38 not
00:08:39 for this movie the government of mexico
00:08:43 gave money to put the
00:08:47 first scene of the movie like  a
00:08:49 carnival parade on the day of the
00:08:51 dead that did not exist was made for the
00:08:56 movie but from then on it will be done every
00:09:00 year I love it but it
00:09:03 is something new and very beautiful by the way
00:09:09 well we now understood more  or less how
00:09:12 the day of the dead is celebrated but what
00:09:15 we have not said is where does that come
00:09:18 from why is that done why have a
00:09:21 party with the dead well for that
00:09:24 we have to understand something Mexico
00:09:28 before the arrival of the Spanish and  of
00:09:30 Europeans in general
00:09:32 in 1500 in 1492 2500 that was the
00:09:37 conquest before that time Mexico did not
00:09:41 exist that there was then in what is now
00:09:45 Mexico in that territory
00:09:48 at that time there was a series of countries
00:09:53 empires independent city-states with some
00:09:58 independence or  No, and each one with their
00:10:02 own traditions with their own language, they
00:10:04 were different ethnic groups
00:10:08 with their own customs and
00:10:12 their own language, however, there was something
00:10:16 that united them, which was the idea of
00:10:22 death for the majority of the
00:10:27 indigenous populations of America,
00:10:31 death.  It is not something bad, it is simply
00:10:36 a part of life, we are born, we live and
00:10:42 we die, it is one of the steps of
00:10:45 life, so it was not seen as something
00:10:48 bad, simply as one more step of the process.
00:10:51 cessation of life
00:10:55 and there was also another belief that the
00:10:58 dead souls were left around
00:11:01 so at a certain moment they could
00:11:05 see us again
00:11:07 this belief is also shared somewhat
00:11:10 with europe and what happens with the
00:11:14 conquest when the europeans arrive in
00:11:17 america and different
00:11:20 civilizations meet  different cultures
00:11:23 different customs there is a
00:11:27 very strong culture shock but there is a
00:11:31 coincidence in europe they also
00:11:34 celebrated the day of the dead yes and
00:11:39 what a coincidence that it was also
00:11:41 celebrated on the same date on november 1 and 2
00:11:47 so it was perfect they did not
00:11:51 arrive the europeans are in  America and they
00:11:55 see that that day coincides to celebrate
00:11:59 the dead, so over time it
00:12:03 mixes and becomes something a
00:12:06 bit European and a bit American
00:12:11 with all the traditional customs
00:12:14 of America and adding a bit of
00:12:18 European customs so today  Nowadays
00:12:22 you can see that a very
00:12:25 old custom but with a bit of a European flavor.
00:12:29 Well, what do you think?  The Day of
00:12:33 the Dead is very interesting, even
00:12:36 if you don't believe in it, it's very nice to go and
00:12:39 see it, it's very pleasing to the eyes, besides,
00:12:42 you eat very well and there is good music,
00:12:45 you dance, you have fun, it's a happy party,
00:12:49 there is joy, I hope that  you liked it
00:12:53 and see you in the next one
00:12:54 I'm on my way see you later

",3
101,"00:00:00 Judith today you are going to tell us about your
00:00:05 work if you look at me what you worked
00:00:10 payers did and what you are going to
00:00:14 explain to us who you were
00:00:16 helping
00:00:18 precisely in this case to refugees to
00:00:22 refugees to people fleeing because of
00:00:24 problems in their country in por  war and he
00:00:27 comes to take refuge in Spain
00:00:29 exactly very well
00:00:34 [Music]
00:00:37 hello Judith Pablo thanks for coming
00:00:42 back to the channel and I'm going to help us
00:00:45 record more videos well this is very
00:00:49 interesting because I haven't met
00:00:51 any other person who works well
00:00:54 with  Refugees
00:00:56 I am very common no but well there are
00:01:01 many there are refugee centers well
00:01:04 in several places at least in
00:01:06 several places in Europe no yes yes and if
00:01:11 there are many yes okay then can you
00:01:13 explain a little to us what was the work of the
00:01:18 center of the center  Where did you work?
00:01:22 If I worked in a center for
00:01:26 refugees and asylum seekers, okay,
00:01:30 then they are people who are fleeing the
00:01:34 war or seeking asylum who are asking to
00:01:37 enter the country due to ex-problems.
00:01:41 We activate either personal problems
00:01:44 that have to do with
00:01:47 oneself, with the same person or
00:01:49 problems that the exact country has,
00:01:52 exists in these two types of
00:01:55 people, whether it is a personal persecution
00:01:57 or a business problem or for whatever is
00:02:01 exact.  yes yes or for sexual orientation
00:02:04 also in many cases because in
00:02:07 some countries there is even a death penalty
00:02:11 exact then many of these people
00:02:14 manage to flee their country and
00:02:18 go to a country where they are welcomed
00:02:22 as asylum seekers they ask for
00:02:25 extra asylum  It is normally to go
00:02:28 to a country if you are from outside the European Union you
00:02:32 need some type of visa or
00:02:34 permit to work in the country but if
00:02:38 you ask for asylum it is another method another way
00:02:41 to be able to be exact it
00:02:45 is a more risky way because with
00:02:48 the visa you can  traveling by plane but if
00:02:52 you ask for asylum it means that
00:02:55 in many cases you have not been able to apply for a
00:02:58 visa to travel by plane then you
00:03:01 travel in a much more
00:03:03 risky way  Well, they come by land or in
00:03:06 vargas formally because in Spain that
00:03:10 is a problem that many people who come
00:03:13 to ask for asylum or immigrants come by
00:03:16 sea and make a road and it is very
00:03:18 risky not exactly if it is very
00:03:20 risky then it happens a lot in
00:03:25 Spain, because we are very close to
00:03:27 Africa, there are only a few kilometers, so a
00:03:31 lot happens constantly, which shows an
00:03:34 exact risk. Many people risk their
00:03:36 lives, stop to be able to flee from either
00:03:41 personal persecution or from the country, and
00:03:45 that affects the work you do in the
00:03:49 center of  Somehow, of
00:03:50 course, many of the people who live
00:03:54 in these centers have arrived in Spain in
00:03:58 this way, irregularly, and
00:04:01 some of them, perhaps, someone in
00:04:04 their family or something has died in the sea.
00:04:08 Yes, many people
00:04:13 that I have met through my  work they
00:04:15 have lost either family or friends
00:04:18 in this on those journeys to
00:04:21 move to in this case to Spain if it
00:04:24 happens it is a lot if you never see the
00:04:29 news because r  It turns out not to be
00:04:32 interesting, good, or important, you hear a
00:04:35 lot about it in the news, but of course,
00:04:38 so much happens, it happens so often that in the end it is
00:04:40 a number, it is an excellent statistic,
00:04:43 and this week 20 is worth this week 20,
00:04:46 exactly
00:04:47 yes yes yes no the importance is not given
00:04:53 What should it stop from my point of view
00:04:58 then
00:05:01 I worked in a center for these
00:05:05 people who were either from their country
00:05:07 so this center was a house like
00:05:11 a family house it will be a
00:05:13 normal house yes exactly the only thing is
00:05:17 the administration  or someone from the
00:05:19 government had bought it or had
00:05:22 rented it to turn it into a
00:05:25 center
00:05:26 but it was not a huge house with
00:05:29 many rooms no
00:05:32 in fact the rooms that it had
00:05:35 were one two three four there were four
00:05:38 rooms
00:05:40 that were not very big they have bunk beds
00:05:43 and they were shared rooms, okay, it was
00:05:45 an exact dormitory type, they were with bunk beds,
00:05:49 one bed on top of the other and they were
00:05:52 shared, it's in that house and well, ten
00:05:55 people v  Alright, in four rooms,
00:05:57 it will be two or three by four per
00:06:01 room, the exact following, and you get a
00:06:04 bed below and one above.
00:06:06 That is, then, the
00:06:10 workers' office was in the parking lot of the
00:06:13 house.
00:06:15 parking
00:06:18 cars
00:06:25 then it was very simple if
00:06:30 anything happened in the house or if
00:06:32 people needed anything they
00:06:36 could talk to us because
00:06:37 we were below okay they could come at
00:06:40 any exact moment yes and you
00:06:43 in the day to day what work did
00:06:47 you do with those  people, of course, the
00:06:50 first thing we did the first moment
00:06:53 they arrived
00:06:54 and explain to them what we were going to
00:06:57 do during the time they were going to live
00:07:00 there
00:07:02 because they didn't know it, of course, they didn't know what to
00:07:05 expect, if in the future there is a war
00:07:07 here and I'm going to  another country as a refugee
00:07:11 I don't know what options there are or what I can do
00:07:14 exactly what awaits you if I'm going to be here for
00:07:17 a month if I'm going to be in prison I'm going to be
00:07:20 six explain  We used to know all the time how long
00:07:23 people were in that house,
00:07:26 normally six months
00:07:29 unless it was exceptional
00:07:34 that it was less months or a little more
00:07:37 for some person, a special case,
00:07:40 you could allow more exact
00:07:44 time, so the first thing we did when I
00:07:47 arrived at a house  person was to go to the
00:07:51 town hall and do the census it
00:07:54 is worth registering is when you
00:07:57 sign up you register as if you are living in a
00:08:00 place you have an address that you
00:08:02 then need to do some paperwork
00:08:05 not with the government administration
00:08:07 you have to have an exact
00:08:11 address especially it was  The first thing we did
00:08:13 because without the census you can't have
00:08:17 a health card it's okay because in Spain
00:08:21 you have a card that the card
00:08:23 allows you to go to the
00:08:25 Zaira hospital to listen to the public clinics
00:08:31 and to be cured and to be seen by a doctor
00:08:33 because normally good  we call
00:08:36 clinics the clinic is like a
00:08:39 clinic but it is public
00:08:42 you have to go to the one you
00:08:45 have  to which you can go according to your
00:08:47 address depending on where you live, you have an
00:08:50 outpatient clinic that you have to go to and for
00:08:52 that they have to behave healthcare in
00:08:55 Spain is public but is governed by the
00:08:58 census without a census you can only
00:09:02 access emergency healthcare if you have
00:09:08 thanks an accident or something very serious
00:09:13 to have a medical follow-up we
00:09:15 need the register
00:09:17 so it will be the first thing we do and
00:09:20 after the register and we go directly
00:09:22 to the clinic to make the health card
00:09:27 and it was very important to visit the
00:09:31 doctor immediately to all the people
00:09:34 Because in Spain, by law, each
00:09:40 person has to have vaccinations and
00:09:43 you have to make sure that everyone
00:09:45 is well vaccinated. Exactly, because in
00:09:48 other countries the mandatory vaccines
00:09:50 are others or there is none, it could not be anymore
00:09:55 because there simply isn't the
00:09:58 money or exact health standards
00:10:00 or perhaps because there are some
00:10:03 diseases that are not successful in
00:10:06 Spain to be protected exactly from a
00:10:08 lot  s diseases that exist in other
00:10:11 countries and do not exist in Spain and there are
00:10:14 others that exist in Spain and do not exist in other
00:10:16 countries, then each person is
00:10:20 given a vaccination card where
00:10:23 all the vaccines that the person
00:10:26 has have are written down and if they do not have any  They put it
00:10:29 in the outpatient clinic very well
00:10:31 already on the first day
00:10:33 the first day or the second not very well
00:10:36 very efficient if it is very important
00:10:41 because then after that first or
00:10:44 second day we start talking about what
00:10:49 the person is going to do during those months
00:10:53 explain exactly so it is very
00:10:56 important to only use the first
00:10:59 few days for the administrative procedures
00:11:07 exactly
00:11:09 exact and then we talk about what you
00:11:13 expect from your life in Spain what
00:11:18 you have is worth then the person has
00:11:20 to explain what they want they can decide
00:11:22 what exactly and  which are normally the
00:11:27 options that they have
00:11:30 depends on the origin of the country of the
00:11:33 person will have to study Spanish or
00:11:38 does not have to face the visible language
00:11:40 the idi  Of course, if you come from
00:11:43 Latin America, you will already speak Spanish
00:11:46 because it is the native language of those
00:11:49 people, but if you come from Russia, for example, you will
00:11:52 not speak Spanish, surely you
00:11:55 have to learn it, it's cool, so it's the
00:11:59 first point, there is no option this year, you
00:12:03 have to learn Spanish  because
00:12:05 otherwise you cannot integrate into
00:12:07 society, not exactly, if you could not live
00:12:11 without knowing Spanish because many
00:12:13 people who come from all over
00:12:16 the world speak
00:12:20 exact English and speak English
00:12:24 but to be able to find a
00:12:27 job more easily and to be able to
00:12:30 to rent a flat to be able to
00:12:34 survive easily in Spain
00:12:37 in Barcelona you need to speak
00:12:38 Spanish
00:12:40 so during those six months that the
00:12:43 person has a house insured they
00:12:47 have to focus on studying
00:12:49 Spanish okay if they don't speak it they
00:12:52 have to concentrate on that exactly
00:12:55 Your full-time job is to
00:12:58 learn exact Spanish. Yes,
00:13:03 then it is also a very important thing.
00:13:08 There is a psychological follow-up
00:13:12 because many people have gone through
00:13:15 very traumatic, very
00:13:17 difficult situations that we have to work on. Okay,
00:13:22 so there is a psychologist, a therapist
00:13:24 who talks to them exactly, who helps to
00:13:29 work through those difficult situations so
00:13:32 that the person can overcome them and the
00:13:35 therapist  He goes home he is
00:13:39 always at home
00:13:40 until there always working there if he
00:13:43 works there with us in the parking lot
00:13:45 downstairs okay and Spanish is taught
00:13:49 there at home or they go to another place to
00:13:51 learn it they go both places are taught they
00:13:55 go to a school  public and then in
00:13:58 the public school grammar is taught, it
00:14:00 is a normalized
00:14:06 basic level Spanish course and the hours when they
00:14:10 are not at school volunteers come to
00:14:13 the house to reinforce the Spanish to
00:14:17 speak to have conversation
00:14:20 to solve doubts
00:14:24 because all the  Spanish is spoken every day
00:14:28 during the six months if the line is not made
00:14:31 constantly there are people speaking
00:14:33 Spanish yes it is very impo  rtant
00:14:37 yes yes yes it will surely help them they can
00:14:39 improve a lot exactly in fact there are many
00:14:44 people who learn very quickly but it is
00:14:47 true that there are people who take a
00:14:49 long time to return or it is not six
00:14:51 months there is no time to learn a
00:14:54 language correctly to be able to
00:14:58 Communicate if you are alone in the middle of
00:15:02 Barcelona there are people who find it very difficult,
00:15:04 especially for non-
00:15:06 exact Spanish work, of course you have to
00:15:10 have a fairly high level to be able to
00:15:13 work, for example, in a store in
00:15:15 Barcelona as a salesperson you have to have
00:15:19 a high level that  it is difficult to
00:15:22 achieve
00:15:25 and no and what happens after these
00:15:27 six months
00:15:29 after these six months if everything goes
00:15:32 well
00:15:34 if everything goes well if the person complies with
00:15:38 what we have agreed they move on to another phase
00:15:42 of the same program then the
00:15:45 person instead  If they live in the same house
00:15:49 , they are given money so that they can
00:15:52 rent a room
00:15:54 and if they are given money so that they can
00:15:56 buy food,
00:15:58 then the person  With our help,
00:16:02 the workers look for a rented room,
00:16:05 okay, they look for their own
00:16:08 rented room, a room, they
00:16:10 pay with the money you give them, they pay the
00:16:13 exact rent, and this is a
00:16:17 very important practice of what they have
00:16:19 learned in Spanish during this
00:16:22 time, because  That person alone has to
00:16:25 find the room to talk to the
00:16:28 owner agree on the price of the
00:16:31 room the working conditions the
00:16:33 treatment
00:16:36 and Judith for you what has been the
00:16:40 most difficult thing in this job what
00:16:43 has cost
00:16:45 you the most what has been the most  It has been
00:16:50 difficult for me when there has been a complicated situation or
00:16:53 when I have seen that a person has
00:16:55 gone through a very complicated situation in
00:16:57 their life to
00:16:59 disconnect from everything that they had
00:17:02 explained to me at the beginning,
00:17:05 especially when I went home after
00:17:08 work.  I couldn't stop thinking about work all the
00:17:11 time and you were still worried
00:17:13 about what had happened to these
00:17:15 exact people and then what I felt the most
00:17:20 It was bad when you got out of work not to think
00:17:24 about work
00:17:26 because of course it's very difficult, your
00:17:29 work
00:17:31 is not something you need to be in,
00:17:35 that is, it doesn't help to really think about
00:17:37 work when you're away, it's not going to
00:17:39 help you either, you're not going to worry anymore
00:17:42 about  be exact if it doesn't help at all
00:17:46 because you can't do anything because of that situation that
00:17:49 you can't forget
00:17:52 about, it's already in the past you can't change
00:17:54 it exactly if you work there the only
00:17:57 thing you can do is help in the
00:17:59 present so it was hard for me to give myself
00:18:03 I realize that it is useless to think
00:18:06 about work outside of work and
00:18:09 now when I finally leave work
00:18:13 I no longer remember, not until I arrived
00:18:15 at the morning, I do not remember that you have
00:18:18 learned to disconnect exactly and you
00:18:21 did it  Somehow you used some
00:18:23 trick or something or not, with time you
00:18:27 learn it went like this if you learn with time
00:18:30 I think if I don't do it better the
00:18:32 job if now I do it very well only
00:18:36 one day something very punctual happens that  It
00:18:40 's a very complicated situation so
00:18:43 I can remember but I don't remember in
00:18:46 the same way I'm not thinking all the time
00:18:50 I just remember
00:18:52 and I don't worry I just remember and you
00:18:55 like it you like the job yes I like it a
00:18:58 lot like that yes why not  I know when you
00:19:01 studied it I don't know if you expected this you
00:19:05 expected it to be the way it is no no no no I did
00:19:09 n't expect anything this in fact I
00:19:13 expected something very different but I didn't know
00:19:16 if I was going to like it because when I
00:19:18 was studying it I didn't like it very much
00:19:20 ok  You didn't like studying it very much, you
00:19:23 didn't think when we were studying we thought
00:19:25 it would be a job perhaps more boring,
00:19:29 yes, but also with fewer
00:19:31 psychological and functional challenges, yes, exactly, if I
00:19:34 thought it would be a lot more paperwork, a
00:19:38 lot more to be in front of the computer,
00:19:41 okay, but I've realized  No,
00:19:44 well, I don't know, I don't know if another person who
00:19:46 studies the same as you will have
00:19:49 more office work and paperwork and that
00:19:51 is possible, if possible,
00:19:55 luckily I have found  I have brought
00:19:57 from my profession a job that I like
00:19:59 very well, it is ideal, it is not
00:20:02 perfect, and I think that many many good people,
00:20:07 many of us Spanish, well,
00:20:10 our ideal is to have a job that
00:20:11 you are good at or that you like the job or
00:20:14 that you like
00:20:16 your coworkers and have a good time and then when you
00:20:19 can you can go on vacation and
00:20:22 basically enjoy life I think that
00:20:28 most of the people here are looking for this
00:20:30 I know very well well thank you very much for
00:20:33 explaining your work for contaminating and
00:20:36 well yes I hope that  Come back too

108,"00:00:00 Today we are going to play Done Start, a game
00:00:05 of not dying
00:00:10 [Music]
00:00:14 Good, yes, where to be you have to not
00:00:19 die because if you die it's over and
00:00:25 the game is over and
00:00:29 the world disappears, your world, everything
00:00:33 you've built the most disappears  and
00:00:37 you have to start over you have to
00:00:41 start from the beginning yes yes so do
00:00:44 n't have to die
00:00:46 come on let's make a new game there are
00:00:50 several characters several characters but
00:00:55 since it is not played yet there is only
00:00:58 one character the scientist wilson and
00:01:04 wilson has a beard  He has a beard and
00:01:08 the truth is that it's going very well that it can help
00:01:11 revive him to come back to life but hey I
00:01:15 don't know if one is going to be useful or I'm going to
00:01:18 die very quickly it's
00:01:20 okay to start
00:01:22 [Music] it's
00:01:25 okay generating the world let's see
00:01:28 what then  it happens where start as its name
00:01:32 indicates the name where to be you have to
00:01:35 eat you have to eat if you don't eat you
00:01:38 die
00:01:40 also it gets dark it gets dark
00:01:43 it gets dark with the moon the
00:01:46 stars come wait friend you don't
00:01:49 look very good  better find something to
00:01:51 eat before the night comes
00:01:55 before it gets dark and yes in this game
00:01:58 if it gets dark you have to have
00:02:02 fire you have to have some fire
00:02:05 fire don't light these fires
00:02:09 if you don't have fire if it gets dark they
00:02:11 come  monsters come monsters and
00:02:16 eat you and if when winter comes if
00:02:21 winter comes and you don't have fire well
00:02:25 it's cold it's cold and you die if
00:02:29 [Music]
00:02:33 there's one
00:02:35 you have to take look at grass we have
00:02:38 grass
00:02:39 there are also trees small trees with
00:02:43 sticks don't you  they give sticks and you have to have you have
00:02:46 to have a lot of things you have to take a
00:02:49 lot of things because then they are very
00:02:51 useful look there are rabbits bunnies
00:02:57 more grass
00:02:59 so
00:03:01 with grass you can make fires I
00:03:05 don't also need trees logs but
00:03:09 to have logs you have to cut down trees
00:03:12 this  It is similar to minecraft but it is
00:03:15 different it is very different
00:03:18 to have a house I need
00:03:21 stones of these stones
00:03:24 so
00:03:27 where do I find these stones I don't know
00:03:30 let's explore
00:03:33 because if it gets dark and I don't have
00:03:35 stones I'll die I'm not going to die if
00:03:40 the monsters are going to come look there's a
00:03:42 big stone but there's no small stones
00:03:50 also bad and a carrot well I have
00:03:54 a little bit of food
00:03:57 oh look there  and
00:04:03 stones flint stones or I think we call it
00:04:06 flint flint is the stone that prehistoric humans
00:04:11 used they did like this and it
00:04:14 breaks it breaks and it is very very sharp they
00:04:16 cut or the stone cuts and with this
00:04:20 stone I can I can make an ax
00:04:24 so I think now  I can do
00:04:27 yes, ax and pick,
00:04:30 very good I have a pick, it's also very good,
00:04:35 I have both and with the ax I can
00:04:39 install or cut down the tree
00:04:42 [Music]
00:04:45 ok
00:04:47 late afternoon before the tree felling very
00:04:51 good perfect
00:04:53 now I can make a fire if I already have  to
00:04:57 make a type of fire the smallest fire
00:04:59 for the big one
00:05:01 I need rocks and the rocks yes I
00:05:05 remember I remember to
00:05:07 get rocks you have to break these
00:05:10 rocks
00:05:11 you have to break these rocks with your pick
00:05:16 with your pick you have to break the  rocks
00:05:20 and now I have stones very well I can
00:05:22 make a game
00:05:25 there is also if they have been given flint there was
00:05:29 some more true rock I am going to take
00:05:32 advantage of it and to the attic it does not cost me
00:05:36 anything
00:05:39 and that is so it is this sulfur
00:05:43 miter
00:05:45 but what is it
00:05:46 okay  now it's sunset look here
00:05:49 you can see the day this is the
00:05:52 daylight hours these are the
00:05:55 sunset waves and these are the night
00:05:57 hours the hours that it's dark no
00:06:06 now it looks it looks a little it's hard it's
00:06:09 hard to see no  I know if there were any
00:06:11 more
00:06:14 rocks if there aren't any rocks
00:06:19 I'm going to do
00:06:21 [Music]
00:06:23 where I'm going to do anything
00:06:30 I'm going to get more wood
00:06:36 to cut down trees with the ax
00:06:40 the ax is very very important in this
00:06:42 game
00:06:43 [Applause]
00:06:48 and another one and still here  Don't run, don't
00:06:53 hurry, I have to make the fire
00:06:55 now, but soon, very soon, it will be night
00:06:58 and I'll have to make the fire.
00:07:02 Here are fruits, fruits of the forest,
00:07:08 very good.
00:07:13 flowers are important  now
00:07:16 you will see why you also have
00:07:20 as they say this as mental strength no
00:07:23 or mental state
00:07:26 if your mental state is bad
00:07:29 yes
00:07:31 although it is this
00:07:35 to this stone this is very important if
00:07:39 they kill me I can revive I can come back to
00:07:42 life here I can come back to life one  once
00:07:44 only once so now if they
00:07:48 kill me I'll have another chance
00:07:53 okay I'm going to get a little closer there
00:07:55 but I'm going to make a fire I
00:07:58 don't have enough for this one I don't have enough
00:08:00 stones I
00:08:01 won't have to make a
00:08:03 temporary fire game
00:08:05 no  He's going to give me to make a game
00:08:08 big fire fire that I can reuse
00:08:10 that I can use several times I'm going to
00:08:14 put myself here in the middle of the forest and the
00:08:16 desert
00:08:20 and here basically we wait for
00:08:23 the night to end
00:08:26 if it takes you away it's too much he tells you or  it is very
00:08:30 dark and it is good it becomes dangerous
00:08:32 then the fire is getting small
00:08:36 small small and you have to throw things on it
00:08:39 you have to have things thrown on it that burn
00:08:42 so you can use logs you
00:08:46 can use it  where are the sticks
00:08:49 to the sticks I guess you can use
00:08:51 the sticks too and you can also throw
00:08:55 in a lot of grass
00:09:01 but hey the fire is the trunk the
00:09:04 trunk is what makes the fire
00:09:06 bigger take advantage of only one and that is that
00:09:09 the fire then  it grows it grows a lot and with
00:09:13 this that's it it won't last until the
00:09:15 morning until the sun rises let's
00:09:19 see if the sun rises now the
00:09:22 nights are short the nights are
00:09:24 quite short but when
00:09:28 summer comes when it's hotter then the
00:09:30 nights go out no it doesn't make sense
00:09:34 no no the nights will get
00:09:37 shorter and a little shorter but then
00:09:40 when winter comes real winter
00:09:42 the nights will be even
00:09:45 longer longer and now
00:09:50 then I want to have a big
00:09:54 fire the big fire  that is interesting and for
00:09:57 that I need rocks I need more rocks
00:10:00 some seeds here the seeds can
00:10:03 be eaten but the most useful function of
00:10:07 the seeds is not to eat it is that
00:10:09 birds come the birds come and the birds come
00:10:13 uncatch you can catch birds
00:10:17 on gold because there is gold here the ground
00:10:20 have you ever found
00:10:22 gold there you are walking down the street and there is
00:10:25 gold no no
00:10:27 it is not very common but there it keeps turning
00:10:29 I don't want to turn the camera
00:10:32 or seeds and more now that  there are some lying
00:10:36 around on the ground
00:10:39 and the flint the flint is good for cutting
00:10:42 look at stones
00:10:45 the stones are they are very useful
00:10:49 now there well now let's see there is
00:10:52 one thing I have seen
00:10:56 this is also a stone no
00:10:59 it is not exactly it can be lowered like
00:11:03 a  cave
00:11:05 inside underneath there is a cave but it is
00:11:08 quite difficult
00:11:12 and this is a teleportation then
00:11:15 teleporting somewhere else on the
00:11:18 map it is interesting it allows you to travel
00:11:21 very fast but it affects mental
00:11:25 health the health of the head affects it and for
00:11:28 now I think not  I'm going to use it
00:11:32 then the rock like this this rock so I
00:11:35 'm going to sting with my pick because that way I can
00:11:40 have a fire big fire
00:11:44 and I haven't eaten
00:11:47 and bees
00:11:50 there is another rock that is staying
00:12:00 well I hope  I'll go at night to make a
00:12:02 big fire
00:12:05 and I'll stay here in this way I think
00:12:08 it's good there's the beak success another beak
00:12:11 I have I have another beak
00:12:19 and well I'm going to take trees and
00:12:22 I'm also going to cut down and install trees it's always
00:12:26 always good it's always good  having
00:12:27 wood in this game is very important and
00:12:31 then in winter in winter they are
00:12:34 difficult in winter it is difficult to
00:12:35 survive or it is enough to survive
00:12:38 because it is cold and there is very little
00:12:41 food very very little food
00:12:44 [Applause]
00:12:48 ok
00:12:51 what am I going to do
00:12:53 [Music]
00:12:55 today
00:12:59 I'm going to see what I have I'm going to see with luck
00:13:03 and something very interesting to build in
00:13:06 this game is a science machine there's
00:13:10 the science machine I already have I can
00:13:13 make the science machine okay I'm going to
00:13:16 do it I'm going to put it here so yes
00:13:19 you can  build some things in
00:13:21 this game like this or like fire, well,
00:13:25 build it and you can form a
00:13:28 bit like a base and it's good that the
00:13:32 machine is the science machine
00:13:35 when I get closer I can  s look I can do
00:13:37 many things I can do other
00:13:40 things
00:13:42 so
00:13:45 I have a spear a spear helps me to
00:13:48 fight and throw that interesting
00:13:51 I need twigs
00:13:53 tools there should be many
00:13:55 more
00:13:56 where you have to find the little
00:13:59 trees the dry little trees
00:14:02 around here
00:14:07 I'm going to mess around without  I turn the camera I'm going
00:14:09 to mess I'm going to find the way
00:14:12 there are no dry trees around here
00:14:15 here
00:14:17 a person
00:14:20 there is another I ca
00:14:25 n't find a wise tree
00:14:30 with that I can do
00:14:32 what can I do to praise
00:14:36 I don't know if I wanted to do the dance
00:14:41 where is my machine  about science I hope
00:14:43 I don't get lost because it's dark
00:14:48 I don't see very well you shouldn't turn off
00:14:51 the lights
00:14:56 I'm getting involved right let's
00:15:02 see
00:15:04 where I am
00:15:08 we're coming here right
00:15:10 in the science machine it's down here
00:15:12 I have to I have to go back to  downstairs
00:15:17 I hope the night doesn't catch me in fear
00:15:22 to attack the bees you have to be
00:15:24 very well prepared this this is
00:15:28 interesting
00:15:29 this I think there may be something like
00:15:34 that  Because there is gold, that's why the stone is
00:15:37 different, it has a different color, let's
00:15:40 see here
00:15:45 where my science machine is,
00:15:55 not here, well, I'm going to make a fire here, you can
00:15:57 do it, because if the night doesn't catch me,
00:16:06 then you can also do
00:16:10 structures,
00:16:15 I don't want to  a structure good so i
00:16:18 wanted the weapon i don't want this to make
00:16:20 a spear a spear to attack enemies i
00:16:23 need a rope here to make a
00:16:26 rope i
00:16:28 need
00:16:30 grass but i can't run anymore the grass
00:16:34 is dark
00:16:36 good so i can i can't make
00:16:40 a torch
00:16:43 with it  torch I have to activate the
00:16:46 list the torch
00:16:48 with a torch I can find
00:16:52 grass
00:16:58 this is a bit of a hassle it's hard to
00:17:01 find not to find things well it
00:17:05 doesn't matter I'm going to I'm going to turn off the torch so
00:17:09 I have so it doesn't wear out because the
00:17:12 torch wears out very quickly
00:17:14 What I do want is
00:17:20 what I do want is to make a field,
00:17:27 a farm, yes, a farm, but to make
00:17:30 a farm I need poop, poop, poop, animal poop,
00:17:37 okay, well, I don't have anything  or to wait until
00:17:40 dawn
00:17:42 I don't have food, that's okay, what I can
00:17:44 do is
00:17:46 not cook
00:17:49 and cook the carrots
00:17:52 and eat carrots
00:17:55 no no no
00:17:56 [Music]
00:17:58 I've also eaten the seeds a little bit
00:18:02 so they can be cooked
00:18:04 [Music]
00:18:08 4
00:18:10 very well
00:18:13 Now more common, they
00:18:15 don't give me much, they don't give me much food, it does
00:18:19 n't relieve my hunger, it doesn't fill, it
00:18:21 doesn't fill much. It
00:18:24 's better to cook with a pot.
00:18:32 the
00:18:34 lord and I'm going to take I'm going to look for grass
00:18:38 and I'm going to look
00:18:41 I'm going to look here here also
00:18:44 kaka about animals there are some animals in
00:18:48 this game that look like cows for
00:18:51 now I haven't found any
00:18:53 that bug is dangerous it's
00:18:56 better not to fight
00:18:59 and see what there is  path here there is a path well
00:19:01 going along the path it goes
00:19:05 faster it runs more
00:19:14 around here let's see what there is
00:19:16 ok little trees make baskets pretty
00:19:20 I need grass a lot of grass
00:19:25 and it needed poop cow poop but I don't know
00:19:28 about cow poop d  where it can be
00:19:36 you have to explore in this game you have to
00:19:38 explore a lot
00:19:40 the world
00:19:42 is not very very big it is not huge but
00:19:46 hey don't see if
00:19:50 the world is big enough
00:19:52 the seeds to have even
00:19:55 a little bit of food
00:20:01 and
00:20:03 would like to do the  pot but the pot
00:20:06 I don't remember how
00:20:08 what is needed to make a pot
00:20:10 I have to turn it over
00:20:12 I have to go back and look look at the
00:20:15 science machineI
00:20:17 don't dress make me
00:20:21 make a garland flower garland
00:20:23 you can do it and it helps you with the
00:20:26 state of mind with the  mental situation
00:20:28 but here there are not many many
00:20:31 flowers
00:20:32 well today I am going to spend
00:20:34 collecting things countersigned stones
00:20:36 collecting flint
00:20:39 collecting seeds
00:20:42 and exploring exploring a little to see if I can
00:20:45 find
00:20:47 cow poop cow poop found cows and then
00:20:51 wait for them to make a cocoa
00:20:57 I think the cows are in an area
00:21:00 like a desert, you don't see that there are
00:21:02 different materials, the ground is made of
00:21:04 different materials and I think the cows
00:21:07 are  in an area that is like a lighthouse,
00:21:10 not a desert, no, it is not a grassy area,
00:21:13 there are many herbs,
00:21:16 so I have to find that area,
00:21:18 that area with which anyone else,
00:21:21 this tree helped us something special,
00:21:24 not pineapples, and that's it,
00:21:27 okay, well, let's continue  exploring
00:21:32 to see what we can find here
00:21:34 [Music
00:21:37 ] here and here there are no weeds here to
00:21:39 rocks I think no
00:21:45 no
00:21:47 I don't know where they are on the map it's on the
00:21:50 map there were weeds
00:21:52 I'm here
00:21:55 there were weeds
00:21:57 today it's pretty low
00:22:00 but well it's pretty  away I
00:22:04 set to explore to see my fire
00:22:08 where is my fire fire up to here
00:22:10 so I'm going to explore a bit around here
00:22:12 near this area so I'm not too
00:22:16 far away it didn't take me too far from my base it took me
00:22:19 too far from my game it
00:22:22 's always a good idea
00:22:28 you can go this way
00:22:30 [Music]
00:22:32 and it's much
00:22:35 clearer it's next to the sea that's why he
00:22:37 hasn't gone there anymore I'm going to go to the
00:22:40 other side
00:22:41 to see what's
00:22:44 around here to see if there's grass next door I
00:22:46 find the cows

00:00:32 I'm going to tell you one  story that
00:00:35 happened a short time ago yes
00:00:38 when this story begins a
00:00:40 year ago a year really that is last year
00:00:44 in 2017 and what happened what happened
00:00:50 before I have to say that
00:00:54 I have been in college for a long time so this
00:00:56 story
00:00:58 watson ten years  before up to ten years
00:01:01 ten years 2007
00:01:03 yes ok ok in 2007 I was studying
00:01:07 at the university exactly and there I had
00:01:11 two friends ok there was
00:01:14 Mariona and I had 22 friends from Salinas one
00:01:20 friend and another friend if we studied together
00:01:23 it was the same degree
00:01:26 yes ok ok when  the university
00:01:29 out each one made their life over and you
00:01:33 like it is each one for their own you
00:01:36 did not continue you did not continue talking on the
00:01:40 phone seeing nothing maybe al
00:01:44 c  After a while we started to follow each other
00:01:46 on social networks after a while
00:01:51 on facebook
00:01:52 instagram instagram but without talking
00:01:56 much and so not talking okay then in
00:02:01 2017 one day

00:02:27 nuria nuria and it was very surprising and you
00:02:31 recognized her if you belong to who  it was and
00:02:34 she didn't even quit anymore
00:02:36 because ten to ten years had passed and
00:02:40 you've seen them on instagram if
00:02:42 they hadn't changed much
00:02:44 Nuria was the same as ten
00:02:47 years ago
00:02:47 and me too and you too then
00:02:54 we were talking and we were talking about the already

00:02:59 talked about our beach friend, yes and
00:03:02 Nuria, and they had already remained
00:03:05 friends, and no, it's not worth it either, and
00:03:09 we were saying what happened to her, since
00:03:11 it happened with we didn't know anything about anything anymore
00:03:15 and well I talked

00:03:31 fuster theater I went to gabi to the theater to see a
00:03:34 play to give her a modern burlesque dance

00:00:58 opportunity to be champion of the
00:01:02 dreaming spanish tournament
00:01:04 very good very good you have already thought a
00:01:07 character is
00:01:10 worth very well look I'm going to  ask me
00:01:14 first okay okay I think it will be more
00:01:19 more interesting okay
00:01:22 4 you want to ask very well my first
00:01:27 question is a fictional character no
00:01:31 it is not a fictional character very well it
00:01:36 is a non-fictional character
00:01:38 so it has to be a real character
00:01:41 a real person is is a person who
00:01:45 is still alive now is a
00:01:48 person who is doing very well is a person
00:01:53 from
00:01:55 america either north america south america
00:01:58 no no
00:02:00 it's not okay it's okay it's a person from europe yes
00:02:07 and it's a person from europe
00:02:10 very well it's a person from the world of
00:02:13 politics or the government no it's not
00:02:18 okay it belongs to some art some
00:02:23 art either literature painting music
00:02:26 movies
00:02:30 okay
00:02:32 this is complicated it
00:02:34 's  it is a woman
00:02:38 it is not a woman a person is an athlete
00:02:44 yes
00:02:47 it is worth it it is a Spanish athlete yes it is
00:02:53 worth having Spanish athletes that
00:02:57 foreigners normally know there
00:03:00 are not many
00:03:03 the most obvious question is the easiest is it is a
00:03:06 footballer it
00:03:10 is not okay then yes there are very few
00:03:13 very few options well I'll go  to ask
00:03:16 directly it's rafa nadal no it's not okay
00:03:22 I'm going to have to think a little more it
00:03:27 's complicated if it's not it's not the most
00:03:31 obvious the most obvious maybe it's correct in
00:03:34 some kind of motor racing I already know about
00:03:37 motorcycles or cars
00:03:41 okay it's alonso
00:03:44 no  no no no oysters more fernando alonso
00:03:49 so if it's not fernando alonso
00:03:52 so there are several options well I'm going to
00:03:56 clarify the first one he's a
00:03:59 car racing
00:04:02 driver okay he's a formula 1
00:04:06 e driver  Indeed, he is a Formula 1 driver,
00:04:09 okay, let
00:04:12 's see, I don't know, I know a lot
00:04:16 about Formula One drivers, it's Carlos
00:04:21 Sainz Jr.
00:04:26 Sainz Jr. Oysters, if you've looked for one that is
00:04:30 n't very well known, luckily I knew it
00:04:33 because I only know these Spanish Formula One drivers.
00:04:36 two
00:04:41 well we are surprised I am surprised that
00:04:45 you know Carlos Sainz and it is that I
00:04:48 like Formula 1 so well I know him I
00:04:51 said he is Spanish so okay mind Pablo
00:04:54 knows him very well very very well
00:05:00 how many questions were 16 well I have
00:05:04 super six time I know if they have not been  very
00:05:07 few I think you have there is room
00:05:10 to beat
00:05:12 me good luck I hope you do well and
00:05:16 whenever you want you can start
00:05:19 good
00:05:21 in the character is a real person
00:05:26 no is not a real person well your
00:05:30 character is a woman is not a woman
00:05:34 ok you  character is a
00:05:39 human if it is a character that represents
00:05:44 even a
00:05:46 perfect human then well a
00:05:49 fictional human man your character is animated if it is
00:05:54 a cartoon character  animated very
00:05:57 well your character is for children
00:06:03 very well so we have a character
00:06:07 for children who is a man who is a
00:06:10 human this character is from disney no he
00:06:15 is not a character from disney and
00:06:17 well
00:06:19 many options have already been eliminated yes
00:06:23 it is also where I don't know what  ask ha
00:06:26 ha
00:06:31 your character appears in movies I
00:06:36 would say that if I think there is a
00:06:38 movie ok your character
00:06:44 your character
00:06:46 who will it be I
00:06:49 stopped thinking
00:06:51 your character
00:06:54 originally speaks English
00:06:58 yes yes yes he speaks English
00:07:00 this also removes many options from
00:07:03 Japanese animes and such
00:07:06 I don't know  So
00:07:10 I wasn't going to know. Well, your character
00:07:16 told me that it's a drawing of the
00:07:19 cartoon
00:07:20 and that it's for children. If your character is
00:07:25 from Nickelodeon, Nickelodeon is a
00:07:29 television network. I don't know if you asked me if they
00:07:33 put it on that television network.
00:07:37 I know in Spain we don't have liquidity
00:07:40 or the rest and I have no idea
00:07:44 ok
00:07:47 Pablo it's very difficult it's pain your
00:07:50 character
00:07:54 is not an adult he's not an adult yet
00:08:00 Well, you still have seven questions left
00:08:03 to tie with me, yes, but
00:08:07 I have to think about them carefully. Let me think about my
00:08:10 strategy. Does your character have supernatural powers? It
00:08:13 's a good, good
00:08:17 question because many
00:08:19 comic book characters are superheroes, no, if not, he doesn't have
00:08:24 superpowers. Well, your character has
00:08:27 one  series dedicated to him a series
00:08:32 dedicated a series dedicated to you can
00:08:36 ask the question in another way your
00:08:38 character appears in a
00:08:42 television series set cc well
00:08:48 the television series is what makes
00:08:53 your character famous is it the most
00:08:56 important thing or your character originally
00:09:00 comes  from another side it
00:09:02 originally comes from another side ok it
00:09:05 comes from the literature of novels you
00:09:09 mean if it's not a character
00:09:13 originally from a novel you killed me
00:09:17 well and you told me that a movie doesn't
00:09:21 mean maybe it appears in a
00:09:23 movie but it's not at night  It is not
00:09:26 from a movie it is not the best
00:09:29 known
00:09:30 ok well a character that is not
00:09:32 from a movie is not
00:09:35 original  Inary of a series does not originate
00:09:38 from literature but it comes from
00:09:41 somewhere
00:09:43 if the majority of cartoon
00:09:45 characters originate from this medium in
00:09:49 which this character originates, that's why in
00:09:51 good many many would say your character
00:09:56 does some sport
00:09:59 [Music  ]
00:10:00 no that I know of no he is not known for
00:10:03 doing any sports how many questions
00:10:05 does he say you are at 14 you have 2 left to
00:10:11 tie
00:10:12 but that
00:10:15 urban legend cartoon characters originate
00:10:19 and not many originate from the world
00:10:23 of than the real world  You don't think
00:10:27 superheroes i tabal for example ok but
00:10:30 you told me that it doesn't have powers no no it doesn't
00:10:33 have powers just that it originates from the
00:10:36 same medium well in your character it's
00:10:40 like I don't know what to ask
00:10:44 your character is
00:10:46 related to the world of
00:10:48 superheroes no no  no it's not a
00:10:51 supporting character of a superhero it's not robyn
00:10:57 ok last question to tie if you can't
00:11:03 and now we're going to deduce who the
00:11:05 character is
00:11:12 I'm not going to give you one anymore  The biggest clue is worth
00:11:15 what a character originating from
00:11:19 the
00:11:20 world of comics is a comic I don't read
00:11:23 comics
00:11:26 I don't know if I have read this comic
00:11:28 specifically but it is well known
00:11:30 yes but if I can't tell you about the next clue
00:11:34 because  yes no
00:11:36 but for this
00:11:41 the best known the best known I think it
00:11:44 's the animated series and it's a human person
00:11:51 xp
00:11:55 good for I have to risk and
00:11:57 I can't think of anything so give me a second
00:11:59 I think of something I don't know about mortí de
00:12:03 ricky  Not for you,
00:12:07 but well, in the
00:12:11 sense that he's a normal child, you don't want
00:12:15 me to tell you the solution, he doesn't want to go on,
00:12:18 and I doubt you know, I think
00:12:21 I don't know him, I don't know, let's see who he is
00:12:25 see, I'll give you a clue, okay, ok,
00:12:29 his best friend is a dog, I don't know,
00:12:34 a dog
00:12:36 with values, you don't have a best
00:12:39 friend,
00:12:40 a series for children,
00:12:46 a Disney series
00:12:49 about a dog that was very bad, that's why it
00:12:52 was called are the  blogger dog
00:12:56 that's what I'm thinking about no it doesn't occur to me
00:12:59 ok it's a dog a very famous comic book dog
00:13:02 I don't know
00:13:08 it's not a rat
00:13:12 [Laughter]
00:13:16 a mouse mouse
00:13:18 no no I don't know who doesn't know it's a dog
00:13:25 named it's cloud
00:13:27 a
00:13:28 [Music]
00:13:30 you don't know the boy's name no
00:13:34 seriously yes the  proud 'charlie brown'
00:13:37 I didn't know I swear I didn't if you don't know
00:13:42 the name of charlie brown never 10
00:13:45 knots she didn't know that if she had a
00:13:48 million
00:13:50 that she had a child
00:13:54 ok feel good in mind even if it's the
00:13:56 image of the child she would recognize it if she did
00:13:59 You would have, I don't know who he is, send a
00:14:02 photo to look for him and well, I'm not
00:14:05 thinking what to do if I didn't
00:14:08 know someone who didn't know him,
00:14:13 well, we don't have to do another one,
00:14:17 we have to try another character if I
00:14:20 didn't know him,
00:14:21 well,
00:14:27 I think so  yes I think so
00:14:30 we will leave it in the video because that way
00:14:32 people can also play with you
00:14:34 try to guess well
00:14:36 and they will all be yelling you like
00:14:39 'charlie brown' a lot of pounds yelling
00:14:41 at someone
00:14:44 the guardian is going to kill me in the
00:14:47 comments and sorry guys you  I swear I
00:14:50 didn't know him because I think a bit to see
00:14:53 what the next character is and
00:14:56 we start time in it later well
00:14:59 Agustina I already thought of another
00:15:02 character and now it's up to you again to
00:15:05 try to guess it to see if you know this one let's
00:15:09 see  Yes, this time we have better luck.
00:15:13 Well, let's start with the questions and
00:15:18 it's a real character.
00:15:43 perfect native
00:15:45 is a woman who is alive now no she
00:15:49 was not well she
00:15:52 is european cee is a european woman
00:15:57 very well she is a woman from the world of
00:16:00 politics i
00:16:03 guess you could you could say
00:16:06 so
00:16:07 those answers i
00:16:09 guess
00:16:11 well you guess not absolutely not
00:16:15 exactly ok not exactly  she is
00:16:20 a woman who speaks english she does not speak
00:16:24 english or not as a native language
00:16:27 well
00:16:32 one
00:16:34 not
00:16:36 strong
00:16:39 an athlete an athlete no
00:16:44 no she was not an athlete
00:16:46 ok but it was not political and i
00:16:50 hope she is  I don't know if you meet this woman,
00:16:54 you scare me,
00:16:57 well, let's see, she's a
00:17:02 scientist,
00:17:04 no, she wasn't a scientist, well, she was a
00:17:09 woman related to religion,
00:17:13 no, she's not related to
00:17:16 religion, she wasn't at Bonhams or anything
00:17:19 like that,
00:17:20 she was
00:17:21 Anglo-French,
00:17:23 yes.  spoke french
00:17:27 joan of arc i
00:17:34 knew her
00:17:37 but i think most people
00:17:40 know her yes
00:17:42 well well very well like that because you were
00:17:47 asking about jobs and i thought look
00:17:51 'joan of arc' had a job that
00:17:53 was not usual for women so
00:17:56 maybe it's hard for her  to find it but not to
00:18:00 the one who knew that she was French already on
00:18:03 the way out otherwise I began to think
00:18:06 well who could it be I don't know what woman
00:18:10 who is not a politician but intervened in
00:18:13 politics and the only one I thought was one
00:18:17 will be Juana  from arcos then I asked you do you
00:18:19 speak French and when you
00:18:22 told me yes I said it had to be her and
00:18:25 if not I don't know I wouldn't know what else to say

045,"00:00:00 I really like
00:00:06 cats I like dogs obviously
00:00:10 yes the idea but no no no no cats
00:00:14 are better than dogs
00:00:18 whatever you say
00:00:21 today we are going to have a debate
00:00:26 I think dogs are better
00:00:29 obviously like everyone else  world
00:00:33 and he believes that the Gauls are the reasons
00:00:38 [Music]
00:00:43 or the time, well, if I am going to say why,
00:00:50 because a cat is better and not
00:00:55 you, obviously I am going to say why
00:00:59 dogs are superior because they are better
00:01:03 as pets, well,
00:01:06 look  cats cats are very
00:01:12 good pets very good pets of
00:01:16 course because they know
00:01:21 where they have to pee
00:01:24 where they have to poop they are not very
00:01:29 smart they are very very very clean they are very
00:01:33 clean this is true
00:01:37 cats
00:01:38 are clean  but you said that cats
00:01:42 are good pets yes well I
00:01:45 think animals bathroom I think cats are
00:01:48 good roommates they are more good
00:01:51 roommates because cats
00:01:54 are not pets in a flat you live  in an apartment
00:01:58 is your partner of course someone who lives
00:02:02 with you to live together in the
00:02:05 exact same apartment you are together
00:02:11 but you are not friends cats do not
00:02:15 like you for cats you are the
00:02:19 service you are a tool you are a
00:02:22 tool the butler the eldest of
00:02:24 Jerez,
00:02:25 on the other hand, for a dog, you are everyone,
00:02:28 tough, you are everything, everything, you are his
00:02:31 exact best friend. When you arrive, you
00:02:34 arrive home, I was waiting for the one you have
00:02:37 come, and of course I don't have friends. I
00:02:41 need an isolated dog for people
00:02:43 like Adrià Frutero who have  friends of
00:02:45 course it is better than people also if
00:02:53 you can play with a dog a cat
00:02:56 you try to play with a cat a cat
00:03:00 and it will not catch no because it does not bring a
00:03:06 stick cat scratches you they give you years but with
00:03:10 its of this with its paws  spider if it
00:03:13 has nails it has
00:03:16 nails I like cats I really like to
00:03:20 caress cats but it's true that cats like to be caressed
00:03:27 but not anymore
00:03:29 [Laughter]
00:03:34 yes but I like cats
00:03:39 because  They don't fill you with drool,
00:03:44 you don't have parents but these are the clothes
00:03:47 for the face and also they don't smell bad this
00:03:51 is true the others smell bad and I
00:03:55 like dog drool the smell of dog
00:03:58 you like me  I like it
00:04:08 I love it but if you have to come
00:04:12 come with me
00:04:13 to my uncle's house your uncle has many
00:04:16 dogs and uncle my aunt
00:04:18 my father's sister only has one dog
00:04:21 but it is a dog that weighs
00:04:26 about five dogs do you know what breed it is what
00:04:30 kind of  A dog is yes it is a San Bernardo
00:04:33 oysters in San Bernardo I am very big it is
00:04:36 big very woman and when she walks she pushes
00:04:41 everything but she doesn't know she doesn't know where she's going to
00:04:45 push
00:04:50 but I don't like the one with the
00:04:54 dog branch and a  the dog is a lot of
00:04:58 responsibility it is a lot of work this is
00:05:02 true every day every day you have to
00:05:04 take him for a walk of course you have to
00:05:07 walk the dog how many times a day 23 2
00:05:10 or 3 I know if it is a lot a lot of work it is a
00:05:14 lot of work yes especially if you don't have
00:05:16 a  very large garden of course if you live in
00:05:19 a house it is  s in a house not with a
00:05:23 garden or trees and flowers
00:05:26 if you can have the dog the dog goes out and
00:05:28 runs and walks he walks he only
00:05:32 moves but with cats they have a
00:05:36 problem because there are many
00:05:38 people who are allergic to cats  high, that is to
00:05:41 say, if there is a cat in the house, they do not
00:05:45 sneeze because of the ailment, so
00:05:48 the friends who do not want to come to
00:05:50 your house do not come with the dogs,
00:05:52 except for the seat, because there are people who are
00:05:54 afraid of dogs, but at least  People
00:05:56 have allergies
00:05:58 to me I like cats I like to
00:06:01 caress them but I have an allergy
00:06:05 I also have an allergy to cats yes if
00:06:08 I touch a cat or touch
00:06:12 a chair or clothes it will be and hair to
00:06:16 cat hair and then I touched my face it itches
00:06:21 I sneeze
00:06:23 and my eyes itch my nose itches it
00:06:27 does this so maybe I could take
00:06:32 some medicine some pills or something
00:06:34 possible
00:06:35 and I also like dogs dogs too
00:06:38 but yes it is true that in
00:06:41 a flat it is easier for a cat it is not
00:06:45 even the cat  have like a baby and you
00:06:49 have a cat
00:06:50 I don't have I don't have any
00:06:53 pets, you wouldn't like to have a dog or
00:06:56 a cat and I would have to try taking
00:07:02 a splinter so I don't have allergies
00:07:05 but if I didn't have an allergy
00:07:08 I don't know I don't know  I know but but cats
00:07:12 are better cats I like that they
00:07:20 have a lot of agility they can jump
00:07:24 up the shelves it was Flores
00:07:28 Díaz they strip you off the shelves the
00:07:31 shelves go up here if you have
00:07:34 here I don't know books or
00:07:37 whatever sometimes yes a  Sometimes they throw
00:07:40 things away
00:07:41 but they are very, very funny, they are
00:07:45 thanks or they are
00:07:50 cute, I like them but I need to play
00:07:54 with them, it's a good glove to be able to
00:07:58 grab
00:08:01 them like a cat, a cat is impossible,
00:08:03 and cats also have
00:08:06 very different personalities  Yes, there are
00:08:09 cats that are very friendly that you get
00:08:13 home and they come, they come, they fall asleep, they fall
00:08:16 asleep here or they caress you,
00:08:30 yes, I really like dogs a
00:08:34 lot, but neither do small dogs.
00:08:36 I like them I think it's my thing
00:08:38 small problems I think if you have
00:08:40 a very big cat I think I would like to
00:08:43 make a cat or a big cat from Egypt
00:08:46 like a tiger a tiger
00:08:50 I would like to be with that if you could
00:08:54 play of course
00:08:57 very well I think  We haven't come to a
00:09:01 conclusion.
00:09:02 I still like dogs and
00:09:06 cats. The bosses are always better. Be
00:09:08 good, what can we do? They have 77
00:09:11 lives, many lives. Seven
00:09:15 lives, seven in Spain, do
00:09:18 n't die.  the
00:09:20 dogs the dogs have 2
00:09:28 [Laughs]
00:09:34 that's why cats are 7 times better
00:09:39 than dogs it's true if they've won
00:09:42 right I can't counter this
00:09:44 argument it's the best the best argument that's it
00:09:47 there's nothing to say it's true
00:09:49 from now on just me  They like cats
00:09:51 well I have convinced him a good one
00:09:55 well old thanks for listening to
00:09:58 our other debate and thanks to you for
00:10:01 coming and discussing the name enchanted
00:10:05 see you another day and to you who like it
00:10:08 better  you like dogs or cats better
00:10:12 tell us in the comments below go to the
00:10:16 back
00:10:30 bye I like them it's not
00:10:36 for me I like it

073,"00:00:00 Today I am going to explain a
00:00:04 reason why I think it is very
00:00:08 important to listen, listen and read a
00:00:10 lot, but it is not that important, it is
00:00:15 not really necessary to practice speaking a lot
00:00:19 or practice writing a lot
00:00:24 [Music]
00:00:26 ah
00:00:28 hello, well, a reason, a reason  among
00:00:34 other reasons there are many reasons
00:00:37 why I believe this but one reason why I
00:00:40 think it is not so important to practice
00:00:44 speaking why it is very important to
00:00:48 listen listen a lot and read a lot
00:00:52 is because during my life I have met
00:00:55 certain people I have met people
00:00:59 who  they talked a lot they spoke a lot in a
00:01:03 language very different from theirs they knew how to
00:01:06 talk a lot at least it seemed like they
00:01:10 knew how to talk a lot they talked fast and
00:01:13 separated us but when someone
00:01:17 answered them when someone said something they
00:01:20 didn't understand they didn't understand what they
00:01:24 had been told
00:01:29 this happened to me  with japanese when i
00:01:32 was in japan i lived in kyoto i
00:01:35 was in a city called kyoto
00:01:38 and i met people who studied
00:01:41 japanese  I studied Japanese at the
00:01:43 university and I remember certain
00:01:46 people who spoke a lot
00:01:49 but then when a Japanese person
00:01:53 spoke to them or answered them they
00:01:56 didn't understand they didn't understand a lot they didn't understand a
00:02:00 lot they
00:02:00 understood quite a bit and I was
00:02:04 surprised
00:02:07 this is one reason why I think
00:02:11 The input is important It is important to
00:02:13 listen It is important to be able to understand a
00:02:16 lot
00:02:18 and that is one reason why I think that if
00:02:21 we understand a lot about speaking, speaking
00:02:25 comes naturally no
00:02:30 and this is the reason I have met people
00:02:33 who talk a lot but understand little but
00:02:38 never never  I have met a person who
00:02:42 understands a lot of Japanese
00:02:45 but they are not going to speak they are not going to speak
00:02:48 at a level at a similar level
00:02:52 and this I think is more obvious it is
00:02:56 more common with languages ​​that are very
00:02:58 different
00:02:59 okay of course me right now me
00:03:03 I don't speak any Italian I don't know how to speak
00:03:05 Italian but I understand a lot
00:03:08 because Italian is very similar to Spanish it
00:03:11 's very similar to Catalan too and  It is
00:03:14 very similar to languages ​​that I know
00:03:17 well and therefore also if I start to
00:03:21 learn Italian
00:03:23 I will surely be able to understand much more than
00:03:26 what I speak.
00:03:30 This is not in the case of languages ​​that are
00:03:33 very different from Japanese to Chinese to
00:03:37 Arabic for us.  They are very different,
00:03:42 most of the words we have to
00:03:44 learn are new to us, well,
00:03:49 in these languages, in Chinese, in
00:03:52 Japanese, in Thai, for example,
00:03:54 I have never met a person who does not
00:03:58 understand, for example, does not understand
00:04:02 that they understand that they do understand, for
00:04:04 example  the television understands the
00:04:06 series or the movies but it is not going to
00:04:09 speak it cannot speak it cannot speak
00:04:11 well or it cannot communicate speaking
00:04:14 so for me automatically if in
00:04:18 a language I reach a level it reached a
00:04:21 point of understanding to understand
00:04:23 television to understand  the movies that
00:04:26 means that either speaking is
00:04:29 speaking well even if you haven't practiced
00:04:31 because I simply don't know of any
00:04:34 examples of people who learn  they understand
00:04:37 a different language a totally
00:04:40 different language and they understand everything but they
00:04:44 can't speak
00:04:47 that and also the fact that listening
00:04:52 listening and reading I think it's the
00:04:55 fastest way to understand to
00:04:58 understand more I can't imagine I
00:05:02 don't think it's possible that speaking
00:05:04 practicing speaking let's understand more let's
00:05:07 understand more than we understood
00:05:09 before therefore I continue I'm
00:05:13 convinced that listening and reading
00:05:20 is enough it's enough to get
00:05:23 to speaking it's not necessary it's not necessary to
00:05:25 practice speaking obviously speaking
00:05:29 is a good thing it's a goal  to which
00:05:33 we want to reach and when our level
00:05:35 is high enough I think that
00:05:38 speaking is good is something that helps us to
00:05:42 belong more to the society to the
00:05:45 culture in which we are than the one in which
00:05:49 we are learning the language
00:05:51 and also to speak as someone commented
00:05:54 in the  comments recently to talk is
00:05:57 a very good way to get input
00:06:00 to get other people
00:06:02 to talk to us and  to be able to listen to be able to
00:06:05 listen even more
00:06:08 but I don't think that simply speaking
00:06:11 speaking in itself helps us to understand
00:06:15 more or helps us to have a higher general
00:06:20 level in the language
00:06:24 so
00:06:26 at a certain point speaking is
00:06:30 necessary to finish pronouncing well
00:06:35 To finish saying really do the
00:06:38 coordination coordinate the muscles to be
00:06:41 able to use the muscles of the mouth to be able to
00:06:44 move move the mouth to have a
00:06:48 good pronunciation surely you have to
00:06:51 practice you have to practice a little
00:06:54 but I think that this practice is a
00:06:58 practice that is very fast they are  a
00:07:00 few hours is a few hours a short time
00:07:04 in total what you have to practice
00:07:07 pronouncing and in the end it is not a
00:07:12 practice that takes many many hours
00:07:14 it is not a practice like what many
00:07:18 people imagine I think they
00:07:20 think that you have to practice speaking for
00:07:22 tens and dozens of hours or hundreds of
00:07:25 hours and I think it's not necessary and one
00:07:29 reason one of the reasons is what I
00:07:32 'm telling you that I've met people who can
00:07:36 talk talk a lot talk very fast
00:07:38 but then they don't understand what they are told
00:07:41 but I have not known the opposite case that
00:07:45 in a very different language a person
00:07:48 can understand understand a lot but can't
00:07:51 speak I know that the
00:07:55 words don't come out they can't communicate ok and
00:07:58 Well, tell me, tell me what
00:08:01 you think in the comments below, if you
00:08:04 think I'm right or if you think
00:08:06 I'm not, I'm stupid, okay,
00:08:10 come on, I'll climb
",3
241,"00:00:00 what a very sudden and very unexpected news
00:00:06 [Music] well
00:00:11 yes the queen of the united kingdom has died
00:00:16 isabel second rest in peace and
00:00:20 her son carlos third has become king
00:00:23 and if we call them isabel and
00:00:27 carlos although they are not their
00:00:30 original names in English because formerly
00:00:33 The names of important people were translated
00:00:38 now, that's not why
00:00:41 Carlos's children are called William and Henri, the
00:00:44 same as in English, not in English.
00:00:48 Queen Isabel the
00:00:51 first calls her
00:00:54 Isabella Isabella they call her Isabella but
00:00:56 Elizabeth we call her Isabel I don't know why Isabella
00:00:59 They didn't call her Elizabeth but well but
00:01:03 in English that in English was the same as
00:01:05 Isabel they called her Isabella but now
00:01:09 not now the king of Spain is Felipe it's not
00:01:13 Phillip in English so Isabel at
00:01:17 the time of her death was the monarch
00:01:19 the king or queen  longest-
00:01:24 reigning king or queen longest-reigning living king or queen
00:01:27 had already reigned for 70 years
00:01:31 over 70 years
00:01:34 and had been the
00:01:38 longest-reigning monarch since
00:01:40 2016 since  e in 2016 the king of
00:01:46 thailand died who at that time
00:01:49 had also been reigning in thailand for seven years
00:01:52 had been 70 years but in total he spent
00:01:55 less time less days than isabel the
00:01:59 second and the 70 years of reign 70 years
00:02:04 and peak of the reign of isabel the second is
00:02:07 the  The second longest reign in
00:02:11 human history that we know of is the
00:02:15 second after King Louis 14 of
00:02:18 France and if it seems to the people of
00:02:22 our generation that
00:02:26 Queen Elizabeth is eternal, not because for
00:02:29 us she has been queen all our lives
00:02:32 when we  we were born
00:02:35 queen isabel she was already an old woman she
00:02:38 was already a granny and she has been a
00:02:43 granny all my life so
00:02:46 we already knew that this had to happen
00:02:49 we already knew that sooner or later the queen
00:02:52 had to die but even so it has been very
00:02:55 sudden it has been very  suddenly because we
00:03:00 did not know that the queen was ill
00:03:03 we did not know that she was bad and well her
00:03:06 death has triggered
00:03:10 operation london bridge
00:03:13 operation london london br  idge sounds a
00:03:16 bit like the name of a 007 movie
00:03:19 but in truth it is something sadder, it
00:03:23 simply refers to the protocol of the
00:03:27 funeral and all the preparations and
00:03:30 activities of the funeral of mourning everything
00:03:33 related to the death of queen
00:03:37 isabel that's good as  Any
00:03:39 protocol from the royal house
00:03:42 is all very detailed, very specific,
00:03:45 the steps that have to be followed,
00:03:48 who has to say, and well, the
00:03:52 queen seems to have died peacefully, at
00:03:55 least the royal house has announced that the
00:03:57 queen died peacefully, she died in the
00:04:00 castle in  scotland where he goes on
00:04:04 summer vacation where he rests
00:04:06 during the summer and well the role of the
00:04:09 queen and now of the king is purely
00:04:13 symbolic it is a symbol although
00:04:15 technically he is the head of state but it
00:04:18 is a role above all symbolic and the
00:04:21 queen did not give her  Opinion on politics
00:04:24 on social issues is a bit of a
00:04:27 taboo it's something you're not supposed
00:04:30 to do and in your lifetime it seems
00:04:34 that most Britons l  the majority
00:04:36 of citizens of the united kingdom-
00:04:40 supported her were in favor of her had
00:04:43 a very high approval rating including
00:04:48 australia that in australia in
00:04:52 1999 they voted in a referendum and they
00:04:56 chose that australia not be a
00:04:59 republic they chose to continue having
00:05:02 the queen although there have been  periods
00:05:06 in which the popularity of the queen or the
00:05:08 approval of the queen has decreased
00:05:11 mainly due to problems with her children
00:05:15 problems with the divorces of her children
00:05:18 with the death of lady di not
00:05:21 princess diana and well then there has been
00:05:24 criticism without criticism  general of the
00:05:28 monarchy but this is something normal
00:05:32 today in a modern society it is normal
00:05:35 for the monarchy to be considered something
00:05:38 outdated something of the past but even
00:05:41 so Queen Elizabeth had more
00:05:44 approval than the monarchy
00:05:47 and it is true that during her
00:05:50 reign  queen isabel made some
00:05:54 changes to modernize the royal house
00:05:57 to modernize the royal family they
00:06:01 opened their communications with the press
00:06:04 more  they started to pay taxes and for
00:06:08 example they opened buckingham palace
00:06:11 for tourists so that people
00:06:14 could visit it so if
00:06:17 from now on the king is charles the third charles the
00:06:20 third, 73 years old, has begun to reign
00:06:25 at the age of 73, which technically already in the
00:06:29 At the time the queen died, she has
00:06:31 become king but she has not yet performed
00:06:34 the coronation ceremony,
00:06:37 the king's coronation will take place later and he will reign
00:06:41 with his wife with the queen consort
00:06:44 Camila and well, it is news, I have

00:00:05 Hello Marce Pablo What a pleasure finally
00:00:09 Yes yes it had been a long time since we
00:00:13 recorded a video together for a long
00:00:15 time I think you had me a bit
00:00:18 abandoned well
00:00:23 welcome to the tournament to this tournament
00:00:27 to this competition to guess the
00:00:30 character let's see who is the
00:00:33 champion of 8 people we are eight
00:00:36 people who are playing in this
00:00:39 tournament
00:00:40 I love it Because I am also super
00:00:43 competitive so I am going to give everything
00:00:47 to win
00:00:50 Okay it scares me now
00:00:54 what happens is that I think you have never
00:00:58 played this game right never  no
00:01:02 But well, I've already explained a little
00:01:07 how to play
00:01:08 basically each of us have
00:01:12 to think of a character or a person
00:01:15 and we have to ask questions to see
00:01:19 who can guess
00:01:23 the other person's character with fewer questions
00:01:25 by asking fewer questions then  This
00:01:29 game is sometimes called the game
00:01:32 of 20 questions because you have a limit
00:01:36 of 20 questions to guess the
00:01:38 character but how are we going to play today?  or
00:01:42 there is no limit of questions We
00:01:44 are only going to see which of the two wins and
00:01:48 can guess it with fewer questions
00:01:51 then the last question When you
00:01:54 ask is this character that
00:01:57 will also count as a question and if we think
00:02:02 of a character that the other person does not
00:02:04 know So  we have to
00:02:08 play again we have to think about another
00:02:10 character and play again ok ready
00:02:13 ok then Marce you want to start your
00:02:16 guessing
00:02:19 well I'll start if you want
00:02:21 yes ok come on
00:02:26 is female this character is not not
00:02:30 feminine is not is not a woman
00:02:32 is fiction
00:02:35 No no  he is a fictional character he is a
00:02:38 real character in real life
00:02:42 ok he is not female in real life he is
00:02:46 in politics
00:02:47 no he is not a political character not from the
00:02:51 government he is not an actor he is an actor well
00:02:58 at least being an actor is not his job
00:03:01 It's not what people
00:03:04 know him for. I'm not sure if he's done
00:03:06 any movies or been in any
00:03:08 movies.
00:03:11 Is he American? Technically he's from the United States.
00:03:16 Yes, but the  the way
00:03:19 people think no I don't know I don't know
00:03:24 normally understood as from the United States
00:03:27 [Music]
00:03:29 I don't know if I'm confusing you more
00:03:31 let's say no it's not from the United States
00:03:34 Although technically yes it would
00:03:36 be Oh how difficult it is a comedian it is not a
00:03:42 comedian  No, he is not, he is not a comedian, he is
00:03:45 known worldwide,
00:03:50 he is known, well, many people around
00:03:53 the world know him, that is, he is not an actor, he is a man,
00:03:57 he is not a comedian, he is not a politician, he is a
00:04:03 person, that is, he is a
00:04:06 human being,
00:04:09 yes, yes, he is human, he is an athlete, he is not
00:04:14 a  famous dog
00:04:17 No he's not sporty
00:04:20 the singer yes I think you're very very
00:04:25 close you're getting close he
00:04:27 's young Now no now you couldn't
00:04:31 say he's young
00:04:32 Justin Bieber is Justin Bieber
00:04:38 I'd say Justin Bieber Yes yes he's
00:04:41 young he
00:04:42 sings pop yes yes
00:04:45 oh  I don't know
00:04:50 I'm terrible with the names of the
00:04:52 singers Hahaha
00:05:02 [Music]
00:05:08 I'll give you a clue okay you should
00:05:13 know It's important to know in what language
00:05:16 this person
00:05:19 sings he sings in English he
00:05:22 doesn't sing in Spanish
00:05:25 yes so much in Spanish
00:05:27 pop singer in Spanish is Ricky
00:05:31 Martin
00:05:34 yes
00:05:36 and I was saying but of course
00:05:39 and like the United States came to my mind at once
00:05:42 Puerto Rico is
00:05:46 the United States of course But that
00:05:48 confused me but yes I already
00:05:52 imagined it but in the  the moment you found out
00:05:55 that it was that he sang in Spanish
00:05:57 right away
00:06:01 gods before
00:06:03 Oh how many questions I asked 30 around and
00:06:07 you went to 17
00:06:10 at least
00:06:12 very well very well
00:06:17 And it's because I'm so bad with
00:06:19 names I already said but Ricky Martin is
00:06:22 not very  famous Yes, that's fine, what
00:06:27 have you thought about a character? No, yes,
00:06:31 I'll start asking
00:06:34 this character, is she a woman, is she female? Okay, she
00:06:38 's a fictional character, she
00:06:42 's a fictional character, she's not a
00:06:44 real
00:06:47 character, she's a cartoon character, yes,
00:06:51 I think so.  you
00:06:55 're going to win me a cartoon
00:06:57 character maybe it seems
00:07:00 to me that I'm already getting
00:07:03 pretty close to the correct answer he was from he
00:07:10 appeared in a cartoon from
00:07:12 when you were little yes ok well it
00:07:19 was u  a western cartoon let's say
00:07:24 from Europe or America
00:07:28 ok Yes to your question if it is from yes what
00:07:34 else can I ask I have several ideas
00:07:36 of various ways where I can
00:07:39 ask
00:07:40 is a human woman
00:07:43 [Music]
00:07:44 [Laughs]
00:07:51 one that is a very big clue  It is a
00:07:54 human female part
00:07:56 that I answer yes or no I don't know yes sometimes it
00:08:00 is not it is not very clear or it is better
00:08:03 than just friends
00:08:06 okay it is
00:08:09 a science fiction drawings well it
00:08:12 is fiction yes futuristic science fiction
00:08:15 with technology they
00:08:20 are not drawings  fantasy
00:08:25 no it's not fantasy or science fiction
00:08:29 but she's half woman Ah ok ok
00:08:33 ok ok ok I know
00:08:36 The Little Mermaid yes
00:08:40 well I think Ariel not from Disney
00:08:46 well it was very easy
00:08:49 from Andersen's tales I think it's
00:08:52 something like that No not really no  I'm sure if there
00:08:55 is an original story
00:08:59 but the original one was called Marina, it
00:09:04 's the original story and she was dying
00:09:08 because she didn't have The Prince's Kiss and
00:09:12 she turned into foam, that's where they released the
00:09:16 Little Mermaid version of Di  sney, which is
00:09:20 less Tragic, which is less Tragic, more
00:09:23 pink, more romantic, and with a happy ending.
00:09:26 Yes, very well, how many did you guess with?
00:09:30 I'm sorry to tell you that I guessed with 9.
00:09:45 I'll try to win this tournament, okay No, but

00:01:40 exactly I am not going to draw
00:01:43 and with  with people on excursions  or
00:01:46 excursion
00:01:49 riddle and adrià you like you like the
00:01:53 mountains and they always have always been
00:01:55 from the mountains but in the mountains there are many
00:01:57 bugs there are mosquitoes there is not

00:02:28 since I was little always the same
00:02:33 otherwise it doesn't itch it itches yesterday it's a small
00:02:38 problem but it's not a serious problem it
00:02:40 really works for us it's a lot of program you're
00:02:43 there in the middle of nature because
00:02:46 because you like it  I like it because you know me,
00:02:49 you already know from other debates that
00:02:52 I'm a bit antisocial that I
00:02:56 like Adriano no he doesn't like the people

00:03:12 go to the mountains and walk and
00:03:14 around you there is no one you can't see
00:03:17 anyone there are mosquitoes

212,"00:00:00 you often ask me this question you
00:00:03 say pablo i understand you very well i
00:00:06 understand dreaming spanish videos
00:00:09 very well but in real life when i
00:00:11 hear people or watch series or watch
00:00:14 movies they speak too fast i don't
00:00:17 understand because they speak too fast
00:00:20 what can i do to stop  understand Spanish
00:00:24 when it is spoken quickly when it is
00:00:27 spoken very quickly today I am going to explain
00:00:30 to you what you need to know everything
00:00:33 you need to know to understand
00:00:35 Spanish quickly
00:00:39 [Music]
00:00:42 hello well yes let me tell
00:00:47 you and give you a spoiler and  say tell you what
00:00:51 the problem is the problem is not that they
00:00:54 are speaking too fast and
00:00:58 you don't have to do anything special to
00:01:00 get used to understanding Spanish
00:01:03 fast and it is not even necessary to
00:01:06 practice listening to Spanish fast to be
00:01:10 able to understand Spanish fast today I am going
00:01:13 to explain the  reasons why perhaps
00:01:16 you do not understand when they speak to you quickly and
00:01:19 I am going to explain what to do to
00:01:22 solve each of these things that
00:01:24 already  I can say that the solution is the
00:01:27 same the solution if you have seen several
00:01:31 of these videos you will already know that the
00:01:33 solution is always the same so
00:01:37 one reason why it may be that
00:01:40 when you hear someone speaking more
00:01:43 slowly you understand it you understand it well
00:01:46 but when you  they speak faster you don't
00:01:48 understand it a reason it may be that you have
00:01:52 learned vocabulary in the form of
00:01:55 translations that you have studied
00:01:57 vocabulary either at school or on
00:02:00 your own and you have learned
00:02:04 words as a translation as a
00:02:06 translation into English or your language
00:02:08 as in maybe  looking at the dictionary or
00:02:13 something and you have learned that this word well
00:02:15 that table in Spanish is equal to such
00:02:18 that it happens that these words even if they
00:02:22 are not all even if they are a few
00:02:24 words not these words when
00:02:27 you are not the social ones directly to their
00:02:32 meaning today the  word table and you don't
00:02:35 immediately think of a table
00:02:38 why why haven't you acquired the
00:02:41 word table yet at the moment  you
00:02:44 have not heard the word table
00:02:47 enough times you have not heard it
00:02:49 many times you have not been able to
00:02:52 connect it directly with it meaning
00:02:56 with the concept with the idea of ​​a table
00:02:59 that you have made
00:03:00 you have connected the word table with the
00:03:04 seven and bolt or any word  In
00:03:06 your language, it is not a connection,
00:03:09 well, very very close, very fine, and to
00:03:13 cross you have to translate, you have to
00:03:16 think in your head that it was a
00:03:18 table, so it was a table, and you have to do
00:03:22 that, and if you have to do that for
00:03:25 several words when you are listening
00:03:27 Spanish takes time it takes more time and of
00:03:30 course if they give you more time because the
00:03:33 person speaks slowly
00:03:36 then if you are going to be able to understand more
00:03:40 what is the solution to acquire the
00:03:43 vocabulary and to acquire this
00:03:45 vocabulary that you have not yet
00:03:47 acquired that you are translating in
00:03:49 your head  You simply have to
00:03:52 receive more input, continue receiving
00:03:55 input, it is not necessary for that input to
00:03:57 speak quickly, speak with  or talk
00:04:01 you have to listen input input real
00:04:04 input in which they are explaining something
00:04:07 in the input that really has
00:04:09 meaning that is not a table chair wall
00:04:13 window whatever because a story
00:04:16 someone explaining
00:04:18 something that really has meaning the
00:04:21 second reason why when  someone
00:04:25 speaks fast you don't understand it is that
00:04:28 when they speak fast maybe they are using
00:04:32 words that you don't know yet maybe
00:04:35 because they speak fast you don't have time to
00:04:37 identify them you don't know how to identify
00:04:40 that word I don't know it maybe two or
00:04:43 three words you can't divide them
00:04:46 because you don't  You know the words and even if
00:04:49 this person had spoken more slowly, they
00:04:52 would have spoken more slowly, you
00:04:56 would not have understood it either, but you don't know
00:04:58 because the word the person spoke
00:05:01 quickly and you have not been able to separate
00:05:05 the words,
00:05:06 realizing that they are words that you
00:05:09 still do not know the solution to  for this,
00:05:13 it is the same to continue with the input and
00:05:16 continue acquiring vocabulary to
00:05:18 get to acquire and  This vocabulary that
00:05:22 you don't know yet, or another similar reason,
00:05:26 is that when a person
00:05:30 speaks slowly, perhaps he uses a word that
00:05:34 you know that word but with other
00:05:37 meanings or with a
00:05:39 similar meaning but not exactly the same, or
00:05:42 the person uses an expression that you
00:05:45 You still don't know you haven't heard
00:05:47 yet but if
00:05:51 you think about it you can imagine
00:05:54 what it means no what if he talks fast well
00:05:57 he doesn't give you time he doesn't give you time to
00:05:59 think to see what this means
00:06:01 because he's already saying more things
00:06:03 solution to this, it is the same there are
00:06:06 words that have meanings that
00:06:09 you know and others that you do not know yet
00:06:12 you have to receive more input to
00:06:14 also acquire those meanings that you
00:06:17 do not know yet there are expressions of
00:06:20 several words that when used in
00:06:23 this way mean something else
00:06:25 they have another meaning you also have
00:06:29 to receive input to learn this
00:06:32 meaning of this expression and when
00:06:34 you learn it you will be able to understand it  Although they
00:06:37 speak very fast for this it is also a
00:06:42 matter of receiving more input it is not
00:06:45 necessary to be inputs be fast when it will
00:06:48 really acquire jce most of
00:06:51 these expressions you will begin to
00:06:54 realize that the same thing happens as in your
00:06:57 native language when someone is
00:06:59 speaking many times already  Can you imagine what
00:07:03 he is going to say next because there are
00:07:06 many words or expressions that are
00:07:09 used together, the more this happens to you,
00:07:12 the more intuition you have of what
00:07:15 he is going to say next, it will be
00:07:17 easy for you to understand a person
00:07:21 who speaks quickly because in the end he will say it.
00:07:24 The only thing you need is to confirm
00:07:28 that that person is saying what you already
00:07:31 imagined that he was going to say, so
00:07:34 finally, the only case in which it
00:07:38 may be that you need practice
00:07:41 listening to people speaking fast and
00:07:45 this is the way in which the pronunciation
00:07:48 changes when  a person speaks quickly
00:07:52 the way we eat letters how
00:07:56 we simplify or eliminate sounds
00:07:58 when we are speaking r  fast and this
00:08:02 still happens even more when we
00:08:06 speak colloquially informally
00:08:09 with friends and such
00:08:11 to have practice listening to these
00:08:13 changes yes we need to hear people
00:08:17 speaking fast because when someone
00:08:20 speaks slowly as I am speaking
00:08:22 now when he is careful to
00:08:24 pronounce  all the sounds don't
00:08:27 happen these phenomena don't change the
00:08:30 pronunciation but when someone talks
00:08:32 fast when they talk to friends family and
00:08:34 so on these things happen and we
00:08:38 need to hear them to make it
00:08:41 easier it also helps just to know a
00:08:45 lot of words to know a lot of
00:08:47 expressions because like  I have told you
00:08:49 before if you already imagine what he
00:08:52 is going to say next, it is not necessary for them to tell you
00:08:55 all the letters only with some
00:08:58 parts and you understand it is okay if he has told you
00:09:01 this thing that I already imagined no and then
00:09:04 with these changes when sometimes we
00:09:07 we eat letters or the end of a
00:09:09 word
00:09:10 normally they are very easy to deduce
00:09:14 normally you can imagine it
00:09:17 p  because instead of saying let's go home
00:09:19 we say let's go home
00:09:21 well it
00:09:23 doesn't change that much or not maybe if there are
00:09:26 many in a row you can get a
00:09:29 bit confused but if you already know the
00:09:32 vocabulary well with exposure to this type
00:09:35 of speech you'll get used to it it's not
00:09:38 something that  It is difficult to learn and it is
00:09:41 easier if you have already acquired a lot of
00:09:45 vocabulary and many expressions before
00:09:47 then if you have reached this point
00:09:51 when the only thing that is left for you is
00:09:54 used to these differences, then
00:09:58 if it makes sense to start listening to
00:10:00 people speaking faster, it
00:10:03 tends to  spend a lot in movies, in
00:10:06 television series and such that people speak
00:10:08 in a more colloquial way, especially in
00:10:11 certain types of certain genres of series
00:10:14 and movies,
00:10:16 so as a conclusion to understand
00:10:19 when natives speak quickly, the most
00:10:22 important thing is to continue receiving input
00:10:25 to continue acquiring  vocabulary
00:10:28 expresses
00:10:29 grammar also up to a certain point
00:10:32 and you can keep doing this no
00:10:35 need to listen to g  keep talking very
00:10:38 fast until you get to a point
00:10:41 where
00:10:42 when people talk fast you
00:10:44 understand it enough you already understand I don't know 80
00:10:48 to 90% of the meaning and then
00:10:52 you can hear more of this type of
00:10:56 faster speech and for me I think this is
00:11:00 The fastest way you will
00:11:03 understand native speakers
00:11:06 speaking naturally speaking in a
00:11:08 colloquial way when they speak especially among
00:11:11 themselves between native speakers okay come

215,"00:00:00 In this book I am going to tell you a
00:00:02 story included in the book Twelve
00:00:06 Pilgrim Tales by the
00:00:10 Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez. It
00:00:13 is the story of a young married
00:00:18 couple who travel from Colombia
00:00:22 to Spain and in Spain they
00:00:26 encounter a big problem
00:00:32 [Music]
00:00:35 Hello  In this video I am going to tell you a
00:00:40 story titled the trace of your blood
00:00:43 in the snow and in this story there is a
00:00:48 couple, a young married couple barely 18
00:00:53 years old,
00:00:55 his name is Billy Sánchez and she is
00:00:58 called Nena Daconte and they travel from
00:01:03 Colombia to Spain.  they are going by plane
00:01:08 from colombia to spain to madrid
00:01:12 for their honeymoon trip
00:01:16 from madrid they have to go
00:01:20 to paris to celebrate their
00:01:23 honeymoon when this couple arrives in madrid
00:01:28 at the airport there are some friends of the
00:01:34 groom's parents  who are there
00:01:38 waiting to receive them to receive
00:01:41 the newlyweds
00:01:45 and they bring gifts to the
00:01:48 newlyweds this couple is
00:01:50 carrying a bouquet of roses for baby  Daconte
00:01:55 for the bride and he also drives a
00:02:00 very large and luxurious car for the groom,
00:02:04 they greet each other and Daconte girl takes the
00:02:09 bouquet of roses
00:02:12 and pricks her finger like a thorn
00:02:16 from the bouquet of roses, she doesn't think
00:02:20 much about it, she just continues talking  with
00:02:25 their friends
00:02:27 and together they go to dinner they go to dinner at the
00:02:31 house of those friends of billy's father
00:02:37 and then they continue on their way in the
00:02:41 new car babe and billy continue the
00:02:45 road from madrid to paris it
00:02:51 's a very cold night it's very cold and it
00:02:55 's  it's snowing and billy is very happy
00:03:00 driving his new car but at that
00:03:04 moment
00:03:05 baby girl daconte realizes that her
00:03:09 finger
00:03:11 is
00:03:12 still bleeding the finger that has been
00:03:16 pricked with the thorns of the roses continues to bleed
00:03:21 so baby puts a handkerchief on her
00:03:24 finger  He puts on a handkerchief to stop the
00:03:29 bleeding, he puts on the handkerchief and holds it
00:03:32 and they
00:03:34 continue on their way to the
00:03:37 border of Spain with France, but at
00:03:41 the border,
00:03:42 Nena realizes that her finger is
00:03:46 still sa  Enlarging the tissue it
00:03:50 is completely soaked in blood
00:03:54 so billy rolls down the
00:03:58 car window and asks the guards
00:04:02 at the border
00:04:04 if there is a pharmacy nearby to
00:04:08 buy something to cure baby's finger
00:04:12 the guards at the border
00:04:16 tell him  to billy that on such a cold night
00:04:20 with so much snow it will be very difficult to
00:04:25 find an open pharmacy so
00:04:29 they continue on their way looking to see if
00:04:33 there is a pharmacy but they can't find
00:04:37 any pharmacy in the end daconte girl
00:04:41 takes another handkerchief and wraps it around her
00:04:46 finger but still the finger keeps
00:04:51 bleeding
00:04:52 so she has an idea she thinks
00:04:56 maybe if i put my hand out the window
00:05:00 in the cold the bleeding will stop the
00:05:04 bleeding will stop so she puts
00:05:08 her hand out the window
00:05:11 and falls asleep
00:05:15 baby's blood goes  leaving a
00:05:18 red trail on the snow when baby
00:05:22 wakes up the bleeding hasn't stopped she's
00:05:27 still bleeding and now there's blood on
00:05:31 her clothes there's blood on the car seat
00:05:35 car babe isn't feeling well she's
00:05:39 getting pale billy is
00:05:42 worried but they're going to be in paris soon as they get
00:05:47 closer to paris
00:05:50 babe asks billy to take her to a
00:05:54 hospital at the hospital they take babe to
00:05:59 intensive care
00:06:02 the doctor tells her  he tells billy that the only
00:06:07 visiting days are tuesdays bill and he
00:06:12 can't stay with baby he can't
00:06:14 stay there with her but he
00:06:17 has to leave and only on tuesday
00:06:21 can he visit her again but
00:06:26 tuesday is a week away bill and he's very
00:06:31 sad and  very worried but he can't
00:06:35 do anything he has to leave so he
00:06:38 looks for a small hotel right in front
00:06:42 of the hospital
00:06:43 where every day he waits anguished he
00:06:48 waits for time to pass so he can
00:06:52 go see nena daconte every day billy has
00:06:57 breakfast in a cafe and goes to the  hospital door
00:07:03 hoping to see the doctor who
00:07:07 treated nena daconte when she came in the
00:07:11 first day when she was admitted to the hospital
00:07:14 but billy doesn't see the doctor doesn't see the
00:07:18 doctor go in or out  from the hospital
00:07:22 also billy doesn't know how to speak french
00:07:25 because he is colombian and he doesn't speak
00:07:30 any french
00:07:30 so he can't ask the
00:07:36 people who come in and out of the hospital
00:07:38 he can't ask he can't ask for
00:07:41 any information in french he
00:07:44 can only wait at a
00:07:48 given moment billy  he tries to enter the hospital
00:07:51 and tries to enter by force but the
00:07:55 security guards prevent him from doing so and he can't
00:07:59 get to see baby when
00:08:03 bill finally arrives on tuesday and enters the
00:08:07 hospital and goes searching the pavilion in
00:08:11 the hospital part  where the
00:08:15 women are, he looks through all the beds
00:08:18 to find nena daconte but he doesn't
00:08:22 find her well and he searches everywhere
00:08:26 but he doesn't find nena
00:08:29 but in the end billy finds the
00:08:32 doctor who admitted nena daconte the
00:08:36 doctor they talked to bill  and he
00:08:39 asks him he asks about nena daconte
00:08:42 where is nena daconte where is my
00:08:46 wife and the doctor answers nena
00:08:50 daconte died last Thursday

00:08:58 have watched over her body and have buried her

00:01:01 whether Spain is better or worse Spain and
00:01:07 Mexico which of the two is better to
00:01:11 live to live to have your house is
00:01:16 better Mexico or better Spain and
00:01:21 I will support Spain and Mexico will support you
00:01:27 ok spain spain I think it
00:01:32 's better because in Spain the food is
00:01:36 very good the tapas tapas for example in
00:01:40 Mexico I don't think there are no it's hard to
00:01:43 find tapas and they are good desks I
00:01:46 already think the tapas are very good
00:01:50 however webber in mexico  also
00:01:53 We have very tasty food, what food, I
00:01:57 think that Mexican food is not,
00:01:59 hahaha, well, and the Mexican community is a World
00:02:06 Heritage Site recognized
00:02:08 by UNESCO. Back, yes, because it has a
00:02:11 lot of influence from pre-Hispanic cultures
00:02:15 from before the Spanish,
00:02:19 Mexico was not at all, there were no  Mayans the Aztecs and they
00:02:24 had food that is still eaten now
00:02:27 it has been mixed a little
00:02:30 clear it has been mixed with ingredients
00:02:31 that have been brought from other places and
00:02:34 well it always depends on the region to
00:02:37 mexico different regions yes because they
00:02:40 suit me differently it's like four  times
00:02:43 larger than Spain and Spain does not have
00:02:47 a surface area and Mexico is 44 times
00:02:52 larger than Spain
00:02:53 but but I think that Mexican food
00:02:57 is very spicy and that means if it is
00:03:00 very spicy no I don't like it I don't
00:03:03 like spicy food
00:03:07 a  times and it's very spicy so you don't
00:03:10 enjoy your dish very good if you do
00:03:15 n't either but there is a stereotype
00:03:18 that all Mexican food is interesting
00:03:20 but  It is not like that, not like all the food, not
00:03:23 all Mexican food is in Chile,
00:03:27 but yes, they are all very tasty, they
00:03:30 are all very good, and more than the
00:03:32 tapas,
00:03:35 which is very small,
00:03:38 so the tapas are very small.
00:03:44 you fill very well
00:03:51 but but in spain we have one thing that
00:03:55 are ours our women that in
00:04:00 spain are very pretty yes yes yes yes yes they
00:04:07 are better
00:04:10 well in mexico they are also very
00:04:17 handsome in fact well i am from the north
00:04:20 of mexico ok terea is from the north  from the
00:04:23 north
00:04:25 of mexico and in mexico it is said that
00:04:30 women from the north are the most beautiful in
00:04:32 the
00:04:33 country women from the north are the most
00:04:35 beautiful and changeable too and me
00:04:39 too man what do you think tr3
00:04:46 is pretty or not of course yes good and there is
00:04:53 Guadalajara is another city that is also
00:04:54 world famous in Guadalajara and in
00:04:58 Guadalajara the women are also very
00:05:00 pretty
00:05:01 Jimena Navarrete is from Guadalajara and was
00:05:03 Miss Universe Jimena Navarrete is Miss
00:05:07 Universe
00:05:08 Oysters, well  That adds up to a very good very good
00:05:11 argument and oysters well in Mexico
00:05:13 there are also women who are
00:05:16 pretty
00:05:19 and very nice girls they are also very
00:05:22 nice
00:05:27 in Spain in the north not everyone
00:05:31 is nice yes in the south more more people
00:05:35 in Egypt have more advantages than
00:05:38 advantages because in mexico well if you
00:05:42 look this is a little more to the south
00:05:45 than we are to the south
00:05:46 so if the people from the south of spain
00:05:48 are nicer the people further south of
00:05:52 spain
00:05:54 then mexico the people are
00:05:57 nicer friendlier on average it's
00:06:00 more  much nicer than in
00:06:03 many countries there are many more than
00:06:05 germany but well that is one of the
00:06:09 happiest countries depending on whether we cannot
00:06:13 leave happiness if mexico is very very
00:06:16 high within the countries of the whole
00:06:19 world very good
00:06:21 but in spain it always comes out very  well in
00:06:26 quality of life quality of life means
00:06:29 that you are happy that you have little
00:06:33 stress yes work also
00:06:39 friends the love of a lifetime
00:06:45 and we also have a life expectancy
00:06:49 very high in spain I don't know if they are more or
00:06:53 less about 80 80 years old not until
00:06:59 they are very very very old and people
00:07:04 die very late they don't even get older yes yes
00:07:07 yes that is something good about spain in mexico
00:07:10 it doesn't reach 80 it is  my vertigo at least for
00:07:13 that reason mexico is not wanted to come to spain
00:07:18 here but they can not come to the best not
00:07:21 so many people in spain because it is a
00:07:24 smaller country spain is very small
00:07:26 so we do not see more mexico is very
00:07:33 big and that is better because  You have a
00:07:37 lot of desert, well, you have more
00:07:39 opportunities to work somewhere,
00:07:43 mentally, too. In Mexico, there is more
00:07:45 population.
00:08:07 there are more jobs and
00:08:11 more opportunities and well the beaches the
00:08:15 beaches in spain are very beautiful the beach
00:08:18 does not go down and so because
00:08:21 mexico is bigger you have more
00:08:23 beautiful beaches mexico is bigger so there are a
00:08:25 lot of  do more and on the beach there are not many
00:08:30 many people because here in spain many
00:08:33 times on the beach you are very crowded and
00:08:36 why because many people from all over
00:08:39 europe come to vacation to harm not
00:08:42 many people many people from europe come
00:08:45 to spain
00:08:46 so the  beaches we are very
00:08:48 crowded a lot of people a lot of people
00:08:51 yes in mexico not mexico the beaches are
00:08:55 very big
00:08:56 myles and there are tourist beaches and there are
00:08:59 beaches where you don't see a soul in
00:09:01 fact the first time i drove a car
00:09:03 for the first time the first time  who drove you
00:09:07 a car the first time he
00:09:09 drove you a car he was 12 years old and he was
00:09:12 at the beach
00:09:13 12 years old if he is at the beach and consists
00:09:19 of sand 5 the sand was a
00:09:22 giant ram that is a giant an SUV
00:09:28 issued in  4x4 no
00:09:33 on the beach there is no one
00:09:40 barcelona- it drives is a
00:09:45 police car and in mexico the beaches are
00:09:53 very large beaches with very few people very
00:09:57 good very good but spain has one thing
00:10:01 that I like I like a lot and
00:10:06 that is that in  it is  cloth in summer in summer
00:10:10 beach there is sun but then in winter
00:10:16 we have
00:10:18 [Music]
00:10:19 we have mountains
00:10:22 mountains and it snows and you can go skiing
00:10:25 you can do you can snowboard
00:10:29 if that's the case and I think that in mexico you don't
00:10:33 have that
00:10:36 there is a place in mexico where everything  the year
00:10:38 is snowy all year long there is snow
00:10:41 in the center of the country snow in the center
00:10:45 because of the 'no' to the north and south but in the
00:10:49 middle there are mountains
00:10:55 all year round there is snow and snow in the
00:10:59 mountains and you can ski
00:11:03 [Music]
00:11:05 yes it can be no we don't know if in
00:11:08 mexico you can ski it
00:11:11 's line no it's not normal in spain it's
00:11:15 spain it's quite small but it's very
00:11:18 close to the beach the mountains to ski
00:11:21 we have desert we have forests if you go
00:11:25 to galicia
00:11:28 galicia asturias there's a lot a lot  forest
00:11:32 and the forest is very different from what
00:11:34 we have in the rest of spain'
00:11:37 around here there is a desert it is very very
00:11:42 varied where I live here near the
00:11:46 sea of ​​cortez
00:11:49 just as if it was just right now
00:11:52 well course he lived a long time  or in
00:11:54 mexico and that's how he didn't know how nice he
00:11:57 lived for a long time no his house was
00:12:01 in mexico and he said that the sea of ​​cortez
00:12:04 which was the aquarium of the world the sea what
00:12:08 is it called sea of ​​cortez sea of ​​cortez is
00:12:10 here the entrance  It is yes it is that
00:12:13 the sea enters Mexico and this sea is the
00:12:18 aquarium of the world it is like an aquarium
00:12:20 like an aquarium fish
00:12:24 fish it
00:12:26 is like the aquarium of the world because there are
00:12:29 many many different fish and that is
00:12:33 where I go it is a fight  And as we
00:12:37 saw in the first video, if you are going
00:12:39 to snorkel with a leaf tube here in this
00:12:43 sea and if I put a link below
00:12:47 to click on the video in which she
00:12:49 tells you that she likes
00:12:52 to snorkel
00:12:55 Oysters, well, I think it's okay,

00:13:34 patrimony of the nation
",3
018,"00:00:00 but well he does it that way
00:00:02 and we have to accept it
00:00:09 hello good morning today we are going to talk
00:00:12 about a series of illustrations
00:00:14 illustrations about pickpockets
00:00:18 pickpockets are people who steal they
00:00:22 rob people on the street or on public transport they
00:00:28 steal wallets they steal  mobiles whatever
00:00:33 in total there are 18 illustrations it's like a
00:00:36 comic a comic with 18 panels
00:00:41 in the first panel we see a boy
00:00:46 a boy with black hair wearing a
00:00:50 t-shirt a pink shirt or t-shirt
00:00:53 with black pants that
00:00:56 has
00:00:58 the  hand has his right hand in his
00:01:01 pocket and with his left hand he holds
00:01:04 the mobile phone he is looking at the mobile phone while
00:01:08 waiting for the train he is waiting for the train at
00:01:11 the station there are two more people
00:01:14 waiting for the train on the same platform as
00:01:17 the boy and they can also see  the
00:01:20 opposite platform and on the opposite platform there is
00:01:23 no one the boy is looking at
00:01:27 the mobile screen he is distracting
00:01:30 I don't know what they are doing maybe looking at
00:01:33 messages or watching a video  eo or whatever
00:01:36 while waiting for the train to come
00:01:40 then there are two more people there is a
00:01:42 woman
00:01:43 a lady also with
00:01:46 long black hair wearing clothes with a yellow blouse and
00:01:51 skirt and holding a
00:01:54 bag she has a bag holding it  in the
00:01:57 hand you can also see another man who can
00:02:00 only see the upper half a man who can
00:02:03 also be seen wearing a
00:02:05 yellow shirt with black hair and the
00:02:08 three of them are waiting for him to come to the train
00:02:12 and the three of them are waiting on the platform  and in
00:02:15 front of them they have the train tracks not
00:02:17 which is where it goes where it goes to the train
00:02:19 and the three of them are waiting
00:02:24 in the second panel we see the train that
00:02:27 arrives it is the train it is not known if it is a
00:02:32 train or a subway but you can see the
00:02:35 front of the train not the cabin with two
00:02:38 headlights to illuminate with glass glass
00:02:42 in front of the train and you can also see two
00:02:46 pairs of doors of the train the doors
00:02:48 that people use to get in and out of the
00:02:51 train to get on and off the train and you can see
00:02:55 that each door of each pa  r of doors
00:02:57 has a window has a glass to
00:03:00 see what is inside and see what is
00:03:01 outside so the boy we see the same
00:03:06 boy we see the same three
00:03:08 people and the boy has
00:03:10 looked up from the mobile he is no longer looking at the
00:03:12 mobile  and he is looking at the train how it arrives
00:03:15 it is seen that the train is moving it
00:03:18 still has lines of movement like
00:03:20 it has not stopped yet
00:03:23 and the boy is looking at the train that is
00:03:25 arriving and he has his hand in his pocket
00:03:29 yet but he has not started to walk
00:03:36 in the third panel you can see the same
00:03:39 three people the three people have
00:03:42 approached the edge of the platform they have
00:03:45 approached the train that is already stopped
00:03:49 and they have approached to get ready to
00:03:51 get on the train not because if they take a
00:03:54 long time maybe the train will leave and  don't give them
00:03:56 time to get on then they have
00:03:58 approached the doors
00:04:00 and we see the two pairs of
00:04:03 doors open the doors open and the three
00:04:06 people the two men and the woman
00:04:08 wait on the sides of the doors that
00:04:12 's from  good manners because that way the
00:04:13 people inside the train can
00:04:16 get out first and you always have to
00:04:18 let the people inside out before
00:04:20 trying to get in because sometimes there are
00:04:21 rude people who don't let the
00:04:24 people inside out before getting in and  This
00:04:26 causes problems especially if there are a lot of
00:04:28 people trying to get out
00:04:30 and you can see the two pairs of doors that
00:04:34 are half open, they are not
00:04:36 completely open yet but it has already
00:04:39 started to open, they are not closed anymore and you
00:04:43 can see above each pair of doors.
00:04:46 two arrows and the arrows indicate the
00:04:50 direction in which the doors are
00:04:53 opening they are opening
00:04:56 outwards and we see the three people here
00:04:59 waiting for the doors to finish opening
00:05:02 and then they get on the train
00:05:09 in cartoon number 4 we see in the  In the same
00:05:13 situation we see the three people
00:05:15 waiting to get on the train but
00:05:18 the doors have already been opened the
00:05:21 doors have opened completely and
00:05:23 passengers who were
00:05:26 on the train and they have started to leave and
00:05:28 we see one two three four five six
00:05:31 seven seven people at one door and
00:05:34 three people and at another there are four
00:05:36 people leaving the train they are
00:05:39 leaving the train and it looks good that
00:05:41 maybe they have a little  hurry up they go to
00:05:43 work or go anywhere and they
00:05:45 walk and they look good because
00:05:49 some are dressed in a shirt others
00:05:51 in a t-shirt a lady also with
00:05:53 a bag in her hand
00:05:56 and the other three people are
00:05:59 waiting to get on the train they are
00:06:02 waiting  because the
00:06:05 people leaving the train have just left so that they can
00:06:08 then enter
00:06:15 in cartoon number 5 we see that the
00:06:19 people who were leaving the train
00:06:20 have already left and that's how they
00:06:23 are seeing now only two
00:06:26 people can be seen  a man and a woman can be seen
00:06:28 the woman from before carrying the
00:06:31 bag hanging from her arm
00:06:34 and they are already leaving they are already far from the
00:06:38 door so the three people who
00:06:41 were waiting to get on the
00:06:43 train and have  started walking
00:06:46 into the train and they are about
00:06:48 to cross the doors and enter
00:06:52 the train
00:06:57 in cartoon number 6 we see the interior
00:07:01 of the car
00:07:03 the car is each one of the different
00:07:07 compartments that it is
00:07:11 made of  train
00:07:12 then in this car you can see the boy
00:07:15 that we have seen before in the
00:07:17 pink shirt and he is holding a vertical bar
00:07:21 that there is for people to hold onto so
00:07:24 that when the train starts and stops
00:07:28 people do not fall off
00:07:29 then we see the boy in the  pink t-shirt
00:07:32 and we see other people who are
00:07:36 in the car we also see several
00:07:39 people holding on to a
00:07:42 horizontal bar an upper bar that
00:07:45 they also hold on to so as not to fall when
00:07:47 the train starts and stops we see several
00:07:50 people holding on we see
00:07:52 a few men and we also see a
00:07:55 woman who may be the woman from
00:07:57 before who was waiting for the train
00:07:59 also carrying a bag a
00:08:04 type of bag hanging from her arm
00:08:08 and the boy  from before the pink shirt
00:08:12 of the black pants we see that he is
00:08:14 holding he is holding the
00:08:17 vertical bar with his left hand and he is
00:08:21 holding the mobile with his right hand
00:08:24 the boy I don't know if he is right-handed or
00:08:27 left-handed because before he was using the
00:08:30 mobile with his hand  left but now
00:08:31 he is using it with his right hand
00:08:34 maybe ambidextrous maybe he can use
00:08:37 both left and right hands without
00:08:38 any problem it is impressive
00:08:42 and then you can see that the carriage is
00:08:45 quite crowded there are quite a few people they
00:08:47 are a bit crowded because it can be seen that
00:08:49 there are  many many people in a little space
00:08:57 in cartoon number 7 we see the detail
00:09:01 of the boy's ass the ass is the
00:09:06 back part not the back part of the
00:09:08 pants we can see a detail of the
00:09:13 lower part of the back we can see the back
00:09:15 of the boy of the boy in the pink t-shirt you
00:09:17 can see the back you can see the
00:09:20 boy's arm the arm you can see the elbow that is
00:09:23 bent his arm is not bent and you can
00:09:26 see the elbow and you can see the black pants  of the
00:09:29 boy and in his pants you can see that he is carrying
00:09:32 his wallet he has the wallet in the
00:09:35 back pocket he has the wallet
00:09:37 tucked in the pocket it is a yellow wallet of
00:09:40 yellow color and the
00:09:45 wallet well I imagine it has the and
00:09:47 the money the cards  no, the wallet is
00:09:50 used to carry all types of
00:09:52 cards, credit cards, ID cards,
00:09:57 social security card or whatever
00:10:00 , discount cards for the
00:10:03 supermarket or whatever
00:10:11 in bullet number 8 is  he sees the same
00:10:14 detail as before of the boy's back and ass
00:10:16 but he also sees a hand
00:10:19 a hand that we don't know whose it is
00:10:23 that takes his wallet is taking the
00:10:26 wallet from his pocket and has taken
00:10:28 it away he is stealing his wallet  and they can be seen with
00:10:31 the speed lines not that he is
00:10:33 taking his wallet and he has taken it
00:10:36 very, very quickly he is taking it and if he
00:10:40 is a thief it is a pickpocket who steals his
00:10:43 wallet and steals his wallet so he
00:10:46 can steal his money  or and what I
00:10:48 find of value inside the wallet
00:10:51 is usually the money
00:10:53 pickpockets usually take the wallet they keep
00:10:57 the bills different bills you
00:10:59 don't ask for five euros ten euros twenty
00:11:01 euros they keep the bills and
00:11:04 normally they throw the wallet and the
00:11:05 wallet not them  it is of no use to them
00:11:07 they do not want your identity card nor
00:11:11 do they want your driver's license or anything
00:11:12 they only keep the money
00:11:19 in cartoon number 9 we see the train the
00:11:23 train or the subway again that it has arrived
00:11:26 at another station we assume that its another
00:11:29 different station and it was stopping you can
00:11:31 see the station
00:11:33 platform too the platform is the place where people wait for
00:11:35 the train it looks like the train
00:11:38 is still moving so i
00:11:40 guess the train is slowing down to stop at
00:11:43 the station it is not the same  train from before
00:11:45 with the two headlights in front of the train with
00:11:48 the window in front and with the two sets
00:11:51 of doors and you can see that there is no one waiting on the platform,
00:11:55 there are no people and you can't
00:11:58 see anything else in  this cartoon
00:12:05 in cartoon number 10 it can be seen that the train
00:12:09 has already stopped the doors the two
00:12:12 sets of doors have opened and there are
00:12:14 people getting out of the train there is the boy in
00:12:18 the pink t-shirt is also getting out
00:12:20 of the train
00:12:21 and he is calm he is not nervous  no it doesn't
00:12:26 seem like he hasn't noticed that
00:12:28 his wallet has been stolen he hasn't found out his wallet has
00:12:30 been stolen and he
00:12:33 doesn't don't know he doesn't know it was
00:12:35 stolen because he's calm as if
00:12:37 there was no problem so we'll see
00:12:40 in  this cartoon that there are several people
00:12:42 leaving the train there is the woman in the
00:12:45 yellow blouse who has her bag
00:12:48 hanging from her arm and is dressed in a
00:12:50 skirt
00:12:51 we see the boy in the pink shirt and
00:12:56 also six other people there are men and
00:13:00 women you can see several men  who
00:13:02 also wear shirts or t-shirts with
00:13:06 pants
00:13:08 and in total there are 6 88 people who are
00:13:12 all leaving the train they
00:13:15 are leaving the train and it is seen that there is
00:13:17 no one waiting on the platform to
00:13:19 get on the train and they are leaving and  everyone
00:13:27 in panel number 11 you can see the boy in
00:13:30 the pink t-shirt who is on an
00:13:32 escalator he is at the station
00:13:36 I guess he is at the station there is a
00:13:39 sign above the
00:13:42 boy's head pointing down indicating a
00:13:44 direction I guess  indicates the exit,
00:13:47 perhaps the exit from the station, which is the
00:13:49 place where you exit the station,
00:13:51 you go out onto the street, so it's going down, there
00:13:55 are some escalators that go
00:13:58 down, they don't go down, and there are
00:14:02 several people on the escalators,
00:14:08 the boy  Now he is not using his mobile,
00:14:11 that is, he is not one of those who is most
00:14:13 hooked on his mobile, he is not one of the
00:14:15 people who is most hooked on his
00:14:17 mobile because he does not take advantage of every
00:14:19 second he can to look at it, but
00:14:21 we can already see the boy in front of him
00:14:23 yours who has a t-shirt is
00:14:26 wearing a yellow t-shirt that if you are already
00:14:29 looking at the mobile in the few
00:14:31 seconds that the escalator has
00:14:34 then you see several people in it  On the
00:14:36 escalator you can see four people
00:14:38 who are riding the
00:14:41 escalator there are two who are in front of the
00:14:43 boy and you can see a lady who is behind
00:14:48 the boy a lady who is also
00:14:50 holding something in her hand maybe it is
00:14:52 also a bag and behind the  ma'am, you
00:14:55 see a fifth person who is walking
00:14:59 towards the escalator but it
00:15:01 seems that he hasn't gotten on it yet that
00:15:03 he must be about to get on
00:15:08 and you see that the escalator goes
00:15:09 down to another
00:15:12 lower floor on the upper floor is  the floor
00:15:14 where the platform is where the subway has stopped you
00:15:16 can see that there is a column the
00:15:19 column that holds the ceiling and the ceiling
00:15:23 is where the sign is hung from the
00:15:25 sign indicating the direction of the
00:15:32 exit cartoon number 12 shows the doors
00:15:36 of the  train are the doors through which you have
00:15:39 to pass the ticket to be able to enter and
00:15:42 leave the station to be able to get on
00:15:44 the train and get off the train
00:15:46 we see the boy in the pink shirt who
00:15:50 is all  the road is so quiet he still
00:15:53 hasn't realized his wallet has been stolen
00:15:56 and he's walking towards the gates he's
00:15:59 walking towards the gates this is
00:16:01 normally a time to start
00:16:02 preparing the ticket because many times
00:16:05 in many train systems you have to
00:16:08 use the  ticket to leave the
00:16:10 station because the ticket there are quite a few
00:16:15 train systems in which you pay
00:16:16 a different amount of money depending on
00:16:19 the distance traveled or depending on the
00:16:20 station you go to, so in
00:16:23 many places it is mandatory to pass the
00:16:26 ticket through the machine to  to leave so
00:16:28 that the doors open and to be able to leave
00:16:30 to be able to leave the station in
00:16:34 addition to the boy in the pink t-shirt
00:16:36 we see two other men also
00:16:39 walking towards the doors we see the
00:16:42 man from before on the
00:16:44 escalators who is still hooked to the
00:16:48 mobile despite  that he is already walking and
00:16:51 I hope that he does not fall that he does
00:16:53 not hit himself because it is dangerous to walk
00:16:55 while using the mobile and if you do not go with
00:17:00 be careful with what is around
00:17:01 you you can touch people and
00:17:03 disturb people is something that you have to be
00:17:05 careful and we also see another man another
00:17:10 man with a yellow shirt with
00:17:12 shorter hair who is closer to the
00:17:16 doors and  that is also about to
00:17:19 leave the station
00:17:23 the doors we see that they have a
00:17:26 direction indicator it is not a round one
00:17:29 in which there is a cross and the cross indicates
00:17:32 that it is not possible to pass in that direction
00:17:33 through the doors and that is because the
00:17:36 doors  they are for the entrance I mean the doors
00:17:39 are not for the entrance they are for the exit so
00:17:42 you can leave as
00:17:45 the three boys that we see are about to do are going to
00:17:48 leave the station but you can
00:17:50 not enter you cannot go from from
00:17:53 outside to inside in  In this direction
00:17:55 you have to use other doors where,
00:17:58 instead of having a cross like this one,
00:17:59 there is an arrow pointing forward or 'the
00:18:01 system that they use to indicate
00:18:05 that you can enter the station through here, you
00:18:09 can see that the doors are  They have
00:18:13 some triangles, some
00:18:15 red or orange triangles that are
00:18:19 rounded at the top, so
00:18:22 I understand that they are
00:18:24 rotating and they go inside the machine when
00:18:28 passing the bill, those triangles
00:18:30 go inside the machine  they
00:18:32 get into the machine and leave
00:18:33 enough space for people
00:18:36 to get out of the station
00:18:42 in panel number 13 we see the boy the
00:18:45 same boy in the pink shirt who is
00:18:50 looking in the back pocket of his
00:18:52 pants not in the pocket of the ass he is
00:18:55 searching, he is going to take the wallet because
00:18:58 surely he must carry the train ticket,
00:19:01 he must carry it in the wallet
00:19:03 and he needs the train ticket to be
00:19:06 able to leave the station because if he does
00:19:09 not, he cannot leave the station, he cannot go through the
00:19:11 machines that we have seen before, he needs
00:19:13 put the ticket in the machine to
00:19:16 get out of the station then
00:19:18 we see how he uses his left hand
00:19:23 to search his pocket
00:19:27 despite the fact that the  pocket he had it on the
00:19:29 right side in the right pocket it's
00:19:31 a bit I think it's okay it's going to be a bit
00:19:33 difficult to reach the right pocket
00:19:35 with his left arm but hey he
00:19:38 does it that way and we have to
00:19:40 accept it
00:19:41 and he's using his hand  left, so
00:19:45 it looks more likely that he is
00:19:48 left-handed than not right-handed, not that he
00:19:50 uses his left hand more often for
00:19:52 more things, that he has more skill with
00:19:54 his left hand, but hey
00:19:57 , the possibility that it is left is still not ruled out
00:19:59 that it is extra envy and we see we
00:20:02 see the upper part of the boy you can
00:20:04 see his face in the shirt in the
00:20:06 pants you can see his right hand
00:20:08 too and it looks good he looks
00:20:12 happy he looks like this and smiling he doesn't seem
00:20:14 worried  it is clear that he has not
00:20:17 yet realized that his wallet has been stolen
00:20:23 in cartoon number 14 we see that the
00:20:26 boy is well upset he is not
00:20:29 surprised
00:20:31 and perhaps with a little fear or good
00:20:35 surprise especially because well he has
00:20:37 realizing that he doesn't have the wallet
00:20:39 he doesn't have the wallet he is still with
00:20:43 his left hand he has it behind him he
00:20:45 has it in his ass
00:20:46 surely in his pocket touching himself
00:20:48 touching his pocket and wondering
00:20:50 why the wallet isn't there and where it
00:20:54 should be
00:20:55 they can see him  that come out stripes come out of the
00:20:59 face red stripes as if from surprise that
00:21:03 indicate that he is surprised he is
00:21:06 surprised because he expected the
00:21:08 wallet to be there
00:21:10 and the wallet is not there and he does not know what has
00:21:12 happened because he did not notice
00:21:14 when he was on the train or  in the
00:21:17 subway that someone has taken his
00:21:19 wallet and he is in that moment of
00:21:22 surprise that surely
00:21:25 it hasn't started yet he hasn't started to think
00:21:27 about the consequences of having
00:21:30 his wallet stolen and what it will mean
00:21:32 for him for  the rest of his day
00:21:39 in cartoon number 15 we see that the
00:21:43 boy is still at the station and he is
00:21:46 surrounded by many people there are many people
00:21:48 around him travelers who are entering
00:21:53 or leaving who are  going to the train
00:21:55 or they have just gotten off the train and are
00:21:58 leaving the station above the
00:22:01 people there are two signs a sign that
00:22:04 indicates to the right
00:22:07 sorry to the right and up that
00:22:10 surely indicates the direction of the
00:22:12 cndh in the direction that  You have to
00:22:14 go to go to the platform and
00:22:17 then take a train because it indicates
00:22:20 upwards and we have seen that the
00:22:22 trains were taken from the upper floor
00:22:24 because we have seen that there were
00:22:26 escalators, not that
00:22:30 the boy took to go down  on the east floor and to the
00:22:34 left we see another sign that indicates
00:22:36 to the left that possibly
00:22:38 indicates the exit of the station
00:22:40 where you have to go to go out into the
00:22:42 street
00:22:44 and we see the boy who is in the middle of the
00:22:46 image still surprised with
00:22:49 red stripes that  they come out of his head that he's
00:22:52 looking back he's looking
00:22:54 back to see what happened to see if maybe he
00:22:57 's trying to see someone to see
00:23:01 if he finds someone to find someone  the
00:23:03 person who stole his wallet and
00:23:07 there are many people there are men and women
00:23:09 there are women with bags I don't know why here
00:23:12 well if here many women
00:23:15 carry bags and there are
00:23:18 more people
00:23:21 in the background in the back it looks
00:23:23 like this people who  It's not very clear, you ca
00:23:25 n't see their hair, they're kind of
00:23:28 faded, it doesn't mean they're
00:23:30 far away, and there are people ahead, there are people
00:23:32 who can be seen in the foreground in front of the
00:23:35 boy, a man with
00:23:37 short hair can't be seen.  woman
00:23:39 and the boy is there in the middle of the only
00:23:42 thing that everyone else is
00:23:43 walking they are going in some
00:23:44 direction but he is there still and
00:23:47 surprised and looking to see if he sees the
00:23:49 person who has stolen his wallet
00:23:55 in cartoon number  16 you can see the
00:23:58 doors the doors that we have seen
00:24:00 before the machines that check the
00:24:03 ticket no and that open the door if the
00:24:06 ticket is valid you can see that there is a
00:24:09 woman also a woman in a yellow t-shirt
00:24:11 with a yellow blouse with a
00:24:14 bag that is  yes  aliendo is about to
00:24:18 go through the machine although the doors
00:24:20 have not yet opened in the background you can
00:24:24 see four more people, also men
00:24:26 and women and you can also see two posters
00:24:30 on the ceiling there are two posters hanging
00:24:32 from the ceiling that you can't see I don't know  he sees that they
00:24:35 put up the signs because they are far away and
00:24:38 he sees the boy hurrying away and
00:24:40 going back
00:24:42 towards the direction he came from
00:24:45 I turn back because he is going to try to
00:24:48 find his wallet so he
00:24:51 hurries he walks fast or runs
00:24:54 and goes  backwards he is going to return to the
00:24:57 direction he came from
00:25:00 he is still a little upset a
00:25:03 little surprised you can see some
00:25:05 red stripes also coming out of his head and you can
00:25:08 see lines of speed of how fast he
00:25:12 is going towards he is going to the right
00:25:13 so they look to the left they look at
00:25:16 speed lines because the guy is
00:25:18 walking fast or running to the
00:25:20 right
00:25:25 in panel 17 the same guy
00:25:30 looks the same guy who is still
00:25:32 with the  open mouth looks like he's
00:25:34 still shocked
00:25:36 i wonder how long it's been
00:25:38 since he's found since he's
00:25:40 realized that he's wallet was stolen
00:25:41 but it looks like he's still
00:25:43 open-mouthed still shocked and it
00:25:47 looks like beads of sweat  No, because
00:25:50 of his nerves, he's a little nervous about the
00:25:52 situation. Drops of sweat are coming out of his
00:25:56 head,
00:25:58 so he can be seen in one two three four
00:26:00 five five drops of sweat coming out
00:26:03 of his head
00:26:06 and this guy is holding the mobile with
00:26:09 right hand this time he's using
00:26:10 his right hand so it looks
00:26:13 like this guy is going to be ambidextrous
00:26:14 because he's using both hands
00:26:16 left and right and he's holding
00:26:19 the phone with his right hand he's
00:26:22 I don't know what he's doing  maybe he's
00:26:25 looking at google google what to do
00:26:28 when your wallet is stolen or
00:26:31 how to get out of a metro station without
00:26:33 paying when you've lost your ticket I
00:26:36 don't know I don't know what he was doing
00:26:38 with it  cell phone or maybe he's
00:26:40 trying to call call someone to
00:26:42 help him call the police I don't know
00:26:45 what to see how it continues as the story continues
00:26:53 in panel number 18 we see the same
00:26:58 boy
00:26:58 the boy who is calling with his mobile
00:27:01 is  holding the mobile with his
00:27:04 right hand he is holding it next to his
00:27:07 ear
00:27:11 to talk to someone he is making
00:27:12 a phone call and he is seen
00:27:15 again with his mouth open because this time he
00:27:17 is talking he is talking to someone you
00:27:19 can see that he is also getting three  lines of
00:27:22 the mouth as if to mean that he is
00:27:24 speaking or not and we also see a
00:27:28 bubble a bubble comes out of his mouth
00:27:31 that refers to what the bubble is saying
00:27:35 there is a drawing of what it is
00:27:36 saying and the boy is talking about what
00:27:40 they have said to him  stolen the wallet you can see the image
00:27:42 from before when the wallet was stolen
00:27:43 when the wallet was taken from his
00:27:45 pocket then you see the
00:27:47 boy's ass and the wallet with a hand
00:27:51 that takes the wallet and takes it  UITA from
00:27:52 pocket to the same image that we have
00:27:53 seen before with the hand that stole his
00:27:57 wallet
00:27:59 so the boy is talking to
00:28:02 the mobile he is holding the mobile with
00:28:05 his right hand and with his left hand he
00:28:08 is gesturing as if the person
00:28:10 with the  that he is talking with his cell phone I could
00:28:12 see him but it's a bit useless because he ca
00:28:15 n't see it so it's not much use to make
00:28:17 gestures with his hand but hey, he
00:28:18 does them anyway so he
00:28:21 can also let him express his
00:28:24 feelings that surely he's
00:28:26 pretty upset right now  quite upset and
00:28:29 surprised that someone has
00:28:31 stolen his wallet and surely he has a
00:28:33 certain feeling of lack of
00:28:36 trust in the rest of humanity
00:28:41 and he is talking to who he is talking
00:28:44 to who he is talking to I don't know maybe he
00:28:46 is calling the police
00:28:48 maybe the  boy is calling his mom
00:28:51 because he still doesn't know what to do
00:28:56 when something unexpected happens when
00:28:59 something out of the ordinary happens maybe he doesn't know what to
00:29:02 do and  he's talking to his mom although
00:29:04 iceta is talking to his wife and he
00:29:07 's asking his wife woman woman come
00:29:09 here and help me I need a
00:29:12 train ticket to leave the station
00:29:14 otherwise I can't go home am I don't know
00:29:17 or maybe  No, maybe he's calling the
00:29:19 police, let's find out,
00:29:22 and that's it, that's the end, these are
00:29:25 all the cartoons, and we have finished
00:29:30 explaining the story of this boy
00:29:32 who got on the train or subway and
00:29:35 his wallet was stolen, no.  We see what
00:29:38 happens later when
00:29:40 after your wallet is stolen you
00:29:42 have to do several things you have to
00:29:45 cancel your card, your
00:29:47 debit cards and credit cards
00:29:49 so that they don't take money from the bank
00:29:52 you have to, for example, in Spain if you have
00:29:56 lost the document  identity the ID card
00:30:00 you have to go to the police and notify them
00:30:03 you have to report that your
00:30:05 ID card
00:30:07 has been stolen there are a number of things you have
00:30:09 to do and then you have to redo it and
00:30:10 ask for the different cards
00:30:13 you have  lost and everything you've
00:30:15 lost you have to replace it and make
00:30:17 new cards and cards for all the
00:30:20 cards you had, plus the
00:30:25 annoyance that your
00:30:27 money has been stolen and in general
00:30:30 being upset with the other
00:30:33 people you live with that  never
00:30:36 never is a pleasant feeling it is
00:30:38 quite unpleasant the truth
00:30:42 and that's it we have reached the end and

00:00:06 drink alcoholic beverages
00:00:09 in which country is it allowed? Well
00:00:14 , today I am going to tell you in which state
00:00:18 of Mexico children can drink alcoholic
00:00:21 beverages. Come with me to see it
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:30 How are Sofia and the day?  Today I am going
00:00:35 to tell you about the tuba.
00:00:40 Have you ever heard the word tuba and I am not
00:00:44 referring to the musical instrument because
00:00:48 there is a musical instrument called the
00:00:50 tuba but I am not referring to that I am referring to
00:00:56 a typical drink from Mexico
00:01:00 specifically a typical drink
00:01:05 I am from Colima I live in Colima and there is
00:01:09 a delicious drink that everyone can
00:01:13 drink, children and adults, and its name is
00:01:16 tuba. What about the tuba? It is my
00:01:21 favorite
00:01:24 tuba to begin
00:01:27 with.  a serum is a
00:01:31 serum that comes out of a palm tree a
00:01:35 very interesting fact is that colima is known
00:01:38 as the city of palm trees the city
00:01:41 of palm trees is better known as
00:01:45 colima because it is a city full of
00:01:48 palm trees and the coconut palm trees remain
00:01:51 how the tuba is produced
00:01:55 consists of making a small hole in
00:01:58 the palm in the trunk of the palm
00:02:02 once this
00:02:05 hole is made a kind of cone is left that makes
00:02:09 all the serum and all the  palm juice
00:02:12 starts to come out it
00:02:14 starts to come out it is left for approximately
00:02:18 two weeks 15 days until
00:02:23 all the palm serum comes out and once
00:02:26 a liquid has collected that is the base
00:02:30 of the grave the grave there are two ways to
00:02:34 take the  natural tuba and
00:02:39 composite tuba the natural tuba is white and the
00:02:44 composite tuba is red and now the question
00:02:49 that we have all been asking ourselves is
00:02:52 a natural alcoholic drink well
00:02:55 let me tell you that if it is it is a
00:02:58 fermented drink
00:03:00 which means that if it has a degree
00:03:04 of alcohol,
00:03:07 but don't worry, nothing happens, it really is
00:03:11 a very low degree of alcohol, you can
00:03:14 drink many tube glasses and the most
00:03:17 likely thing is that nothing will happen to you, maybe you
00:03:21 will get a little sleepy, but you won't really
00:03:25 see  as to get drunk so that's why
00:03:27 children can also drink this
00:03:30 fermented drink called tuba now
00:03:34 how the tuba is prepared how we prepare
00:03:37 the tuba is simply what comes out of the
00:03:40 palm well we don't really put more
00:03:44 things to the natural intake like  Its
00:03:47 name says it's natural, so it's only
00:03:51 what comes out of the palm tree, but the
00:03:55 composite tuba is prepared and right now I'm going
00:03:58 to explain how it's prepared. The first
00:04:02 step is to add fruit to the tuba. It's a
00:04:06 very cool drink. Take it with ice
00:04:11 Because in Colima it's very hot, very,
00:04:14 very hot in Colima, it's
00:04:16 always around
00:04:19 30 degrees, so the Tua is very
00:04:22 refreshing, so the first step to
00:04:25 prepare our tuba is to put ice in a
00:04:27 glass full of ice, then add the
00:04:31 whey that came out  the palm tree and then
00:04:34 the fruit begins the first step is the
00:04:38 strawberry the tuba has strawberry strawberry chopped
00:04:42 into small squares
00:04:45 delicious who does not love strawberries and more in
00:04:49 the tuba that is the first step  then
00:04:52 another fruit that also has the tuba is
00:04:55 the apple
00:04:57 delicious all chopped into
00:05:00 small pieces ok
00:05:04 and then additional to give it a bit
00:05:07 of texture to be able to feel it
00:05:12 when it's younger and to feel that
00:05:15 crunch the tuba also has cucumber
00:05:20 delicious all the fruit  What I'm
00:05:23 mentioning to you is chopped into small squares.
00:05:27 The joke about the tuba is that the
00:05:30 drink remains at the bottom and the fruit remains
00:05:33 floating on top, and if
00:05:37 this isn't super vicious, I'll still
00:05:41 tell you that the plus of the tuba is the
00:05:44 peanut.  Just as you listen to it,
00:05:48 we put peanuts in this delicious
00:05:51 Mexican drink. It is an ancestral drink. It
00:05:54 is a drink that our ancestors tried and made,
00:05:58 and this drink has been evolving
00:06:01 for years, so the
00:06:05 final touch is the
00:06:09 peanuts. Thinking about it makes my mouth water.
00:06:12 once you have your glass
00:06:15 with ice you go you fruit and your
00:06:17 peanuts all you have to do
00:06:20 is enjoy it you can go downtown
00:06:23 you can go  to your house with a tuba you can
00:06:27 say with your friends for an act at
00:06:29 any time you can have a
00:06:32 tuba and if the effect is an
00:06:34 alcoholic drink but it is an alcoholic drink
00:06:37 let's say that it is very harmless that
00:06:41 anyone can drink so now
00:06:44 I ask you  what is the
00:06:47 typical drink of your country
00:06:49 how they drink it how they prepare it how is
00:06:53 the alcoholic drink of your country or what
00:06:56 is your favorite drink tell me in the

00:00:05 Hello, how are you? My name is Tamara and I'm from
00:00:10 Mexico City and today I'm going to talk
00:00:13 about one of my favorite topics,
00:00:19 food,
00:00:22 and one of my favorite foods, which
00:00:25 is tacos.
00:00:28 Tacos are
00:00:32 food that is what  it is consumed more
00:00:35 in mexico there are many types of tacos
00:00:40 [Music]
00:00:42 the most important thing about a taco is that it is
00:00:45 in a tortilla that is an
00:00:48 essential element that has to be in a taco
00:00:50 because you will find many
00:00:53 types of tacos in mexico depending on the state  from
00:00:57 the province of the area of ​​the country that you
00:01:00 visit or that you are in the tacos are
00:01:03 different
00:01:05 but what cannot be missing in a taco
00:01:07 for any reason
00:01:10 a tortilla for you the tortillas
00:01:16 the tortillas are like
00:01:19 a very flattened circular piece of dough
00:01:23 very flat very thin
00:01:26 and they make the dough they make the tortilla and
00:01:30 they put it on a griddle which is a
00:01:32 kind of pan that you put on the fire and
00:01:36 then this is the tortilla and then
00:01:38 that dough is cooked
00:01:41 and it is made of corn
00:01:44 but well first let's talk about the tacos
00:01:47 then we go with the tortilla
00:01:50 the tacos
00:01:54 there is a version of the tacos that became
00:01:57 famous in the United States which is the taco
00:02:01 as a hard tortilla in taco bell and they
00:02:05 are there as different things but in
00:02:09 reality the tacos that I like the most are  the
00:02:12 tacos de pastor which is a small
00:02:15 tortilla about this size
00:02:20 that they add pork meat that is
00:02:23 like in a top and then the taco maker
00:02:25 until the person who prepares the
00:02:28 tacos cuts pieces of meat from a
00:02:32 log of meat that is turning  and
00:02:34 down there there is like a fire that is
00:02:37 cooking it and it is cooking it this is the
00:02:39 taco maker cuts the pieces of meat
00:02:42 puts them on a griddle and the griddle
00:02:45 finishes sewing that pork meat they put it in
00:02:48 the taco they add a little onion
00:02:50 chopped a little cilantro
00:02:55 and a piece of pineapple that is on
00:02:59 top and then the taquero finishes
00:03:01 slicing the pineapple and puts it in the taco
00:03:04 then
00:03:07 they deliver your tacos you can order 23 I order
00:03:11 about 3 but some people order
00:03:13 five  tacos and even bullying people here
00:03:17 love tacos
00:03:19 and after you already have your tacos
00:03:24 on the table there are sliced ​​lemons so
00:03:28 you can squeeze the lemon on top and
00:03:31 then this is very important
00:03:34 there are different types of hot sauces
00:03:39 so there is green sauce there is red sauce
00:03:44 peanut sauce that is orange
00:03:46 there is guajillo chili sauce that is not
00:03:50 so spicy and is like brown brown
00:03:53 guajillo chili
00:03:55 all these sauces are prepared with
00:03:59 different vegetables generally garlic
00:04:02 onion tomato or tomato tomato that
00:04:06 is green tomato that is red
00:04:10 a  a little bit of salt and chili
00:04:14 we have a huge variety of chili peppers in
00:04:18 mexico
00:04:20 oh chile habanero which is one of the
00:04:22 spiciest if you eat a
00:04:25 habanero chili sauce you can start to
00:04:28 cry it is normal to see people crying
00:04:30 in taco shops in mexico proches in chile
00:04:34 With a sauce, I personally don't
00:04:38 eat much chili, so when the
00:04:40 sauce was made, my tacos tried to add a few
00:04:43 drops to avoid suffering too much, but it's
00:04:48 rich in chilar be good to mexicans
00:04:52 we like chileans a little bit and you
00:04:55 start to cry and snot starts to come out
00:04:56 of your nose and then you have to
00:04:59 drink a lot of water but i'm going to give you the
00:05:04 secret recipe to cut an
00:05:08 enchilada when you start to feel  silage a
00:05:11 lot you grab the salt shaker you put it you put
00:05:14 a little salt in your hand and you eat it
00:05:18 and the salt makes you calm down
00:05:21 a bit
00:05:23 that's the itching you get with a
00:05:27 very spicy sauce even in mexico there are people
00:05:31 who grab  the raw chiles while he
00:05:34 is eating and slowly and he bites them
00:05:36 then he eats while he bites the
00:05:38 chiles
00:05:40 he has a great love
00:05:43 for chili and for the spiciness it is really part of
00:05:47 our cuisine
00:05:49 and
00:05:51 well there are tacos also from the basket which
00:05:58 is also a small tortilla  and
00:06:00 inside they can take beans or potatoes or
00:06:05 chicharrón chicharrón is something that comes out
00:06:08 of the pig too
00:06:12 and well these little cubes are
00:06:14 folded like this and passed through oil and they put
00:06:18 several in a basket they close the basket
00:06:21 with  n a towel and they take it away and then they
00:06:26 take it to sell but then these
00:06:28 tacos stay warm
00:06:30 so they can put it on any
00:06:32 corner at any crossroads
00:06:38 and they have this basket to carry the
00:06:40 tacos that are very nicely woven
00:06:43 and they take out the go pack and  They serve it to you there on
00:06:47 the street and you can eat it
00:06:49 and
00:06:50 [Music]
00:06:52 but there are also taquerías that are
00:06:55 structures built where they
00:06:58 sell pastor tacos, there are also
00:07:01 steak tacos, which is
00:07:03 very finely chopped beef
00:07:06 and this one and they put it on  in the taco well in the
00:07:09 tortilla so that is your taco and the
00:07:12 technique to eat tacos is to grab the
00:07:15 tortilla with both hands bow your
00:07:19 head and bite the taco that is the
00:07:22 technique to eat a taco
00:07:28 there is something very curious that we also
00:07:31 do  something called quesadillas,
00:07:35 for example, you can go to a stall, well,
00:07:38 like in a market, there are
00:07:43 food stalls
00:07:46 [Music]
00:07:47 and there are ladies who make tortillas,
00:07:51 how good they do with corn  they
00:07:53 grind it and make the tortilla dough and
00:07:57 then later they can make the
00:07:58 tortillas by hand they make them this
00:08:00 way or they can take a little ball of
00:08:03 dough put it in a
00:08:06 tortilla press and crush it and then
00:08:09 almost into the tortilla with a  machine but
00:08:11 the tastiest are the ones that the ladies make by hand
00:08:14 and then they
00:08:17 turn them over like that and then a round tortilla is made they
00:08:19 throw it on the griddle
00:08:23 and since there is yellow corn white
00:08:27 corn red corn there is blue corn there is corn of
00:08:32 many  colors there may be
00:08:35 blue tortillas white tortillas
00:08:38 yellow tortillas and they taste different I
00:08:41 love blue tortillas
00:08:45 but hey then you go to a
00:08:47 quesadilla stand
00:08:49 and they put a tortilla and they can
00:08:51 put some chicken meat on it and they close it
00:08:55 and you would say good it is  a tortilla with
00:08:58 meat is a taco but it is not a
00:09:01 quesadilla and I cannot explain
00:09:04 why we make this difference and how
00:09:08 we know what a quesadilla is and
00:09:10 what a taco is but  That's right, we know that
00:09:15 a quesadilla is very
00:09:17 different and a taco is very different.
00:09:20 Quesadillas can also have a
00:09:23 bit of cheese. Mushroom
00:09:27 quesadillas.
00:09:36 the pumpkins and
00:09:39 here we eat them
00:09:41 mushroom quesadillas chicken
00:09:44 quesadillas potato quesadillas
00:09:50 we also put sauce on the
00:09:53 quesadillas I don't put lemon on the quesadillas there are
00:09:56 people who do but in general the
00:09:58 quesadilla is simply with sauce and in
00:10:01 some places they put a little bit of
00:10:03 cream of milk and cheese sprinkled yes, that
00:10:07 is, it is the quesadilla, how can that be
00:10:10 melted
00:10:13 and sometimes they put cream and another type of
00:10:16 cheese sprinkled on it,
00:10:18 that is, it is a tortilla with cream cheese and
00:10:22 more than that, that is, a lot of dairy products, a
00:10:27 lot of vegetables, a lot of corn and a lot  Chile
00:10:33 there are also tacos dorados, which is a
00:10:36 tortilla that you add chicken, papa,
00:10:41 or beans, roll it up and make a
00:10:44 kind of cylinder.  or long and you put it in
00:10:49 a pot full of
00:10:52 oil, fry it and then you make several
00:10:57 taquitos you put them on a plate you add
00:11:00 cream you add grated cheese you add
00:11:03 salsa you put some chopped lettuce on
00:11:05 top
00:11:08 and that is a dish called tacos
00:11:10 dorados and tacos dorados are another
00:11:13 type of taco that exists in Mexico
00:11:16 we have already seen tacos de pastor tacos dorados
00:11:19 tacos de canasta quesadillas and well I
00:11:23 could spend another 20 minutes talking
00:11:26 about everything that is done with corn dough
00:11:30 to make tortillas because there are
00:11:33 many other things that we can do
00:11:37 with corn and eat and I'm already very
00:11:41 hungry talking about this but hey
00:11:47 I hope you have been craving a lot and
00:11:50 if one day
00:11:52 everyone dares to eat some tacos
00:11:54 always try to have it in a place
00:11:58 With running water, let's say it's an
00:12:01 established place or if you have a
00:12:03 Mexican friend, take them to a
00:12:06 place that you know is clean
00:12:08 because
00:12:10 there are places that aren't clean
00:12:12 and you can get sick  It has happened to me
00:12:14 so you have to be very careful and
00:12:18 careful where you eat tacos but do not
00:12:22 stop doing it because they are delicious and
00:12:25 watery with the sauce
00:12:27 if you ask the waiter if it is
00:12:30 spicy and he tells you that it is not spicy
00:12:32 try it anyway because many  Sometimes
00:12:35 for a Mexican who eats a lot of chili it
00:12:37 doesn't bite anymore but for someone who eats a
00:12:40 little bit of chili it does bite a lot so
00:12:42 always try a drop and if you have
00:12:44 enchiladas
00:12:46 you know salt in your hand
00:12:50 and at a good pace
00:12:54 well that's how it all went see you later bye
00:13:01 [Music]
00:13:03 ah

224,"00:00:00 and even franco died
00:00:04 but later after the dictatorship
00:00:08 how we got to the current democracy was it
00:00:13 easy or was it
00:00:15 difficult today we are going to see it and maybe there will be
00:00:20 some surprise
00:00:25 [Music]
00:00:28 hello well yes in
00:00:33 1975 franco dies and
00:00:38 things start to happen the
00:00:42 transition to democracy
00:00:45 at that time there were three options the
00:00:50 first option was to continue the
00:00:54 same political system they followed the
00:00:57 same laws the head of state instead of
00:01:01 being frank became the king king
00:01:05 juan carlos first king juan carlos
00:01:07 juan carlos first  The second option,
00:01:11 which is to radically end Franco's regime,
00:01:14 break the regime up to
00:01:18 now and do something completely
00:01:21 different, and then the third option, which
00:01:25 is an intermediate point, is to gradually change
00:01:29 the current regime and gradually change the
00:01:32 laws to achieve democracy.
00:01:36 King Juan Carlos first
00:01:40 advocated option C for not breaking
00:01:43 completely but moving towards
00:01:46 democracy so at that time the
00:01:49 president  e was arias navarro
00:01:52 arias navarro arias navarro he wanted the
00:01:55 option to he wanted to continue the same but
00:01:59 society in general wanted changes there were
00:02:02 many
00:02:04 demonstrations there were many strikes
00:02:06 many people who wanted to stop
00:02:11 working to put pressure on and
00:02:14 the opposition parties the parties
00:02:17 against  the dictatorship of the Franco regime
00:02:20 they were more and more active they did more
00:02:23 things and meanwhile eta continued with the
00:02:28 terrorism etap which was the
00:02:31 terrorist group in favor
00:02:34 of the independence of the
00:02:37 basque country and for all this arias navarro
00:02:41 resigns he ceases to be  president then
00:02:45 the king appoints adolfo suárez the
00:02:48 next president is adolfo suárez
00:02:52 so adolfo suárez already
00:02:55 worked for the dictatorship before he already worked
00:02:58 with the Franco regime but he saw the
00:03:03 change in society and
00:03:06 began to take steps towards the transition
00:03:09 made it legal  the right of assembly to
00:03:13 groups of people to meet without having
00:03:16 to ask for permission to associate  With the creation
00:03:20 of associations of different types of
00:03:23 demonstrations so that people could
00:03:25 demonstrate on the streets in
00:03:28 public places, he also
00:03:31 released many political prisoners
00:03:33 from Franco's regime out of jail and began
00:03:37 talks with the psoe and
00:03:41 with the communist party that their  The leaders
00:03:44 were Felipe González
00:03:48 Carrillo, so in
00:03:52 1976 a political reform was carried out,
00:03:56 the shape of the state was changed, a bicameral system was created, a
00:04:00 two-
00:04:03 chamber system with a congress and a senate, which
00:04:07 is the system that continues
00:04:10 today where all the laws  they are elected by
00:04:13 vote, new laws must always be voted on
00:04:16 so the deputies the
00:04:19 government of that time
00:04:21 approves this change and a
00:04:24 referendum was held a
00:04:27 referendum was held where citizens could
00:04:31 vote to say if they agreed or
00:04:34 not with  this change and the xi came out 94
00:04:39 percent of the people
00:04:42 agreed to make it a
00:04:44 democratic system  So, after this,
00:04:48 elections are held, a vote is held
00:04:50 to choose who will be the members of
00:04:54 Congress.
00:04:55 Meanwhile, ETA continues with its
00:04:58 activities and there is also
00:05:01 violent violence by members of the extreme
00:05:04 right against ETA and other types of
00:05:07 violence, so at this moment it is
00:05:11 legalized.  the communist party makes
00:05:13 the communist party legal this to the
00:05:17 military the army
00:05:20 did not like it well and the Francoists who
00:05:23 were in favor of Franco did
00:05:25 not like it either then in
00:05:29 1977 the general elections
00:05:32 of the government were held and  in the
00:05:35 elections ucedé won, the union of
00:05:40 the democratic center won, which is the party of
00:05:43 adolfo suárez, then adolfo suárez
00:05:45 was still the president, number 2
00:05:48 was the socialist party, then the
00:05:51 communist party and then the popular alliance, they
00:05:54 won in this order, but it
00:05:58 happens, they did not win much,
00:06:01 there was  to make pacts to be able to
00:06:02 govern then during this time
00:06:06 some pacts are already made to  combating the
00:06:10 economic crisis some
00:06:12 problems of the economic crisis that
00:06:15 existed in spain were solved also at this time
00:06:18 adolfo suárez began to promote
00:06:21 autonomies the autonomous communities
00:06:25 which is what ended up being done spain
00:06:28 ended up dividing into
00:06:30 autonomous communities not then in
00:06:34 1978 it was approved  the constitution the
00:06:39 spanish constitution that is still
00:06:42 in force today with few changes
00:06:44 so this constitution is approved
00:06:48 with a referendum too and they approved it
00:06:51 the majority of spaniards voted in favor
00:06:53 so this constitution
00:06:56 says that spain is a social state and a
00:07:01 state that cares
00:07:04 of its citizens, not including the right
00:07:08 to housing, for example, then how it is
00:07:11 applied in practice is something else,
00:07:13 but it mentions different rights
00:07:17 that all people have and defines the
00:07:19 state as a democratic state defines
00:07:22 the country as a parliamentary monarchy
00:07:25 is a  monarchy has a king but the king
00:07:29 has no power to make law  That is to
00:07:33 say, which laws can be created and which
00:07:36 laws cannot, which laws can be approved, which
00:07:39 laws do not, does not have those powers and it is a
00:07:41 parliamentary country in
00:07:44 which we choose our representatives in
00:07:46 the government and they are then the ones who
00:07:48 make the decisions.  laws and tests and they
00:07:51 approve them also says that Spain is an
00:07:54 indivisible country that cannot be separated
00:07:57 into several countries and also recognizes the
00:08:00 right to autonomy defines certain
00:08:04 autonomies as
00:08:08 traditionally
00:08:10 autonomous regions with cultural rights let's say
00:08:13 separate that can automatically
00:08:16 create their  own laws and create what we
00:08:20 call the autonomy statute, which is
00:08:23 a treaty on the relationship that
00:08:26 the community has with the country and certain
00:08:29 regions that automatically receive
00:08:31 this autonomy treaty, such as Catalonia,
00:08:34 the Basque Country, Galicia, Andalusia, perhaps,
00:08:38 Andalusia, I am not sure, and the  other
00:08:41 communities also have the option of
00:08:44 making this statute of autonomy if they
00:08:47 decide if  the community decides it
00:08:50 wants this extra measure of
00:08:53 autonomy no then the king is recognized
00:08:58 as the head of state and as the head of
00:09:01 the armed forces of the army in
00:09:05 practice i don't know if that actually
00:09:08 applies in any concrete way that i
00:09:11 know of today in  day the king does not influence the
00:09:14 military actions of the Spanish army
00:09:17 so I do not know if it is more a
00:09:19 symbolic title than anything, but I do know that
00:09:23 the king appears in military parades and
00:09:27 in public events related to him
00:09:29 with the Spanish army with the
00:09:31 constitution the  death penalty the
00:09:35 death penalty ceases to exist
00:09:37 capital punishment and the state
00:09:40 becomes a secular state in a
00:09:43 non-denominational state in a non-
00:09:46 religious state the state in theory according to the
00:09:49 constitution becomes disconnected
00:09:52 from religion disconnected from the
00:09:54 Catholic religion  that until then it was just
00:09:57 another part of the state, in fact there are
00:10:00 still connections and there are still
00:10:02 special cases and special laws for
00:10:06 churches.  a catholic but according to the
00:10:09 constitution the state is secular and
00:10:12 should not affect the religion of the state
00:10:15 and decision making no so the
00:10:18 constitution also establishes the
00:10:21 freedom of the press that newspapers
00:10:23 can publish the news without
00:10:27 first having to go through a sensor for a
00:10:29 State censorship also creates the
00:10:32 right to strike, people are allowed to
00:10:35 strike, stop working to
00:10:38 exert pressure, and the government is separated into three
00:10:41 branches, three branches that are independent in principle,
00:10:44 three powers, which is the
00:10:46 legislative power to create or eliminate
00:10:50 laws.  executive power, which is the
00:10:53 government, are the administrations, the
00:10:57 ministries that decide how government policy is going to be
00:10:59 applied, how
00:11:02 money is going to be spent, etc., and the
00:11:05 judicial power,
00:11:07 the judges who apply the laws and
00:11:10 sentences if
00:11:13 someone does  illegal things not then
00:11:16 after approving the constitution they
00:11:20 go back to make general votes
00:11:24 and again win ad  olfo suárez
00:11:27 but now it is not so clear that adolfo
00:11:31 suárez has the capacity to govern
00:11:34 by the result because there were also
00:11:38 municipal votes of the municipalities
00:11:41 of the cities and towns of Spain and the
00:11:45 psoe won much more in catalonia and
00:11:49 the basque country lost adolfo suárez and they
00:11:53 won  the nationalists of each region
00:11:57 then in
00:12:00 1979 there was also a crisis a crisis
00:12:05 due to the price of oil unemployment
00:12:07 rose a lot the number of people without work rose a lot
00:12:10 and the activity of eta also worsened there
00:12:14 began to be more
00:12:17 diet activity so this created tensions
00:12:20 even within  Within the party of one
00:12:24 of them, there began to be different
00:12:25 opinions,
00:12:26 different opinions on foreign policy
00:12:29 , on dealing with
00:12:31 foreigners with other countries, and the
00:12:34 president had less and less
00:12:37 support, fewer people who supported him, and
00:12:40 it became more difficult, well, to carry the situation.
00:12:43 in charge of the government then
00:12:46 felipe gonzález of the psoe
00:12:49 takes advantage of this to make a motion of
00:12:53 censure  sura a motion of no confidence is a
00:12:57 debate and a vote in the government
00:13:00 to decide whether to remove the
00:13:03 president of the government so this
00:13:07 motion of no confidence fails
00:13:10 but only the debate that is shown
00:13:13 on television and such makes felipe
00:13:17 gonzález
00:13:18 and more  popularity among the citizens
00:13:21 then there is more and more pressure and
00:13:26 in 1981 in 1981 adolfo suárez resigns he
00:13:30 leaves he says I am leaving I am no longer president
00:13:34 so the president becomes
00:13:36 leopoldo calvo-sotelo but at the time
00:13:40 he was being replaced that
00:13:43 the new president was being approved there is
00:13:46 an attempted coup d'état a soldier
00:13:50 Antonio Tejero Antonio Tejero enters
00:13:55 the congress and kidnaps the
00:13:58 congressmen while this was happening
00:14:01 in valencia in valencia the army took out
00:14:05 tanks into the streets and in madrid
00:14:09 radio stations were occupied  and on
00:14:11 television this coup failed the
00:14:15 king opposed the coup
00:14:18 and apparently had contacts with other
00:14:21 government generals with
00:14:24 Sorry other army generals for
00:14:27 not joining this coup d'état and
00:14:30 two days later Calvo
00:14:33 Sotelo finally named him as president but
00:14:36 his party happened to be more and more
00:14:40 unstable and the PSOE was getting
00:14:45 stronger and in 1900
00:14:49 1982 again  elections are held and the
00:14:53 psoe wins wins with an absolute majority wins
00:14:57 more than half of the seats in
00:15:02 congress many consider the normalization
00:15:06 of democracy the moment it is
00:15:10 proven that the government
00:15:13 that was not simply a continuation
00:15:17 of Francoism can be changed  but pretending
00:15:21 that it was a democracy when in
00:15:25 truth it was not, but if it really
00:15:27 was a democracy the government could
00:15:30 change and other parties could be elected,
00:15:32 then the
00:15:36 transition period is considered from 1975 to
00:15:40 1982 and this marks the  moment in which
00:15:45 Spain will be able to integrate much more
00:15:48 into the rest of the European democracies and
00:15:52 be considered more or less an equal with
00:15:55 the other p  European countries and
00:15:59 the series on the history of Spain ends here'

00:03:35 this happens to me with spiders also
00:03:37 with cesc spiders when I've been to
00:03:41 Asia but I haven't seen any
00:03:45 spider like this very big and many colors
00:03:49 as I don't know I don't know I have
00:03:52 to be afraid  You don't know if spiders can bite you, they
00:03:54 can also have
00:03:57 poison, it's the same as snakes
00:03:59 from the outside, it was said no, what decoration
00:04:01 in
00:04:11 Taiwan?  of colors of israel
00:04:15 yellow or with the color red and
00:04:19 really scared I don't know if above all or not if it
00:04:22 is red the red animals the
00:04:26 black and yellow animals often have
00:04:29 exact poison they have poison and it is c  True, they
00:04:33 are dangerous, yes, yes, and
00:04:37 you are afraid of bees
00:04:41 if they stung only once and once in
00:04:45 your life
00:04:46 a wasp actually not one leaves a
00:04:48 room a
00:04:52 sight I was stung once by a
00:04:55 bee I don't know  It did sting me and it did hurt
00:04:58 but now I do see a bee okay
00:05:04 I'm careful I'm not clear that
00:05:07 I'm not going to hit it too fast but I don't
00:05:11 run away I mean I don't have it much much
00:05:14 better I have I have a friend than
00:05:16 when  a bee sees her friend a
00:05:19 girl humanity when a bee
00:05:21 has to say maria maria maria maria
00:05:25 maria maria three times because it
00:05:28 belongs to her so you let her go it
00:05:32 's a superstition she thinks that mariana
00:05:35 the mother of jesus de aguas three times the
00:05:39 Aleja takes
00:05:45 ours I didn't know that there were people who
00:05:48 believed that,
00:05:50 Maria Maria Maria,
00:05:53 what else are there fears? There are people, there are many
00:05:57 people who are afraid of planes,
00:06:00 true
00:06:02 of planes, yes, you were afraid
00:06:06 of planes, no, but it's just that  As a child, I
00:06:09 had taken planes  As a
00:06:11 child, yes, I had already taken planes and
00:06:13 I suppose I was used to it. I
00:06:15 have never thought what would happen if, of course, I
00:06:19 think that children see that their
00:06:23 parents do something and they are not afraid, of
00:06:25 course, they are not
00:06:27 exactly afraid either, that is to say.  But for example,
00:06:30 there are people who are afraid of dogs,
00:06:35 true of dogs,
00:06:40 but the people I know who add
00:06:45 fear of dogs is because their parents,
00:06:47 their father, their mother, also one of the
00:06:51 interesting dogs, so they have
00:06:53 seen a dog that is afraid or what.  Fear of course,
00:06:57 well, that or a dog bit the LEDs, not
00:07:01 those older than a year. There are also people who,
00:07:03 when they were little, were bitten by a dog
00:07:06 and later, it is always true, they
00:07:10 are afraid and it is a pity with
00:07:13 airplanes something similar can also happen.
00:07:18 I have a friend my
00:07:21 friend he had taken many many
00:07:24 planes he had gone by plane
00:07:26 well a few times but once the
00:07:29 plane made a noise
00:07:32 and the captain also said through the public address system
00:07:37 there is a problem we have to go
00:07:40 back to the airport from to the airport they
00:07:44 had to go back
00:07:48 and nothing happens they came back and landed but
00:07:52 then my
00:07:55 friend started to get stressed and the next
00:07:59 flight more and the next time he picked up a
00:08:02 plane more and more and yes every time  He was more
00:08:05 afraid yes yes yes it is a problem and since
00:08:09 then he has returned to take
00:08:11 planes but but he always has to be
00:08:15 scared he has to take something what
00:08:17 if he doesn't I don't know but it's something involuntary it's not
00:08:21 something he thinks he's going to  fall
00:08:23 I don't know if you can't avoid it it is if you
00:08:26 can't avoid it you here like
00:08:29 scary movies I like them
00:08:33 yes yes you like movies
00:08:36 no hollywood movies for a
00:08:38 scary scary blog if there is or  No, I wasn't
00:08:44 very scared but when I was little,
00:08:47 yes, I was very scared, I think the
00:08:51 other way around, I think it was more scary
00:08:53 now that it doesn't happen when I was little, not me,
00:08:57 but you were afraid of the dark,
00:09:00 but I don't know why I didn't think  I thought
00:09:06 this happens in  television and at least
00:09:08 for different people, it was real,
00:09:11 I didn't get into the movie, yes,
00:09:14 I once saw the movie it about the clown
00:09:21 [Music]
00:09:23 that night I couldn't sleep without being very afraid,
00:09:30 no, I don't like them very much, I like the ones with a
00:09:33 lot  scared but it's a very fair dog that
00:09:36 's it but I don't like the
00:09:38 scary movies that you have there all the
00:09:40 time a lot of tension that you're
00:09:42 so tense for a while I don't like it if it was bad
00:09:45 what a movie not like there are one or more
00:09:48 shows and it's what  it happened badly in a new
00:09:52 show I enjoy no I don't like them and which ones
00:09:55 do they like
00:09:56 for example drag me to hell drag me to
00:10:00 hell or I don't know her they are movies so
00:10:08 scary that many people are afraid of them
00:10:11 and the heights are the very high places  that
00:10:15 I was never afraid of them no I don't have as
00:10:18 much as I used to like to
00:10:20 fly up if you liked he didn't like to
00:10:24 climb trees he loved trees
00:10:30 to me too no one I think that the two of
00:10:33 us are very brave and
00:10:36 courageous me as a child  I lived in  a
00:10:40 block a block of flats
00:10:44 on the floor 10 cm on the tenth floor so when
00:10:49 I was little I was used to
00:10:52 seeing clearly through the balcony to look through the
00:10:55 balcony from a very high place of course I
00:10:57 was used to being in the mountains or
00:10:59 walking and the  trees of course
00:11:02 it was also a lot of fun here near
00:11:06 barcelona there is a theme park
00:11:07 hit i guess if there is an
00:11:11 amusement park amusement park
00:11:14 have you been on the ride on the
00:11:16 free fall ride to one that you
00:11:21 fall down exactly not  no no it
00:11:24 's not very cool because I went to
00:11:26 portaventura yes I went when I was little when I
00:11:31 was little yes it's been years
00:11:34 I haven't been to portaventura
00:11:37 yes there is now mind now there is an
00:11:38 attraction you go up very high you see the
00:11:43 whole park and then
00:11:46 directly no no I have not seen it
00:11:50 too much but I have ridden in
00:11:53 similar attractions attractions similar to this one
00:11:55 in Japan and more united
00:11:58 I remember I remember once in London
00:12:01 in London there is one and more  It's scary
00:12:07 because you don't know when arriving here
00:12:11 waiting waiting waiting and when
00:12:14 you fall
00:12:17 in the month raised here at the fair
00:12:21 I think a lot of warning words were created
00:12:24 but also giving the impression the
00:12:27 sensation in the barrel César Díaz
00:12:30 impresses a bit set yes  but I like it
00:12:34 I like it later again again
00:12:36 I want to go back up again because I have
00:12:39 to go to portaventura
00:12:41 because I like it it doesn't scare me funny
00:12:45 but it's also fear it's fun it's
00:12:49 again again I thought of one thing
00:12:54 I don't like they are  the needles when
00:12:58 you go to the doctor the needles no no I do not see
00:13:01 these injections no injection or
00:13:06 or the blood tests have to
00:13:09 prick a needle a syringe
00:13:13 and the needles the needles do not give me
00:13:16 the impression that for some and for the
00:13:20 analysis still  but I remember the thing
00:13:23 but an analysis the needle is
00:13:26 here for a while a certain time I was
00:13:30 thinking to myself
00:13:31 about the only time I've gotten dizzy what an
00:13:34 eye I only think I got dizzy allegedly once
00:13:37 z and I paid they put me into acupuncture
00:13:41 acupuncture and of course the needles are not like
00:13:44 the needles are like that they are very small or more
00:13:46 with a point or exact
00:13:51 but they leave them there leave them you see that
00:13:55 your body is full of
00:13:57 motor hardware medium impression and you get dizzy
00:14:00 he asked in that man he asked me
00:14:02 are you dizzy and I said no because I
00:14:05 had never been dizzy I would not be you
00:14:10 saw blood oh no no there is no blood no
00:14:13 no you can't see the blood
00:14:17 and all over your body
00:14:19 you had a needle exactly from the women and
00:14:21 how it has been  who has done acupuncture
00:14:24 but of course people who are afraid
00:14:27 of needles acupuncture is impossible it
00:14:30 is not that I think many people who are
00:14:34 afraid of needle bazaars new
00:14:36 syringes from vaccines
00:14:39 from blood tests that take a
00:14:41 lot of blood if it is  Well, I think that
00:14:45 's it, we can't leave you defending yourself here,
00:14:47 it's
00:14:48 been a very stressful time since we talked about many
00:14:52 things that scares me the most here
00:14:56 are psychopaths with axes and
00:15:00 when I see that we have the  two
00:15:06 so thank you for joining us and
00:15:09 you who are afraid to
00:15:12 write it below in the comments if
00:15:15 you are afraid of me
00:15:18 writing it write what comes until
00:15:22 another goodbye

00:00:41 will pass Because some of us two
00:00:43 have to win the Championship it's
00:00:46 not exactly like that exactly Either you or I
00:00:50 have to win this championship
00:00:52 so  Well, Justin, you're going to start
00:00:56 by asking me the questions and I
00:00:59 'm going to write them down. Yes,
00:01:03 come on, come on, come on, what is your first question? Is
00:01:05 your character real or fictitious? They
00:01:14 are yes or no questions. Yes or no.
00:01:18 It can only be either real or
00:01:21 fictitious, there are no other options Well, yes, he is
00:01:24 a real character Exactly, he is a
00:01:29 real character, your character is a man,
00:01:34 no, OK I imagine that yes,
00:01:38 your character is a singer
00:01:43 No, he is not a singer  Well let's ask what is
00:01:48 classic, your character Is an actress yes
00:01:55 Ok a woman your character
00:02:00 is alive
00:02:03 Yes my character is alive
00:02:06 your character
00:02:08 is I am already assuming Obviously that your character is
00:02:11 a woman
00:02:13 this woman Is from Europe no
00:02:18 she is not European Ok this woman is from the
00:02:23 United States  Yes she is from the United
00:02:26 States Although an actress from the United
00:02:30 States
00:02:31 this
00:02:33 actress is famous for appearing in series Yes
00:02:38 yes Ok
00:02:41 this series is a series is a sitcom
00:02:47 yes
00:02:49 God is just the way it is Friends
00:02:57 no with that question there is a 90%
00:03:04 probability of
00:03:07 I'm going to give you a clue
00:03:10 and I'm going to tell you that
00:03:15 people sometimes do more than one job
00:03:20 throughout our lives, okay, I already
00:03:25 imagined it a bit because they make him
00:03:27 answer if she was an actress,
00:03:30 but
00:03:32 already at the  knowing about the sitcom really
00:03:35 the only sitcom I've seen is Friends
00:03:39 Yes yes So if she's not on Friends it's going
00:03:45 to be very difficult for me to know her
00:03:48 maybe you know her through something other than
00:03:52 psycho
00:03:53 Well let's try to guess  r the other
00:03:57 job she her other job was in the
00:04:01 artistic field
00:04:03 she was not a cook or she does not have Well
00:04:10 I told you that she is not in the artistic field
00:04:12 because what she already does is not
00:04:16 artistic Maybe you have another way of
00:04:18 asking me that because yes Well  I don't know, she's not
00:04:23 a cook, she's not an artist. Ok,
00:04:26 because of what you're saying, maybe it
00:04:29 's because she's someone from
00:04:31 production, it could be.
00:04:39 I'm not super lost, super super
00:04:43 lost, I'll try to find a
00:04:45 physical characteristic that will help me, this
00:04:47 woman.
00:04:53 that
00:04:58 her iconic look is with brown hair
00:05:03 she is not blonde yes you told me
00:05:09 she is from the United States No yes Ok God
00:05:14 let's try more to think about her profile
00:05:18 this woman is over 30
00:05:23 yes she is over 30
00:05:27 one but  that is no longer because it
00:05:31 fits with everything except for the fact that she is
00:05:33 alive because she died last year
00:05:36 who is that person that you So
00:05:39 this has not died but out of curiosity
00:05:41 Who is the one you were thinking about the thing
00:05:44 It's that not only did I find out about that
00:05:46 existence because I was very old and
00:05:48 then I found out about its existence because she
00:05:49 died. Oh, I don't remember the name.
00:05:52 Betty
00:05:54 is the one from the golden girls.
00:06:04 I found out
00:06:07 about her from news about her advanced
00:06:09 age
00:06:12 or something like that,
00:06:15 yes And this woman is not one of the
00:06:19 golden girls but she is an American woman She
00:06:22 had a sitcom but now you don't have
00:06:28 like that But maybe even more famous
00:06:32 now very famous in the United States  He is a
00:06:36 well-known character,
00:06:44 I am going to give you another clue, what clue
00:06:48 can I give you because I know that this is a
00:06:49 rather difficult character, that is, now,
00:06:51 thinking about it, it can be difficult to be
00:06:56 something more representative for people
00:07:00 a little older than me and it can
00:07:04 be  and that's why it's hard for me to locate it, it may
00:07:07 be, but it's a
00:08:23 piece of art, well, well, yes, you're right, I didn't want to, I didn't want to say that what I already stopped because it doesn't seem artistic to me
00:08:25 seems like entertainment, no, of course, of course, if
00:08:29 the  Did you know Eh yes
00:08:31 yes with a bit of a clue because she
00:08:34 really is much more famous now for
00:08:37 being a
00:08:40 presenter what made her very
00:08:43 famous was that's right with no that later she would
00:08:45 come out of the closet all that
00:08:48 [Applause]
00:08:50 very very strong Yes well yes well you have me
00:08:55 asked 18 questions Justin I think you are
00:08:58 going to beat me possibly But hey
00:09:01 let's go there Let's continue with your
00:09:04 character
00:09:10 Yeah well let's see what you bring
00:09:13 me
00:09:17 very easy but okay Okay you are going to
00:09:21 write down the questions for me Yes yes  Perfect
00:09:24 Okay, so let's start
00:09:26 and my first question is is it a real character?
00:09:30 No, it's not okay. It's an
00:09:38 animated character. What do you mean by animation? It
00:09:41 appears in series or movies of
00:09:46 good cartoons
00:09:49 or Pixar or something like that, to which you say it
00:09:52 can also  be a fictional character
00:09:54 but I could be referring to a
00:09:55 fictional character from a movie No, of
00:09:57 course, it
00:09:59 could be a character from a movie,
00:10:02 yes, from a titanic movie or something like that.
00:10:06 Oh, exactly, no, it's not a character from
00:10:08 animation animation okay is it a
00:10:12 character
00:10:14 for the whole family let's say for children or
00:10:17 for the whole family or is it a character
00:10:19 for adults that is it's a character for the
00:10:21 whole family Yes it's
00:10:24 okay it's a character
00:10:28 from a series it's
00:10:30 not okay then I assume it's a
00:10:33 character from  a movie unless it
00:10:36 's a character from a video game but
00:10:37 if it's from a video game I've already lost
00:10:39 So
00:10:43 if it's okay This animation and it could be from
00:10:46 a movie is a Disney movie
00:10:50 no
00:10:54 I'm not going to give you any help so you don't
00:10:57 leave  around because it's not from a
00:10:59 movie so you don't waste
00:11:02 questions trying to guess a
00:11:04 movie okay you told me that it's not from
00:11:06 a series also right
00:11:08 it's not from a series and it's not from a
00:11:11 movie and it's an animated character
00:11:13 yes
00:11:14 my goodness  It's a video game character, let's
00:11:18 not see how it's possible that it's from
00:11:22 animation and it's not in series or
00:11:24 movies or video games where
00:11:27 can an animation character be because
00:11:30 a comic is not animation a  comic that is
00:11:33 an illustration the drawing is not
00:11:35 animated yes
00:11:36 yes oh god how are we doing as your
00:11:41 question is that character is also
00:11:43 illustrated is a is a character from a
00:11:46 comic is not a character
00:11:51 is a character from some kind of book
00:11:54 is not a character  of animation that
00:11:57 is not in series that is not in movies
00:11:59 that are not in videogames we are going to say
00:12:02 that now today we are going to
00:12:06 say that it is more animation because
00:12:08 obviously everything is animated So I
00:12:12 told you that it was animation my goodness
00:12:16 Ay Ay Ay Ay  Oh, it's a character, the advertisement
00:12:19 of a brand, it's a character of a
00:12:22 brand, yes,
00:12:23 of a brand of food,
00:12:29 you
00:12:31 'll see, there are many, there are many animals in
00:12:35 the diet, how is the cereal tiger,
00:12:40 what animals are there in the diet, let's
00:12:43 see  that it be something international Of course
00:12:46 because you know it and I have to
00:12:48 know it
00:12:50 animals in food it is food it is
00:12:55 from a restaurant
00:12:56 it is not from a sweet
00:12:59 some product Sweet I don't know
00:13:04 I know that the I know that  You know her because she
00:13:07 is Google and she is present in Spain
00:13:11 So yes or yes you have to meet her to
00:13:14 see
00:13:17 How many questions have I had 12 you
00:13:20 still have a great chance of winning
00:13:24 I don't know
00:13:27 something about food but no but that
00:13:31 character you told me no  It's in
00:13:33 a series no no because
00:13:37 the Pink Panther comes to mind that there are some
00:13:40 Pink Panther cupcakes that are very
00:13:42 good But yes, it will be good there and here
00:13:45 No,
00:13:47 when you come to Spain you have to
00:13:50 try the Pink Panther cupcakes
00:13:53 I'll look for them I'll look for them clearly Let's see it
00:13:58 's from one Let's see it's from a meal that
00:14:03 isn't sweet but it's not a restaurant
00:14:06 therefore it's not a fast food
00:14:07 restaurant
00:14:11 And it's from a meal this food is eaten
00:14:18 I'm very lost
00:14:20 myself  I think that from your question it is
00:14:23 probably going to help you if you follow
00:14:26 that question that you were asking
00:14:28 this question this this
00:14:31 question no this animal this food this
00:14:34 food is eaten for breakfast yes this food is eaten for breakfast so it
00:14:42 can
00:14:46 It could be some cereals, it could be
00:14:48 bread, it could be Bimbo bread because the
00:14:52 Bimbo logo is a bear
00:14:56 and your question would be,
00:14:59 is it the bear of the Bimbo bread? Yes,
00:15:05 my
00:15:13 goodness.  because by the time you start, it's
00:15:15 already easy
00:15:20 complicated complicated the Bimbo bread bear
00:15:24 Yes because Besides, you don't even
00:15:26 see much anymore I remember the Bimbo bread bear
00:15:29 because maybe because I've seen it on the
00:15:32 internet when they talk about it
00:15:35 I think it's because of  I
00:15:38 understand that in many countries they are
00:15:40 eliminating animals from food,
00:15:43 animated animals. So really, the
00:15:46 new generation of people
00:15:47 will probably know about food
00:15:49 without these animals, whereas we did
00:15:52 grow up with them.
00:15:54 Exactly, I
00:15:56 do remember a video that Pablo made
00:16:00 recently.  where
00:16:02 where this Bimbo brand was mentioned and I
00:16:06 don't know if in that video the
00:16:08 Bimbo logo appears there with the bear or not but
00:16:12 but yes I don't know how I don't know how it
00:16:15 came to my mind because r  Actually no, you do
00:16:17 n't see that much Now when I was little
00:16:20 when I was little on TV yes
00:16:22 there were a lot of ads for Bimbo bread with
00:16:24 the teddy bear Yes but at least
00:16:27 now it's a character you can say it
00:16:30 's an animation character Because  almost
00:16:33 everything that appears is animated and they
00:16:35 animate it and do things to it of course Yes the
00:16:38 ads if there is an ad will always
00:16:40 be animated of course the bear Yes very good
00:16:44 Well it has been fun you had 14
00:16:48 questions so congratulations you made it
00:16:51 to the final thanks  thanks Well Justin
00:16:55 for the final if you have any idea of
00:16:58 a character that I should have there
00:17:01 to make it difficult for them you can tell me
00:17:06 I'm going to leave them private so that
00:17:08 it can't be filtered because
00:17:11 this side has to win this side
00:17:13 it carries all the legacy of Andrea
00:17:16 de Sofía and mine
00:17:18 Exactly very well

086,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about why having a
00:00:05 good accent having a good
00:00:07 pronunciation is very important
00:00:13 [Music]
00:00:16 Hello,
00:00:18 yes, today I am going to talk about accent
00:00:22 and pronunciation,
00:00:25 and the accent is a subject
00:00:28 that generates controversy, there is a lot of
00:00:31 controversy, a lot of discussion between  whether
00:00:35 or not it is important to have a good accent
00:00:41 and the reason why I think it is
00:00:44 important to have a good pronunciation to
00:00:46 have a good accent is so that you are
00:00:49 understood so that the person
00:00:52 you are speaking with understands you so that
00:00:54 the natives speak the language  that
00:00:57 you learn they understand you when you talk to
00:01:00 them so for there to be
00:01:04 communication the accent doesn't have to be
00:01:07 perfect you don't have to
00:01:11 imitate one hundred percent a native you don't have
00:01:15 to be confused with a native they
00:01:17 think you're Spanish or that you're  of
00:01:21 Hispanic America it is not necessary if it is
00:01:24 only for communication,
00:01:28 and it may be that some of you
00:01:31 want to reach a
00:01:35 very good level and speak  without an accent or with an
00:01:38 accent of a native person of a
00:01:41 native speaker
00:01:43 in my case I don't think it's very
00:01:46 important so the reason why I
00:01:50 think you have to have good
00:01:52 pronunciation is for communication
00:01:56 but hey maybe some of you will
00:02:00 tell me but Pablo I  when I talk to a
00:02:03 foreigner I understand him even if he has an
00:02:07 accent I understand him
00:02:11 and if up to a certain level up to a
00:02:13 certain point an accent is not a problem
00:02:16 but it is something gradual the
00:02:20 stronger the accent the more difficult it is to communicate
00:02:23 if the accent is strong enough  well you
00:02:29 can understand each other native speakers are
00:02:31 going to have to concentrate have to
00:02:34 think to see what it means but you
00:02:38 can communicate
00:02:40 but if what you are looking for is not just to
00:02:44 order a beer or ask where
00:02:47 the bathroom is but you really want to have
00:02:50 friends you have to have  friends in the country
00:02:53 or have a partner who speaks the language and
00:02:57 speak the language speak Spanish for
00:02:59 example with your partner then it is
00:03:04 more important to have  have a better accent
00:03:07 because your partner or your friends
00:03:11 if you make them think they have to be
00:03:13 concentrating always thinking to see
00:03:16 what that means then they get tired
00:03:19 they get very tired and you can't talk to
00:03:23 them for a long time in the end they say it doesn't matter
00:03:27 it doesn't matter let's see  netflix let's go see
00:03:29 a movie or something because it tires it a
00:03:32 lot so accent is not only
00:03:38 whether they understand you or not but
00:03:42 also how easily they understand you it
00:03:45 's a matter of making it easy for
00:03:48 the people who listen to you if you speak
00:03:52 with a better accent  they don't have to think
00:03:55 so much they don't have to concentrate so much
00:03:58 it's not that difficult it's not that difficult for
00:04:00 them to understand them
00:04:03 and accents well there are accents and accents
00:04:06 there are different types for example
00:04:11 a person from mexico comes to spain
00:04:14 we understand it we understand it
00:04:17 because we have heard spanish  from Mexico
00:04:20 several times maybe not not very much but
00:04:24 quite a lot we have heard the Spanish from Mexico a
00:04:26 lot
00:04:28 but if a person comes  from a country from
00:04:33 a country that is different,
00:04:36 for example, I have had problems
00:04:40 understanding people from China who have come to
00:04:43 Spain and speak Spanish and pronounce
00:04:47 some sounds
00:04:50 differently I do speak a lot if I speak a
00:04:53 lot with people who come from that
00:04:55 country I speak  a lot with people from china well
00:04:57 i get used to it i can get used to it
00:05:01 so if many people come from
00:05:05 that country well maybe maybe i got used to it
00:05:08 but if you come from a country or
00:05:11 you speak a language
00:05:14 what is another language it is not the language it is not
00:05:18 the accent that
00:05:21 People from that country are used to it, it's more difficult for them to
00:05:23 understand you, for example, with English,
00:05:26 not in England, in the US, there are also
00:05:32 people who come from India, they come
00:05:34 from India, and in English they have a different accent, they
00:05:37 have a different accent, and
00:05:40 me at first  When I met people
00:05:44 from India it was hard for me to
00:05:46 understand them but later
00:05:49 I got used to it and now it's
00:05:52 easier for me, it's not that hard for me but  If I meet
00:05:55 a person from another country I'm not
00:05:58 used to the language I know someone
00:06:00 from I don't know Burma or Nepal or something and
00:06:05 they speak to me with another accent it's very difficult
00:06:08 because I'm not used to that
00:06:10 accent
00:06:11 so it depends on the accent or not if you
00:06:15 speak  British English accent and
00:06:18 you go to the US, well, yes, they will surely understand you,
00:06:21 but if you go to the US and speak
00:06:26 English with a French accent, it will be more
00:06:30 difficult, it will be more difficult for them to understand you,
00:06:32 so even if it is only for
00:06:36 communication, I think it is good to
00:06:39 have a better accent  and I want to make
00:06:43 a distinction between an accent and
00:06:48 really mispronouncing mispronouncing
00:06:51 the words
00:06:53 what is mispronunciation is when
00:06:56 the sounds are confused when there are
00:07:00 sounds that are different in the language they
00:07:03 are separated but sometimes when
00:07:07 someone studies a language when a
00:07:09 person  foreigner learns the language
00:07:11 ends up
00:07:13 mixing those sounds ends up saying
00:07:15 the same
00:07:17 for example in Spanish we say we have
00:07:21 the  r and r are two different sounds
00:07:25 but it is not the same as perro no or ano
00:07:30 is not the same as year they are also
00:07:33 different sounds because it is important to
00:07:36 say these sounds well because if not
00:07:41 the words get confused and the
00:07:44 meaning of the words get confused
00:07:47 yes  For example, you speak English and you
00:07:51 learn Spanish
00:07:53 because perhaps you don't know how to make the r, we get
00:07:57 the sound r and if you
00:08:01 make the r of English instead of the r, you make the r, well,
00:08:06 surely the Spanish understand you
00:08:10 whenever the r of the r stops.
00:08:15 not when there is only one, only one
00:08:17 r, you have to make the distinction, you have
00:08:21 to separate those sounds because otherwise it's
00:08:23 difficult to understand,
00:08:27 well, I think the best way to do
00:08:32 that is to get the pronunciation right, to
00:08:34 have a good accent, but also to
00:08:37 distinguish  the sounds of separating the
00:08:40 sounds in your head is listening a
00:08:44 lot listening a lot and well I suppose you
00:08:47 already knew it and you expected it
00:08:51 and I think that at first you have to listen a
00:08:54 lot  cho and listen for many hours listen to
00:08:58 hundreds of hours I don't know about 300 500 many
00:09:02 hours listen before before starting to
00:09:07 speak and before starting to read read
00:09:11 for the accent for the pronunciation
00:09:14 I think it is also better to leave it for
00:09:17 later
00:09:19 but above all talk talk  it can
00:09:23 get you
00:09:24 used to saying
00:09:26 the sounds one way or attaching the
00:09:29 sounds and then it's very difficult then it
00:09:33 's very difficult to separate them
00:09:37 and the best thing about learning this
00:09:41 way by listening is that it's very easy it's
00:09:45 easier it's not that  You have to choose
00:09:48 okay I learn the pronunciation well or
00:09:52 study I learn easily I learn
00:09:55 more easily no no not learning well it's
00:09:58 easier you just have to listen you
00:10:02 don't need to study or try to talk
00:10:05 to someone and stressed as they said
00:10:09 this was but it was a dog it's not  a method
00:10:14 a more relaxed way easier I
00:10:18 think I think they are all advantages but
00:10:21 hey tell me tell me what
00:10:23 you think if you think that having a good
00:10:26 Pronunciation is important or it is not
00:10:29 important, come on,

00:06:03 something, for example, related
00:06:06 to Game of Thrones or something like that, I
00:06:09 would have no idea. That's why I was a

00:06:29 's from a murderer, not a contract killer.

00:01:59 very comfortable
00:02:01 yes yes there are few yes  There are many or few, he
00:02:09 says that his eyes are red and that he
00:02:12 has runny nose that looks like cancer, but
00:02:17 now or the cancer doctor, no, but I need to
00:02:21 know why I have cancer.
00:02:33 two
00:02:36 problems that she has cancer cancer and
00:02:39 once she is violent without a home is a problem
00:02:43 but explain to me she has some other
00:02:46 problem some other symptom yes yes what
00:02:49 else is wrong sir move him from román if my
00:02:52 tummy hurts and my tummy lasts yes of
00:02:55 course it is possible that  you have
00:02:59 eye cancer and belly cancer I understand
00:03:03 now we'll see what bad luck that more
00:03:06 luck is not very common it is not very
00:03:08 likely but sometimes it happens that we will have
00:03:12 to do some tests but doctor
00:03:14 but don't worry no no most
00:03:17 people die from  most almost all but
00:03:20 there are no chances there are
00:03:23 chances of not dying exactly 1% 25 or
00:03:28 more or 55 like five pairs of eyes five
00:03:32 for the one with the belly more or less 5 by 5 25
00:03:37 if left very well
00:03:39 I have seen  I know that you have studied
00:03:41 mathematics
00:03:43 but the doctor doctor also
00:03:46 hurts my ass my ass my ass my ass
00:03:50 yes surely it's butt cancer but
00:03:53 let's see you can cough a little it
00:03:57 's cancer of power we'll have to talk
00:04:02 about the struggle for  the cough if you don't
00:04:05 know you are not in medicine I have
00:04:07 studied medicine the cough is very
00:04:10 important to determine the cancer of the
00:04:12 ass
00:04:13 we will have to do some tests it
00:04:16 is urgent look at you you can go to the
00:04:21 reception you can go here to the
00:04:25 reception of the hospital and  you give them
00:04:27 this and ask them for
00:04:31 an ass analysis analysis of an
00:04:35 ass analysis they are going to look at me in
00:04:38 the ass ask them for an
00:04:41 exact urgent urgent ass analysis so you
00:04:46 can come tomorrow with the results
00:04:50 they give you some results
00:04:52 He comes back tomorrow with the results,
00:04:55 I'm going to have them look at my exact ass and they'll
00:04:58 give me exact results and I'll bring them to you
00:05:01 exactly and then we're going to
00:05:03 determine if butt cancer is a
00:05:06 problem.  ema or it's not worth it because
00:05:10 belly cancer and eye cancer
00:05:13 will probably die so it's not worth it to
00:05:15 treat it it's
00:05:18 not seductive my wife my wife is going to
00:05:22 kill me
00:05:25 and maybe it's better she's going to suffer
00:05:33 less see you tomorrow Mr. Roman yes still
00:05:36 Now I'm still alive, we'll see him tomorrow, half
00:05:40 half, let's
00:05:46 see if the man is there, I
00:05:50 think he's going to die, probably if
00:05:53 he dies because the woman
00:05:56 jumped on him or because of cancer in
00:05:58 butt cancer butt cancer
00:06:01 and  What do
00:06:06 you think about it? Do you like it? Do you
00:06:10 like hospitals? Do you like doctors?
00:06:14 I think I think many people don't
00:06:17 like it very much. Tell us below in the
00:06:20 comments.

088,"00:00:00 who are you, your mother, come later today, my
00:00:07 mother is going to talk to us about how I was when I was
00:00:12 little
00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:19 hello
00:00:22 hello well
00:00:23 yes today my mother is here my mother has come
00:00:27 to thailand now she is traveling
00:00:30 in thailand and she is going to help me  He is going to
00:00:34 help record some videos
00:00:38 and today he is going to explain something
00:00:43 that mothers like to talk about
00:00:45 a lot. Mothers like to
00:00:50 explain things that make their children ashamed
00:00:55 [Laughter]
00:00:59 Well, explain to me Antonio when I was
00:01:02 little when i was little
00:01:05 i was a kid like what kind of kid was i
00:01:09 good when i was little very little very little i
00:01:12 was a kid who wouldn't stop still i
00:01:15 touched everything and touched and touched all the
00:01:18 ornamental things in the house from the park
00:01:22 and from from  the little park
00:01:25 the little children's park pulled the tablecloth with
00:01:28 all the food on it like this when I was very
00:01:32 very small very small I liked it he
00:01:37 was very naughty later when you were
00:01:41 a little older
00:01:44 if it continued the same you touched everything
00:01:46 he asked everything  and I was very
00:01:50 amused that things the way you saw them,
00:01:53 for example, from the pram see a
00:01:56 dog like a greyhound type greyhound and say
00:01:59 a horse and we're going by car not you in the
00:02:04 cart in the baby carriage the
00:02:06 baby organ in  the dog came to you
00:02:09 like this the very big one and you said a horse a
00:02:12 greyhound they are racing dogs yes
00:02:14 people and very thin and they run a lot they
00:02:17 are stylized
00:02:21 well they look a bit alike and it was a child
00:02:25 who cried and cried a lot no no no no
00:02:28 no it didn't come  and as a baby but as a baby it
00:02:31 is a bit of a baby only when you were
00:02:33 hungry all the whole day you were
00:02:34 asking for food and meals like a
00:02:37 bun eater he ate a lot you ate a lot and
00:02:40 as long as you ate you were fine
00:02:44 and he was not a fussy
00:02:47 eater you didn't eat your food  and then that
00:02:51 of all the adults calling
00:02:55 you to give you a little bit of their food because the
00:02:57 child ate everything they gave him as
00:02:59 if he were a puppy dog ​​that
00:03:01 everyone gives him food take take I was
00:03:07 a child already m  More other older when I started
00:03:10 to go to school and such
00:03:13 I had many friends
00:03:17 if you had we had friends but you
00:03:20 didn't care you could go with them or if they
00:03:24 told you 20 pablo with me play at my house
00:03:26 you would go well but if you were not able to
00:03:29 be alone playing  with the teeth
00:03:32 for hours and hours you didn't, you didn't
00:03:36 always need to be with them, you
00:03:37 had them latent, which are like ones, then
00:03:39 we read like laymen and I
00:03:42 could only be there playing for many hours,
00:03:45 I remember that I was in my room
00:03:46 playing with  cars also with
00:03:48 strollers with ramps and all the ramps
00:03:50 you also liked very much we
00:03:52 jumped into the cars that you also
00:03:54 liked very much and since then I
00:03:58 have bought all the small children a gift now I always
00:04:00 buy them a kiss because you loved
00:04:02 strollers  with a ramp to
00:04:04 buy it from the small children who have a great time
00:04:06 , they have a great time but I
00:04:09 also sometimes went with my friends if they
00:04:12 give you children from the same street if they also  I also
00:04:14 went out to play with children
00:04:16 and I remember that sometimes we played
00:04:18 soccer or I went to my friend's house
00:04:21 we played video games or my friend
00:04:24 played and I had to watch and leave how I
00:04:26 played very well
00:04:30 and when I was little I read a lot yes a
00:04:33 lot first  If you liked to
00:04:36 read a lot,
00:04:38 first at your school they did a marathon they
00:04:41 did a competition
00:04:43 I think that in second grade it was a
00:04:46 competition to see who read the most books
00:04:48 and well at first I went
00:04:50 first but then not because later
00:04:52 you started to like challenges like in  Instead
00:04:55 of reading a lot of books I'm going to read a
00:04:58 fat book fatter books fatter and
00:05:00 that's how you stayed the second I
00:05:04 remember that we had a whole poster on the wall
00:05:06 a
00:05:07 [Music]
00:05:08 a very big cardboard like that and there we go
00:05:11 pasting each book  that we read we glued
00:05:14 a different colored piece of paper at
00:05:17 school if then you saw who was
00:05:19 winning who was winning
00:05:21 I didn't know what to do it's a contest but
00:05:24 I didn't know how there were the names the
00:05:27 names  of each student and then you saw that
00:05:29 we were advancing each book was a piece
00:05:33 of paper with the name of the book but then
00:05:35 you started reading fat books and now you
00:05:37 didn't win if it seemed unfair to you
00:05:40 because of course they left fat books and
00:05:42 I remember that I was reading twenty thousand
00:05:45 Leagues
00:05:47 Under the Sea' by Jules Verne that if it's fatter,
00:05:50 thicker and well, it takes longer to
00:05:53 finish less
00:05:57 and when I was little I was
00:06:00 good at sports, well, regular, regular
00:06:04 about football, a little worse like that
00:06:07 since it was not difficult for you to run and so the best thing
00:06:12 was that he did not run very fast so they made you the
00:06:18 soccer goalkeeper of the west goalkeeper but
00:06:21 later when you were older he
00:06:22 began to do well, especially
00:06:24 volleyball and sports,
00:06:27 then in high school in the  high school
00:06:29 I started doing volleyball volleyball skiing
00:06:31 all that is good for you but
00:06:33 skiing yes I liked skiing but it went very
00:06:37 fast and you fell every moment I
00:06:39 have it from the first time you went  you
00:06:41 ski sad 50 times every time
00:06:44 you took a curve you fell how
00:06:47 old how old was I the first time we went
00:06:49 to the series once you would have been three or
00:06:51 four three or four years old
00:06:53 you were already younger but but and
00:06:56 plastic poles and so on
00:06:58 I ski skiing behind your father
00:07:01 I don't know I would be four years old like that so I
00:07:03 thought that when you get to the bottom
00:07:05 after having hit yourself or fallen in
00:07:07 each curve you would say that we go
00:07:09 home
00:07:10 but not again on the ground
00:07:15 but as a little little little with two  years
00:07:17 so we took you we took you once
00:07:20 with plastic skis to see why
00:07:22 try them on the snow there is a drop of
00:07:24 a little drop and you said we are going to a
00:07:27 bar maybe he was cold
00:07:32 hungry
00:07:33 or that you did not find a roll and no he
00:07:37 did not master it if you said  Here's a
00:07:39 bar, well, let's talk that there's cacaolat,
00:07:41 there's a milk and cocoa drink, and in
00:07:46 general I'm because I think that many times
00:07:49 you told me that it was good that I was
00:07:52 unconscious, I didn't go up, I went up the sites
00:07:54 I didn't care about hurting myself You weren't
00:07:57 afraid of anything You didn't care if you fell, you didn't care You
00:08:00 didn't try not to fall
00:08:04 If I don't like myself If I fall,
00:08:06 well, you didn't think I think it was how I come,
00:08:09 I'm going there You weren't afraid of it I
00:08:13 always say that  I was a terrorist
00:08:15 terrorist
00:08:17 but against myself but even so
00:08:22 I have never broken I have broken a bone
00:08:25 these are the small ones
00:08:32 I think 22 other times I have had a hand in a
00:08:35 cast for one a crack in a
00:08:38 finger but it has never had a leg
00:08:42 or an arm
00:08:46 and  When I was little, I said that
00:08:50 I wanted to be when I grew up, what I wanted to do
00:08:52 when I grew up, well, when I was little, I
00:08:54 wanted to be a reporter for National
00:08:58 Geographic, I wanted to be a naturalist.
00:09:14 that there are photos of animals and such an act
00:09:16 then his ideal was that he would hide
00:09:18 in a kind of
00:09:20 tent and from there he has  He would take pictures of the
00:09:23 birds and in a forest he is hiding and
00:09:25 taking pictures of the birds yes yes and
00:09:27 he saw God yes and he loved
00:09:30 birds and he studied it they had an
00:09:31 encyclopedia of birds it is such a
00:09:34 fat book with the encyclopedia of
00:09:36 all the  birds and they learned how
00:09:39 long the birds were with their wingspan
00:09:41 how much they flew how much they thought they
00:09:44 learned all that I remember if I had
00:09:46 a book yes fat enough fat
00:09:48 if another one smaller with like a
00:09:51 card from Spain and a very large poster
00:09:57 I still have assumptions  unique even in
00:09:59 your house
00:10:01 yes yes I really liked animals
00:10:04 animals yes but also before that
00:10:06 because I said I wanted to do something
00:10:08 else
00:10:10 when I grew up because I said I wanted to be an inventor so
00:10:13 yes well that manager has said that before and after
00:10:15 before
00:10:17 and he  I invented spaceships with
00:10:21 multiple functions every day I drew
00:10:24 one with multiple functions this look
00:10:26 mom this button if I press it
00:10:28 a bomb will go off if I
00:10:30 press this button s  ale I don't know what it means that
00:10:32 every day he invented a series of a
00:10:35 spaceship to travel to light and
00:10:37 space and with many things if I
00:10:40 also remember a weapon like a
00:10:42 gun or something that I invented that
00:10:45 also had many things  many
00:10:47 different things many functions
00:10:48 yes yes I had a lot of imagination
00:10:53 and I liked watching TV yes of
00:10:57 course watching old TV
00:10:59 come on incredible it stayed as
00:11:02 and not chalked
00:11:04 from the drawings the
00:11:07 cartoons cartoons the movies they
00:11:10 knew it by heart the the dialogues  Above
00:11:14 all, Cinderella, my sister really
00:11:18 liked watching Cinderella,
00:11:21 if he memorized all the
00:11:23 songs, all the dialogues and the
00:11:24 intonation of the sentences, because I watch it
00:11:27 dozens of times, many times,
00:11:30 and I, well, look how it was on TV,
00:11:32 well, too  I sat down and many times
00:11:35 the lion king too' the king of ons you learned in

043,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about the reconquest the
00:00:06 reconquest is the time the period
00:00:11 of history
00:00:13 in which the kingdoms of northern
00:00:17 Spain'
00:00:19 in the north of Spain there were
00:00:22 several
00:00:25 kingdoms Christian
00:00:28 Christian kingdoms and the Christian kingdoms
00:00:33 reconquered returned to
00:00:37 reconquer the peninsula  Iberian' of the
00:00:42 Muslims of Islam Islam was in the
00:00:47 whole peninsula no and they
00:00:52 reconquered it that's why it's called the
00:00:55 reconquest
00:00:57 [Music]
00:01:03 good well yes this period period of
00:01:08 time is called the reconquest
00:01:12 and it lasted a long long long time
00:01:17 since the  year 722 until 1492 a
00:01:30 long time
00:01:33 is more than seven centuries
00:01:37 and in the 8th century in the
00:01:42 8th century the Muslims invaded
00:01:47 the Iberian Peninsula they invaded it but
00:01:51 the north the north zone in the north there are
00:01:56 many mountains
00:01:58 there are mountains the mountains yes that's why I do
00:02:03 n't  they conquered they thought
00:02:07 it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's not worth it it's not
00:02:11 worth it because it's a lot of effort a
00:02:15 lot of effort we'll get tired it's cold
00:02:21 it's cold and it's not a pain  igro is not a
00:02:27 danger it does not
00:02:31 cost a lot of money we will spend money
00:02:35 but there are no benefits it will not give us
00:02:39 any money
00:02:41 that is why there continued to
00:02:44 be christians here
00:02:46 but in the muslim area in the
00:02:51 muslim area at this time there were times
00:02:56 in which the religions the different
00:03:02 religions  different religions were
00:03:06 allowed there was no problem but there were
00:03:09 times there were periods when
00:03:16 people of these religions were
00:03:20 not treated well they did not have the same
00:03:23 rights as Muslims that is why
00:03:27 many people from these areas many people
00:03:32 were  to the north it went to the Christian kingdoms
00:03:40 and one of the kingdoms was Asturias
00:03:47 Asturias
00:03:49 was one of the strongest kingdoms
00:03:53 and it resisted and resisted but not only
00:03:57 resisted but it began to expand to
00:04:01 expand
00:04:04 yes and the Muslims
00:04:08 began to worry they worried and
00:04:13 they attacked they tried to attack they
00:04:17 tried to attack
00:04:20 but asturias resisted resisted and
00:04:25 even came to take l  isboa lisbon they
00:04:30 came to take lisbon
00:04:35 as lisbon in 798
00:04:42 but while the northern kingdoms
00:04:46 expanded
00:04:49 while they expanded
00:04:52 from the south of the south
00:04:55 reinforcements also came more reinforcements
00:05:01 that is why the expansion of the
00:05:05 Christian kingdoms was very slow
00:05:09 and so were the kingdoms  Christians sometimes
00:05:13 got together sometimes divided yes
00:05:21 sometimes they allied they allied but sometimes
00:05:25 they fought yes yes and sometimes some
00:05:29 Christian kingdoms and some
00:05:32 Muslim kingdoms no because the Muslims
00:05:36 also had kingdoms kingdoms different
00:05:39 kingdoms
00:05:41 and the Christian kingdoms and the Muslims
00:05:44 a  sometimes they were allied and sometimes the
00:05:49 muslim kingdoms fought among themselves
00:05:54 and the first
00:06:01 half the northern half of the peninsula was
00:06:05 conquered very slowly very slowly but
00:06:10 the second half got faster
00:06:13 pretty pretty quick
00:06:16 and in the century in the 14th century in  the 14th century
00:06:22 not the 1300-odd years almost all
00:06:29 almost the entire peninsula was from the
00:06:32 Christian kingdoms of the kingdoms  Christians but
00:06:37 Granada remained
00:06:40 that Granada
00:06:43 Granada is one now it is a city in
00:06:46 Spain but at this time it was a kingdom it
00:06:50 was the kingdom
00:06:53 the kingdom of Granada and this was Muslim
00:06:58 here there was Islam and the rest of the
00:07:01 peninsula
00:07:02 were kingdoms they
00:07:04 were
00:07:06 kingdoms Christian kingdoms
00:07:09 there was Castile  Navarra Aragon and Portugal
00:07:15 and the invasion The final invasion
00:07:20 took a long long time because there
00:07:25 are also mountains
00:07:28 the mountains are always a problem there are
00:07:32 mountains and Granada gave them
00:07:37 money gave money to the other kingdoms yes
00:07:40 that's why the other kingdoms weren't in a
00:07:43 hurry no  they were in a hurry to conquer
00:07:47 Granada
00:07:49 the invasion the invasion of Granada was
00:07:53 over it was over in 1492 in 1492 there were
00:08:02 the Catholic kings there was Isabel Isabel
00:08:08 the Catholic and Fernando Isabel and Fernando there
00:08:13 was Isabel the First Isabel the First and
00:08:17 Fernando the Second and the two of them
00:08:20 together are called  the Catholic kings the
00:08:25 Catholic kings because they were very, very
00:08:28 Catholic
00:08:30 and in the next video in the next
00:08:34 video I will talk about what  What else happened
00:08:39 in this era that happened more or less with the Catholic kings?
00:08:43 You know it, you
00:08:46 have an idea, say it, say it, if
00:08:50 you know what comes later or what happened more
00:08:54 or less at this time,
00:08:57 okay, bye-bye,
00:09:12 no, no religions

00:00:05 hollande in this video I am in
00:00:10 a slightly different place as you can see
00:00:14 I am in the Alhambra complex here
00:00:19 in Granada
00:00:20 and we are going for a walk to the
00:00:25 Carmen de los Mártires which is a
00:00:29 very old house with a garden  that you
00:00:34 can visit is a very beautiful garden is
00:00:38 one of my favorite places in Granada'
00:00:43 and I'm going to show you today right
00:00:47 now I'm walking through
00:00:51 the Alhambra grounds and as you can see it
00:00:55 's like a park it
00:00:58 's very green
00:01:01 very pretty it
00:01:04 has a  small stream
00:01:10 and you can hear
00:01:12 the sound of the water it
00:01:18 is very quiet
00:01:20 and I really like walking around here it is an
00:01:25 area of ​​Granada that is very close to the
00:01:29 center
00:01:31 but the environment is very different because it
00:01:35 is very quiet there is no noise from cars
00:01:39 there are not many people
00:01:43 so I'm going to continue walking until I
00:01:47 get to the house and then we're going to take
00:01:52 a little walk around the garden so
00:01:55 you can see what it's like
00:01:58 [Music]
00:02:12 [Music]
00:02:16 ah
00:02:20 a
00:02:22 [Music]
00:02:24 he's
00:02:27 good, I'm already inside the carmen de
00:02:30 los mártires a  behind me I have a
00:02:34 very nice view of the city of Granada
00:02:39 and behind here is the house that we are going to
00:02:45 see
00:02:46 now Carmen de los Mártires is an
00:02:50 old house but it is not as old as the
00:02:53 Alhambra it is not a house of
00:02:58 Arab Muslim architecture it is a  house that was
00:03:02 built in the 19th century and before that
00:03:09 before building the house in this place
00:03:13 there was a convent in this place it was
00:03:17 where the first church of granada was built
00:03:21 because granada was a
00:03:24 muslim territory and when the christians the
00:03:28 catholic kings
00:03:29 conquered granada
00:03:34 Well, Queen Isabella the Catholic' decided to
00:03:37 build the first church in Granada here, she
00:03:40 decided to build a small hermitage that
00:03:46 later became a convent
00:03:55 [Music]
00:04:06 at my favorite expense, this house is the royal estate,
00:04:14 there is a female and a male
00:04:18 3
00:04:23 [Music  ]
00:04:42 from this balcony
00:04:45 we can see the mountains
00:04:51 [Music]
00:04:57 and the whole city
00:05:07 here there is a small pond
00:05:16 and the leaves that have not yet fallen
00:05:20 from the trees completely even though  We are
00:05:25 in December
00:05:31 as you know Carmen is a
00:05:35 woman's name a Spanish man of a woman
00:05:40 and Pablo asked me if the name Carmen
00:05:43 comes from this type of house because this
00:05:48 house is a Carmen but according to what I have read
00:05:52 these houses do not have the same origin
00:05:57 Grenadines are called Cármenes because
00:06:01 Carmen in Arabic means vineyard the
00:06:06 vineyard is the place where they grow where
00:06:10 the vine grows where the tree grows the
00:06:13 plant that gives the grape and Carmen the name
00:06:18 of a woman' comes from the Hebrew carmel which
00:06:22 means
00:06:24 garden of God
00:06:27 or at least  I've read that on the internet but
00:06:31 I can't guarantee
00:06:34 it and today's visit ends here.
00:06:38 I hope you liked this little
00:06:41 tour and if you ever come to Granada to

017,"00:00:00 hello good today we are going to look at memes
00:00:03 ximénez if in spanish we say memes
00:00:08 I don't like it I don't like that memes are said
00:00:11 but everyone says memes and I
00:00:14 can't change it so good well I
00:00:18 also say memes so let's
00:00:27 start with this website  to a website of memes
00:00:31 in Spanish how much bastard bastard is an
00:00:34 insult so don't use it don't
00:00:36 tell anyone
00:00:38 and well now because it's the time it is well
00:00:41 many babies are going to be about the
00:00:44 coronavirus so well I'm going to read
00:00:48 a few too  about the
00:00:49 coronavirus but if there are
00:00:51 also elements of other topics, I will
00:00:53 also try to have more memes of various
00:00:55 topics. We do not start here to see help
00:01:00 for the self-employed
00:01:01 , aid packages for the self-employed begin to arrive,
00:01:05 this is in reference to the fact that in Spain
00:01:08 They are preparing
00:01:10 financial aid for people who have jobs
00:01:13 so that they are not fired from the company the
00:01:16 government is paying part of their
00:01:18 salaries there is aid for certain companies
00:01:20 and such but for now  a there is no aid for
00:01:24 self-employed people for people who work for
00:01:27 themselves for people like me I am self-employed
00:01:30 no I do not work for a company
00:01:32 I am not self-employed in Spain but before
00:01:34 I was last year I was self-employed in
00:01:37 Spain so the help offered  to the
00:01:40 government is a rope a rope to
00:01:43 place you to commit suicide no good a
00:01:47 little macabre but well
00:01:51 thanks to the netflix titles I didn't
00:01:54 miss any detail and in the subtitle it
00:02:00 says sniffles it doesn't make the
00:02:05 sound sniffles because on netflix when
00:02:07 you put on the subtitles they are subtitles for the
00:02:10 deaf, not for people who do not hear well
00:02:13 so in addition to what the
00:02:15 characters in the sentences say, it also
00:02:19 puts background music on you or puts on any
00:02:22 other sound that is in the scene
00:02:24 puts it on then it sniffles well
00:02:28 perhaps it is too much information
00:02:31 an incomparable peace and tranquility this
00:02:35 is how women look when they sleep because they
00:02:37 know that their boyfriend cannot go out
00:02:40 again due to the coronavirus we are
00:02:43 closed at home so her boyfriend and girlfriends can't go out
00:02:46 the girlfriends are jealous well
00:02:49 they're calm not the boyfriends
00:02:52 too because there are also many jealous boys let's
00:02:54 see let's see let's see
00:02:56 this is a bit of a geek so who
00:02:59 understood understood if van gogh has
00:03:04 cable  video and an audio cable only
00:03:07 one side because he can't hear on the other side no
00:03:09 mozart has a video cable he sees but he doesn't
00:03:13 have an audio cable from any side he
00:03:16 has no sound what is the
00:03:19 name of the singer sorry sorry but
00:03:21 I forgot the name  The name of the singer
00:03:22 was a blind singer, not that today he hopes
00:03:26 that he was beginning to see the last one because he
00:03:29 was blind, therefore he does not have a video cable, he
00:03:30 only has audio and Stephen
00:03:34 Stephen Hawking, who has many cables
00:03:38 that go to many places because well, he was
00:03:40 very intelligent  He wasn't very smart, he has a
00:03:43 lot of cables, well, he's original, he's
00:03:46 fine, I feel like they're watching me, I'm going to
00:03:49 buy the supermarket, my neighbor
00:03:53 is very funny, this dog, but if not, he's
00:03:57 in Spain right now.  It happens that there are
00:04:00 people who go somewhere who
00:04:02 have a reason to go somewhere
00:04:04 but feel watched sometimes there are
00:04:07 neighbors there are people on the balconies
00:04:09 who insult them or tell them what they are doing
00:04:10 outside when they have a reason to be
00:04:13 outside to  I gave birth to a
00:04:15 confinement body somewhere every
00:04:18 morning seeing the exquisite and sensual
00:04:20 body that I have and it's Winnie the Pooh
00:04:23 showing her belly yes I don't know why
00:04:27 I find it amusing but it amuses me and yes,
00:04:30 many people say that with
00:04:32 confinement being  at home without
00:04:35 moving without doing sports because they are
00:04:37 going to gain weight they are not going to gain weight I don't know if they
00:04:40 did so much sport before but
00:04:42 hey batman right now I
00:04:45 can't go out I'm at home I have
00:04:47 some viruses
00:04:50 when you confuse the can of graffiti
00:04:54 with the  of insecticide when you confuse
00:04:57 wright with a spray paint pincha
00:05:03 wright is the one to kill insects it is not a
00:05:07 spray to kill insects
00:05:10 and you confuse the raid with the solar sun it
00:05:13 can be any  thing, but it refers
00:05:15 to the graffiti paint, not to the paint,
00:05:17 spray paint, and we
00:05:21 would say scorpion, we would not say scorpion,
00:05:24 the scorpion with the black paint, and the
00:05:27 scorpion left pimped pimped like a
00:05:29 car that you have changed, the paint has changed
00:05:33 me  funny well let's try
00:05:35 instagram let's look at instagram a bit
00:05:37 to see what we
00:05:40 find this account is also fun
00:05:43 bastard and have a minute of silence
00:05:46 for those who have birthdays in April if
00:05:49 people who have birthdays in April are not going to be
00:05:51 able to have  a birthday party with
00:05:53 his friends and his family is serious doctor
00:05:57 I don't understand I don't understand these these
00:06:00 months I have already seen several with these
00:06:02 four gentlemen but I don't know who they are and I
00:06:05 don't know what they represent so you
00:06:07 know write me write me in the
00:06:09 comments ok this  I think it's
00:06:12 good advice if we get out of this the best
00:06:15 advice I can give you is to run
00:06:17 for your dreams, you already saw that life
00:06:19 changes from one day to the next and be happy  Yes,
00:06:22 we have seen that well, many of us
00:06:25 had plans, we had thought yes, well, I
00:06:28 will go to such a place, I will travel to such another, or
00:06:31 I will have the opportunity to go do
00:06:34 whatever it takes to go surfing, for example,
00:06:36 in my case, well, you never know, you never know.
00:06:39 If you will have the opportunity or if something is going to
00:06:41 happen and you will no longer have it, then it is
00:06:43 better to do the things that we want to do
00:06:46 as soon as possible and not think that
00:06:50 there will always be time because we
00:06:51 do not have infinite time in our lives
00:06:54 the supermarket cashiers  They turned out to
00:06:57 be more important than the soccer players,
00:07:00 yes, yes, the supermarket cashiers are still working right now
00:07:04 , but not the
00:07:08 people who play soccer, the
00:07:10 soccer players, let's see, I already had it clear, it
00:07:12 's clear that soccer players are not
00:07:15 important and we don't earn more money,
00:07:18 no  we have a higher salary because we are
00:07:23 important but because there are few
00:07:28 people who can do our
00:07:30 job because there are few offers if there are
00:07:32 few people who can play football
00:07:35 Also, well, they won't go, they will earn a
00:07:38 lot of money, if there are many people who
00:07:40 can work as cashiers, all
00:07:42 cashiers in the supermarket, it is
00:07:46 difficult for them to earn a lot of money.
00:07:50 The baby is going to be shot with a
00:07:53 water gun to baptize it, not
00:07:56 when a  The baby is born, they baptize it as it
00:07:59 says here baptism from a distance but
00:08:01 normally the priest takes it and pours a
00:08:04 few drops of water on its head but
00:08:06 here it does not want to get close in case it has
00:08:08 the coronavirus and the baptized holy water
00:08:16 titanic amphibious version but here the
00:08:19 frog is  push kick him take it

00:08:30 I'll never forget this you've hurt me so much
00:08:32 that it's hard for me to be happy
00:08:35 okay I've become very sad and I know you do
00:08:38 n't love me like  You have been able to do to
00:08:41 me how could you have done to me that you have taken away
00:08:43 my only illusion of truth you are
00:08:47 sure that you do not want to have the mistake
00:08:52 the children with the dogs my my sister when I
00:08:54 was little was was even  ecida really wanted
00:08:57 to have a dog and well, yes,
00:09:01 sometimes children try to
00:09:04 emotionally manipulate their parents in order
00:09:07 to get what they want, not if
00:09:10 by chance you catch
00:09:12 comic 19 and they tell you that you are not going to
00:09:14 get over it with them a  a kilo and a half of
00:09:17 raw corn is not worth anything you are not
00:09:21 going to be cured of the cobi but the scare that
00:09:23 the crematorium is going to have is not
00:09:25 paid for with money when they
00:09:27 cremate your body when you die and
00:09:29 they burn your body well they will get
00:09:33 popcorn popcorn if we all had
00:09:37 five kilos it is as if no one had
00:09:39 gained five kilos the weight is relative
00:09:52 miley cyrus already prepared new
00:09:55 disney plus series it is about the basque remake

00:10:02 well you know i guess hannah montana and
00:10:05 yes  The look that Miley Cyrus is wearing here, the
00:10:09 haircut and such, is very typical
00:10:12 of youth, I would say of
00:10:14 Spanish youth, it is in various places in Spain,
00:10:17 but perhaps a little more Basque or  maybe
00:10:20 this look is more original it originated
00:10:23 in the basque country i don't know in catalonia
00:10:25 i've also seen it i've seen a lot of

00:02:15 doesn't exist in the real world,
00:02:19 exactly in the  the real world is not a
00:02:21 fictional character of course it is not from a
00:02:24 book from the book it is from a movie no it
00:02:27 is not a real character very well and this
00:02:31 character is alive right now no this
00:02:37 character is no longer in this world he
00:02:40 is not alive he is dead  It's about to
00:02:45 about to,
00:02:45 I'm going to I'm going to mark
00:02:47 one and two questions two questions come on
00:02:52 next

00:02:56 exactly okay this character is it's a
00:03:00 woman yes yes yes it's an improvement it's a
00:03:04 woman okay it's a person one  woman is worth
00:03:07 a dead woman a dead woman is
00:03:11 current is very well
00:03:12 is a woman
00:03:15 [Music]
00:03:19 is an actress was an actress not this woman
00:03:23 was not an actress is an actress is a person
00:03:26 who appears on TV in the
00:03:30 movies in hollywood movies acting or
00:03:33 ro  Give me a kiss I think that one but no, she's not an
00:03:38 actress, she's not that woman, she wasn't an
00:03:40 actress, she wasn't an actress, okay, she was a
00:03:44 woman who was an artist,
00:03:47 no, she wasn't, she wasn't an artist, nor was the
00:03:52 painter not a singer, she
00:03:56 didn't dance or dance or anything  She didn't
00:03:59 do anything related to the arts. She
00:04:03 was a woman
00:04:05 who was a politician in the government. She
00:04:10 was a woman from the world of politics.
00:04:12 Politics in the government
00:04:15 of those who write the laws and you do.
00:04:22 a European woman
00:04:29 yes yes yes she was a European woman although
00:04:34 she sometimes didn't act like that but she was
00:04:38 a European woman and a woman from Europe
00:04:40 is okay we talked about Europe and it was
00:04:45 political
00:04:46 this is another another question it was political
00:04:49 in a European country
00:04:53 I have a  easy idea I'm not going to try
00:05:00 the brand of these it's very easy it
00:05:06 's fun thatcher if you know
00:05:11 there aren't many politicians a certain woman in
00:05:15 Europe in the mouth would be less
00:05:17 then it's long and I do think
00:05:21 political women who are dead
00:05:24 and  I knew margaret thatcher
00:05:26 cleopatra because if the others I
00:05:31 know are alive they are not dead very
00:05:34 well I had fun he said very well well
00:05:37 now it's your turn we can't
00:05:41 erase this ahead and this too
00:05:45 you have already tried a new one not if I
00:05:48 have already  Thought of a character okay now I
00:05:53 have the red one I'm going to count the
00:05:55 questions okay
00:05:58 drawing my friend takes her to see the
00:06:01 first questions they are always the
00:06:03 same yes more or less the same no at
00:06:06 first it's a real character it's a
00:06:09 character from the real world no  It's real, it's
00:06:13 not, it's not worth it, it doesn't exist in this world, nothing
00:06:18 is a person, it's a man, it's a man, it
00:06:23 's let's say it's more than three male
00:06:27 men or male husbands from the Balearic Islands in
00:06:30 the masculine gender that separates us
00:06:33 therefore it's not human because it's not  human is
00:06:39 not not human is an animal animal
00:06:44 monster can be an alien being
00:06:47 minor or a voice
00:06:51 is an animal is an animal is an animal
00:06:54 some animal like those that exist in the
00:06:57 world
00:06:58 what is the question
00:07:05 is very based on u  n animal like those
00:07:09 in the real world
00:07:11 if it's an animal it's an animal it's an
00:07:14 animal it's animal
00:07:16 [Music]
00:07:18 this animal can talk it can talk it
00:07:22 can talk like shoulders it ca
00:07:25 n't talk it's not an animal that can talk
00:07:27 or the community
00:07:29 this animal appears in  an animal book
00:07:34 appears in a book I think it doesn't look
00:07:38 good on me it doesn't appear in a genet book it doesn't
00:07:40 appear in a movie it appears in
00:07:43 movies in a non-segi movie and
00:07:48 if it appears in such a serious issue in
00:07:49 cinema
00:07:52 movies movie very well perfect  it is a
00:07:56 mammal a mammal yes but no
00:08:00 mammals an animal itself if they give you
00:08:03 milk it is milk to babies a good
00:08:06 example it gives them milk and they do not have eggs they
00:08:08 do not lay smell no this is not a
00:08:13 mammal no
00:08:14 a dog it is a mammal etc we will shoot
00:08:18 we are perfect mammals it is a
00:08:20 mammal it
00:08:21 is a mammal it
00:08:24 weighs less than a typical adult man
00:08:28 weighs in weight if it is less it is less than me
00:08:38 some animals are people's pets they
00:08:41 live with a person if your
00:08:44 animal is a pet  from another character
00:08:47 my animal if it is a pet is there someone
00:08:51 who takes care of it and feeds it yes yes
00:08:56 this is a danger it is a feline it is not a
00:09:01 feline wait wait the cats are the
00:09:04 cats the selector the lions the tigers
00:09:09 tigers termination of the pet therefore
00:09:11 a pet may wonder its
00:09:12 charm but it's not a cat no it's not it
00:09:18 's bigger than a typical cat it's
00:09:21 bigger than a cat
00:09:24 no it's not bigger than a cat
00:09:29 I'm thinking it can't be a rabbit it
00:09:31 could be a mouse because it's  a pet
00:09:33 if a mouse know in
00:09:37 the movies they are cartoons if there
00:09:40 are cartoons cartoons where they
00:09:43 are not movies recorded with a camera or
00:09:46 with us with not perfect actors they
00:09:48 are drawings they are disney movies wait for disney
00:09:50 drawings
00:09:57 and I have no idea it could be a  more I
00:10:05 think there are more questions that you can now
00:10:08 you should ask because you don't know you don't
00:10:10 know anything about the history of the character
00:10:13 what the character does as generals is
00:10:16 the story worth it is a
00:10:20 is one of the  main characters
00:10:23 in the story this
00:10:25 character is a very important character in the
00:10:28 story he speaks but does not speak
00:10:32 15-15 questions I am not going to lose the
00:10:35 important character in the story but he
00:10:37 does not speak extract they are
00:10:40 animated films made with computer
00:10:43 3d animation  3d animation is not
00:10:46 normal flat animation of a lifetime
00:10:49 Japanese animation on the sides and they are
00:10:52 Japanese yes they are Japanese Japanese drawings yes
00:10:58 [Music]
00:11:00 I have not said movies and television
00:11:05 television also if animal television
00:11:21 is a question
00:11:39 yes
00:11:45 [Laughs]
00:11:47 we ask another  round the one more and I
00:11:50 one more is that I don't want to
00:11:53 always ask the same thing but the
00:11:57 first one is difficult we don't have to know
00:12:00 if we need to know if it's real or not it's
00:12:02 not real it's a real person
00:12:07 if it's from the real world very  well
00:12:11 this person I am not going to ask if he is
00:12:15 dead or not
00:12:18 a man
00:12:20 is a man who is a man is of
00:12:22 the masculine gender is a man and is a
00:12:25 person is not an animal is not very good
00:12:29 this person has been very good this
00:12:34 man is an artist
00:12:37 this man is an artist this is an artist
00:12:41 his name is
00:12:43 a man who is an artist I don't know sorry he's an
00:12:50 artist but I don't know if he's a painter if he's an
00:12:54 actor yes it's quite so I'm going to
00:13:00 present I'm going to ask  that's a
00:13:02 singer
00:13:05 if you show yourself that this is a singer he's
00:13:11 a singer man I don't know if he's dead
00:13:14 or he's still alive
00:13:18 you can ask us if I can but now
00:13:22 for now it's not missing he's a singer from the
00:13:27 usa well no the truth is he's not a
00:13:31 singer from  United degrees okay, he
00:13:35 is a European singer from Europe, he
00:13:39 is not a European singer either, well,
00:13:43 yes, he is going to be a
00:13:46 Latin American singer, then neither are the three of them,
00:13:50 because in Latin America there are many
00:13:52 singers, the truth is that yes, but he is not,
00:13:57 but Latin America
00:14:00 there are many of the  who know us he is an
00:14:05 asian singer yes he is a singer and he is
00:14:09 asian an asian singer an
00:14:13 asian singer it is difficult it is a
00:14:17 bit it is not it is not so difficult not
00:14:20 everyone knows him they concede it h
00:14:22 ace seriously okay well if everyone
00:14:27 knows him okay I'm going to ask
00:14:32 the country and there are many countries but there aren't many
00:14:39 countries where we know the singers of
00:14:43 course no no no I don't know I do
00:14:47 n't know Japan Korea
00:14:53 yes
00:15:02 oysters you know Sainz
00:15:11 from those of  asia I think it's the easiest
00:15:19 I'm afraid of a character and it's not thought of
00:15:24 one I've already thought about it I've thought of a
00:15:27 character ok this will be the last one
00:15:30 there's no way
00:15:32 come on shoot you have to
00:15:35 ask first the truth although
00:15:38 I ask  see the first question
00:15:39 always the same is it a fictional
00:15:42 character or is it a real character is it not
00:15:45 fictional have this high cash is it
00:15:47 a real person in the world ok perfect
00:15:51 is it
00:15:53 a woman if it is a woman is it a woman
00:15:57 that woman is alive is a  woman who
00:16:01 is not well is not dead very well
00:16:06 perfect this famous woman became
00:16:11 famous in the world of arts
00:16:16 she became famous known for being an
00:16:19 artist for being a singer or a painter or not
00:16:23 in the world of science it was not
00:16:29 mo  They didn't do chemistry or physics,
00:16:37 it wasn't scientific, okay, I could think
00:16:40 later, first I'll tell you, is this woman
00:16:43 was alive during the 20th century?
00:16:53 it was political no it didn't go
00:16:57 on TV often on TV
00:17:00 he thanked me in which he knew a lot
00:17:03 on TV it didn't come out much not very well that
00:17:07 woman spoke English as her mother
00:17:10 tongue as her first language
00:17:13 English was her first language the language  of
00:17:14 her her parents no yes her mom and dad I
00:17:19 think she was not English it was not true
00:17:22 English not English ajam from England she was
00:17:24 European that woman this woman is not
00:17:27 European
00:17:29 she is not from Europe that woman was Asian

00:17:40 then  That woman was from East Asia,
00:17:45 that is, China, Japan, Korea, East,
00:17:49 East Asia, I don't know, she wasn't from East Asia, she
00:17:51 was from India, she was from India, and if she was from
00:17:56 India, for example, the 15th century, the 20th century, yes, I
00:18:00 am in my 20s like this, but no.  it was hers it
00:18:09 was e  uropean in europe let's
00:18:16 see that woman was a

00:18:29 i.e. christian yes of the
00:18:35 christian religion mother teresa of calcutta
00:18:44 european india of calcutta of
00:18:50 course i had always thought she was a
00:18:53 journalist no maybe  not
00:18:56 all of us have won backwards
00:19:04 I hope it wasn't very very difficult I
00:19:07 think everyone knows these
00:19:09 people but the first one after 2020
00:19:13 will be very easy

010,"00:00:00 Well, today I'm going to tell you about my
00:00:04 experience doing the Camino de
00:00:07 Santiago
00:00:10 [Music]
00:00:14 Laura, how are you doing, and you, me,
00:00:19 here, calmly, 50 times, if
00:00:23 we wear the same clothes, I don't know if
00:00:26 we wear the same shirt for months,
00:00:30 but we are minimalists  If
00:00:34 we try to live with very few
00:00:39 things, what are you going to talk about today, what are you going to tell us, well,
00:00:42 today I am going to talk about
00:00:46 and experience doing the Camino de
00:00:50 Santiago. Yes, because we have a video already
00:00:54 in Dreaming Spanish of the Camino de
00:00:57 Santiago, you can see it if you want  later
00:00:59 after this video but I
00:01:02 personally have never done it I have never
00:01:05 gone to do the Camino de Santiago neither
00:01:08 walking nor by bike nor nis or by car
00:01:13 so I want you to explain to us how
00:01:15 the experience was for you
00:01:19 because I know that the Camino de Santiago was
00:01:23 you can do it from several places from
00:01:25 many places you can do it from
00:01:28 badajoz if I'm not mistaken it says it's
00:01:30 badajoz
00:01:32 so you can say it from many
00:01:34 places you from where you started and  Or I have to
00:01:38 say that I did it all but it did it
00:01:42 all because I did one that is very
00:01:44 short which is the English
00:01:47 way an English way goes from Ferrol s
00:01:56 so I started the way in
00:01:59 Ferrol and I went to Santiago de
00:02:02 Compostela you started in Galicia I  in
00:02:06 galicia within the province of the
00:02:09 province
00:02:10 that is not cheating
00:02:12 that is not cheating on the english road
00:02:15 because the english because the english
00:02:19 came from england by boat
00:02:23 to ferrol
00:02:27 valencia- and that is if it is the minimum
00:02:30 you have to do to  that they give you
00:02:32 the certificate
00:02:36 not really I think that the
00:02:38 certificate
00:02:39 but they give one to see it is not to go by plane
00:02:43 to Santiago de Compostela and
00:02:47 Cathedral and that they put the seal you have
00:02:52 to have a couple of followed by
00:02:54 some inns and some  hostels
00:02:57 where you have stayed and I have
00:03:03 if I'm not mistaken I have it here
00:03:06 okay
00:03:08 I don't have the certificate where you
00:03:10 get the stamps but I do have this
00:03:15 , so you haven't really done the
00:03:17 Camino de Sant  iago didn't have it and well it's
00:03:28 like a little accordion book that you open it
00:03:31 's all united and you can put yourself
00:03:34 in every place that happens it's the night
00:03:36 when you wake up before continuing the
00:03:39 path you live
00:03:41 the stamp the stamp of this inn in that
00:03:44 hostel in
00:03:47 There are hostels in that hotel that are part of the
00:03:50 Camino de Santiago, not really, but
00:03:54 I have to say that
00:03:57 I had a very light experience, very
00:04:01 smooth. Yes, how many days? How many days
00:04:05 was it on your trip?
00:04:11 As you have told me that you already
00:04:13 started in Galicia, I thought that
00:04:16 perhaps you had done a day trip of a
00:04:18 few hours and you have already arrived and it was not
00:04:23 a few days that we did
00:04:25 between
00:04:27 15 or 16 kilometers up to 30 kilometers a
00:04:31 day between this range we were
00:04:34 and well  I went I had a very
00:04:39 particular company because I went with people who
00:04:43 are very close to me in my heart
00:04:46 but if you look at it from the outside it is a
00:04:49 very strange group
00:04:51 how many people 6 of
00:04:55 us were 6 in  We were 69 in total and I went with
00:05:00 the family of my private teacher, the
00:05:04 teacher who taught me mathematics
00:05:06 at school and with her she was her
00:05:11 private teacher of mathematics and
00:05:13 language mathematics
00:05:16 dt of everything in general the south of languages
00:05:20 taught me everything history everything  she
00:05:23 helped me with it in the mobile school she is
00:05:26 a very good person who teaches very very
00:05:28 well she is very passionate and so I went
00:05:32 with her and with her family I went with her
00:05:35 daughter her daughter's boyfriend her husband and her husband's
00:05:39 sister treated her  family
00:05:42 yes then it seemed that you were one
00:05:45 more member of his family of the family
00:05:50 so we all went together and the issue
00:05:53 is that
00:05:55 my teacher's husband was he was more
00:06:02 let's say he had more class no then
00:06:05 we didn't go to hostels hostels
00:06:07 are free no  It costs a lot of money,
00:06:10 we went to a hostel, it's
00:06:13 you, so if those
00:06:17 small merits were like a hotel but
00:06:21 less money like a hostel,
00:06:25 how are they not a total and we
00:06:29 also went to h  Roadside hotels
00:06:32 issues like this will not catch you on the road and
00:06:35 it was already reserved
00:06:37 so the first day we started the
00:06:39 road there in Ferrol
00:06:43 and it was a dog day what does that mean
00:06:47 it rained it rained let's see normal it's
00:06:51 Galicia exile a lot of football on the
00:06:55 green and so beautiful because when
00:07:00 I went to the north I had never been to the north
00:07:02 I always go to the south of Spain and when
00:07:06 I went to Galicia I was super
00:07:08 surprised I said where am I this is not
00:07:11 Spain that is all this green because the
00:07:16 United Kingdom
00:07:18 but I  I swear I didn't believe it
00:07:21 so I loved it there the first day I
00:07:25 was already in love but the first day it
00:07:28 rained a lot and the first day
00:07:32 I also innocently believed that
00:07:37 we were only going to do about 15
00:07:41 km well the road the road got
00:07:44 longer  and we end up doing 18 our
00:07:48 last three kilometers that we are going to
00:07:51 finish, we must not the one that we have already arrived, we
00:07:53 must not yet the longest three kilometers
00:07:56 of my life like this because three and three
00:07:59 kilometers  It doesn't seem like much but maybe
00:08:02 if you think you're going to get there and they
00:08:04 say oh no, it's still not
00:08:06 clear and on top of that we were wet from the
00:08:09 rain we had our backpacks and
00:08:13 the city could be seen in the distance but it wasn't
00:08:16 to get there it wasn't straight there was like  a
00:08:18 lake in the middle we had to go
00:08:20 around so you saw it there but you couldn't
00:08:24 go
00:08:27 and then that day I was carrying the
00:08:31 backpack but I have to say that I have
00:08:34 zero strength in my back I have
00:08:38 no strength and I ended up fatally destroyed
00:08:41 very badly
00:08:43 and then  You were carrying the backpack,
00:08:46 you mean you were carrying your backpack, my
00:08:49 backpack, which was the one that weighed the least,
00:08:51 weighed only seven kilos, seven miserable
00:08:54 kilos, if not, it's not much, it's nothing, and even
00:08:58 so, I ended up fatally and said I ca
00:09:01 n't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to pay the price.  Postal service,
00:09:04 although it costs me a kidney
00:09:08 to pay to send it to the next
00:09:10 hotel, the next one, indeed, it was
00:09:13 a service that the Post Office offers you, it is
00:09:16 something special on the Camino de Santiago if it
00:09:20 is very popular and you say, but yes  You're not carrying
00:09:25 your backpack, you're even doing the
00:09:27 Camino de Santiago,
00:09:29 well, that's why I said that my
00:09:32 Camino de Santiago was like a
00:09:35 very pleasant little walk,
00:09:38 apart from the first day, then it was very
00:09:40 easy
00:09:42 to see
00:09:44 and not normal. I didn't suffer, let's say I didn't
00:09:48 suffer,
00:09:50 and then  Apparently the best news
00:09:54 of my life was when they told me that it
00:09:56 only cost four euros per trip. I
00:10:00 thought it was going to be twenty euros for the
00:10:02 trip, that is, twenty euros from the
00:10:04 first hotel to the second hotel and
00:10:07 that it was going to cost me  They will take my
00:10:08 backpack to Santiago, well, 120 euros, 140
00:10:13 euros,
00:10:14 well,
00:10:16 and when we are ready, I was not
00:10:19 ready, and when I found out that I
00:10:21 am at 4 euros, I said, take all my life,
00:10:27 make them travel like a queen to
00:10:30 Madrid, and we take them to Madrid, then,
00:10:37 update  next and I with a
00:10:39 small backpack went with my food my
00:10:43 bottle of water super happy with the
00:10:45 least of us if I repeat that in the
00:10:48 big backpack we carried almost
00:10:51 nothing but the k  it emergency doctor
00:10:54 that my mother gave me,
00:10:58 although it is very very large because in my
00:11:02 backpack I
00:11:03 only had flip-flops, two t-shirts and
00:11:07 two long pants and one short and
00:11:11 little more because the mothers
00:11:13 worried a lot, much, much, much more,
00:11:16 my mother went  Being far away
00:11:18 then he worried even more and well the
00:11:22 second fantastic day the third
00:11:24 fantastic day from then on the trip was
00:11:27 very calm
00:11:29 and well I fell in love I fell in love every day with
00:11:32 the landscape that was there every day was
00:11:34 different we passed through some cities
00:11:36 through small towns for  In the middle of the forest what
00:11:40 I liked the least was going
00:11:42 up long western slopes like that because I'll get tired in
00:11:46 the north of Spain there are many mountains
00:11:48 yes there are many mountains yes but it was very
00:11:52 beautiful if there is another path which by the way
00:11:55 is through the cliffs I will have it for you
00:11:59 what to do in the future it has to be
00:12:01 impressive for a quantity and for the
00:12:03 plants I on this road do not pass
00:12:06 by the side of any beach but that it
00:12:11 passes close to  rivers yes and there is a path
00:12:15 that also passes along the coast by sea
00:12:18 yes yes the portuguese path i think i
00:12:21 was through portugal i think it also
00:12:22 passes
00:12:24 along the coast
00:12:28 the feef the most famous is that it starts in
00:12:31 france near the border with spain
00:12:36 and also  It would have to be the longest
00:12:39 officially
00:12:41 but there are many days if you want to do it
00:12:43 walking and people usually do it because
00:12:47 one year I go from France to Navarra
00:12:50 the next year I go from Navarra
00:12:53 to Cantabria and they go in sections of
00:12:56 three if you have walked
00:12:59 everywhere  Then he tells you like a trip,
00:13:03 let's say exactly, and then he tells it, it's
00:13:07 all over, you keep the little book
00:13:10 that he lost, if you keep it,
00:13:13 and he continues until the following year, he
00:13:15 can continue with the enamel with the same little
00:13:18 book
00:13:20 when you left.
00:13:23 a lot of people doing the way
00:13:27 as it is not a very popular way there
00:13:30 were not many people the English way
00:13:32 so there were people but there was not much okay
00:13:35 in that is the section that you did not
00:13:38 coincide  ide with the French way,
00:13:41 not with the French way, the French wine
00:13:45 is the one I made, the English come from
00:13:47 the coast like this and the French way comes
00:13:50 here, okay, they don't coincide, well, if there would be
00:13:53 fewer people, of course,
00:13:54 the French must be crazy, it
00:13:58 's very  Popular I know that it is very popular
00:14:00 for people from Japan, for example,
00:14:04 when I was in Japan, many people
00:14:06 knew the Camino de Santiago and I know that
00:14:09 many people are going to do it and walk
00:14:13 with some foreigners
00:14:16 and they don't usually know the Camino de
00:14:18 Santiago. I have to explain it to them.  What
00:14:20 surprises me surprises me because it is a
00:14:23 very popular thing in Spain.
00:14:26 I think that of course it is a pilgrimage route,
00:14:32 so there are many Catholics who
00:14:36 do know it and do it for
00:14:37 religious reasons,
00:14:39 but there are also many people who do it
00:14:41 simply for  The sports part is
00:14:44 for the experience part of being
00:14:47 away from home
00:14:50 for days, sleeping in a sleeping bag like
00:14:53 camping but moving every day because
00:14:56 you can also decide there is no left  You are not in
00:14:59 hotels or
00:15:02 hostels You
00:15:09 cannot stay in hotels or in
00:15:12 hostels
00:15:14 in hostels and you decide to camp by the side
00:15:17 of the road
00:15:21 I put you to sleep okay not being fulfilled
00:15:25 in a tent in Spain the
00:15:27 final tent if only in places in places
00:15:31 in campsites  and maybe you can do it
00:15:34 but of course if it's going to rain because it's
00:15:36 Galicia you don't want to sleep
00:15:39 you can't do this decisions
00:15:46 when you see that you're here if we don't recommend it
00:15:52 and because when I got to
00:15:55 [Music]
00:15:56 Santiago it
00:15:58 was a very very slow entrance because
00:16:02 we entered through the  outskirts of the city
00:16:05 and because everything is very industrial,
00:16:08 many many factories
00:16:11 and a lot of smoke, a lot of cement, which
00:16:15 also has its charm,
00:16:16 everything has its charm, I really like
00:16:19 their women, for some strange reason,
00:16:21 the industrial estates, industrial estates,
00:16:23 I think  It is because there
00:16:26 are not many people there, they are very
00:16:27 quiet places apart from the noise of the
00:16:29 machines
00:16:31 and once we passed the part of
00:16:35 the industrial estate we  We entered the
00:16:39 part of
00:16:41 the outskirts of the city, which are
00:16:44 residential
00:16:48 neighborhoods, well, not past the family residential neighborhood.
00:16:51 We entered the center of the city
00:16:55 when I arrived and I saw the cathedral of
00:16:59 Santiago de Compostela from the outside,
00:17:02 I hardly went in to see it from the inside.  I only
00:17:05 saw it from the outside because at that time I
00:17:07 was studying history of art,
00:17:10 architecture, etc., etc., and when
00:17:14 I entered the square where the
00:17:17 cathedral was located, the cathedral was
00:17:21 a little covered up, it was more or less covered up
00:17:24 because it was under construction, they were
00:17:27 fixing it up.
00:17:28 but even though it was under construction it
00:17:31 seemed so impressive to me it seemed so
00:17:33 beautiful
00:17:35 and it says something that I loved that
00:17:37 everyone in the square was doing, which
00:17:39 was to lie down on the floor of the square,
00:17:42 Francisco with the backpack there on
00:17:45 his head and simply  throw yourself down and look at
00:17:49 the cathedral that's how
00:17:51 you felt you felt illuminated a
00:17:56 lot of tranquility a lot of peace you didn't see
00:17:59 any angels
00:18:02 don't wait do
00:18:05 n't see  and no woman
00:18:06 then what is the normal thing to do you have to
00:18:09 enter the cathedral
00:18:12 normally me too if you
00:18:16 enter the cathedral you enter from the side
00:18:18 you wait for the queue because there are many people
00:18:21 who want to enter and you enter and sit down
00:18:25 and sometimes they are doing mass  there is a
00:18:27 father who is there
00:18:31 when one
00:18:37 normally there is a priest who is
00:18:39 doing the mass and
00:18:43 I did not see him because it turns out that nobody
00:18:46 paid to put it into operation
00:18:48 when I entered but when someone pays
00:18:53 there is something called a botafumeiro
00:18:57 which is a metal structure
00:19:02 inside, well, I think it has water
00:19:08 like religious water, the holy water
00:19:10 that they pour over you, it has water
00:19:14 inside if I'm not mistaken, it
00:19:18 sounds like it blows smoke, norma, that's why it's a
00:19:19 botafumeiro to anger a botafumeiro, if it
00:19:22 can also be smoke, water, I don't know  if it's
00:19:24 steam it sounds to me like it has incense
00:19:27 to stop the smell to remove a little the
00:19:30 smell of all the people that accumulates to
00:19:33 avoid standing
00:19:37 still
00:19:41 that was huge just as impressive
00:19:44 p  But I can only imagine seeing that
00:19:48 from one side to another swaying, it
00:19:52 must be scary, not only that structure
00:19:56 and well, the cathedral inside is also
00:19:58 very beautiful with very, very high ceilings
00:20:01 like cathedrals in general, which is
00:20:04 what I like the most about the  Cathedrals,
00:20:06 very high ceilings and beautiful architecture,
00:20:10 so I really like it. Also, the
00:20:14 people I went with, this family,
00:20:16 had a plane that left earlier
00:20:19 for Mallorca and mine was going to Madrid,
00:20:22 so they were different times and
00:20:25 I stayed in the city.  Alone
00:20:28 and literally cushion and mozilla and
00:20:31 I lay down again in the square and I was
00:20:33 looking at the cathedral until it was
00:20:35 time to leave
00:20:38 very beautiful the experience is like
00:20:40 reaching the top of a mountain and
00:20:43 stays there to look around looking  your
00:20:46 goal the cathedral I am here
00:20:50 I took my backpack that had brought me
00:20:53 post office
00:20:56 and well now at that moment it was
00:21:00 something I did not realize but when a
00:21:04 few years later I looked back at  my
00:21:07 experience on the camino de santiago
00:21:09 at the beginning we talked about
00:21:11 minimalism which are the penalistas
00:21:14 that is why it is the same clothes
00:21:18 but I had a moment a couple of
00:21:21 years ago in which I wanted to get rid of
00:21:25 many possessions that I did not need and
00:21:28 I looked back on my experience  on the way
00:21:30 to santiago and
00:21:32 i said i was five or six days without anything with
00:21:37 two t-shirts two pants some
00:21:40 shoes and i had no problem you
00:21:43 can live perfectly without all the
00:21:46 positions we have in reality are
00:21:48 unnecessary
00:21:50 and when i looked back at that part of the
00:21:53 road  from Santiago was something that helped me a
00:21:56 lot in that part of realizing that
00:21:59 we don't need everything we have,
00:22:02 so an experience that I remember with
00:22:05 great affection
00:22:06 is clear if it helps you to consider a
00:22:09 little perhaps the way you are living
00:22:13 and how you could live
00:22:16 and it opens up the possibilities for you a bit. I
00:22:18 believe that many experiences in
00:22:20 life open up the possibilities for us, what we
00:22:24 consider to be possible
00:22:28 I agree  that they have had some
00:22:30 experience like this, well then maybe
00:22:33 camping and hitchhiking for
00:22:38 four months
00:22:41 and this is good I have already told it
00:22:43 in some video I am not going to repeat it
00:22:46 here but I was in Japan for four
00:22:48 months hitchhiking
00:22:50 and it was also good for me  think about
00:22:53 many things and I don't know it was a
00:22:57 very very good experience
00:22:59 it made
00:23:02 me appreciate much more because the kindness
00:23:05 of people appreciate humanity now
00:23:08 now with the issue of kobe and such has
00:23:12 lost everything
00:23:14 and all my hopes in humanity
00:23:17 but until then the  I had had
00:23:22 but well thanks for telling us this
00:23:25 because I would also like to do the
00:23:28 Camino de Santiago to do it one day
00:23:32 it will not be decided according to the level of difficulty
00:23:35 you want if according to the time you have
00:23:39 available
00:23:40 good but you can always cut it
00:23:43 in half  I walk if you only have a
00:23:45 body days later I go here and
00:23:47 next they change in the future if I have a
00:23:50 time in Spain that I am there in Spain well
00:23:52 I would like to h  do it
00:23:55 and thank you very much as in all your
00:23:59 videos we will leave below a link to your
00:24:02 channel what is your channel called
00:24:04 after hours I know that the work
00:24:08 also teaches with an understandable and
00:24:11 good input thank you very much and I hope you come
00:24:13 more times in the future
00:24:16 and help us to  record videos
00:24:26 ah
00:24:28 ah
00:24:30 [Music]
",3
222,"00:00:00 and after the civil war
00:00:04 the long long dictatorship of franco began
00:00:11 [Music]
00:00:14 hello, yes, as I told you in the video of
00:00:19 the civil war, the civil war ends and
00:00:23 this leads to many changes,
00:00:26 many things change in Spain, not franco comes
00:00:33 to power  franco is the dictator of the
00:00:37 dictatorship of the dictatorship of
00:00:39 course francisco franco not sometimes
00:00:42 also called the caudillo so
00:00:46 as always there were parts of the
00:00:50 population that were in favor and that
00:00:54 were against in favor of franco
00:00:57 we had the army
00:01:01 yes it is a tank um  I don't know if it's very
00:01:06 clear the army the church the
00:01:10 catholic church the phalanx the phalanx was the
00:01:14 fascist political party not with
00:01:18 fascist ideas something like that they are arrows the
00:01:22 phalanx and then the technocrats the
00:01:26 technocrats I'm going to draw them like this the
00:01:29 technocrats are
00:01:32 administrative professionals of the  government with positions
00:01:35 in the government administration in the
00:01:38 ministers these were in favor of the
00:01:41 francs they supported the francs against
00:01:44 we have the partisans  The
00:01:50 old pre-war left-wing politicians although
00:01:53 at this time they were banned and
00:01:57 only continued to exist
00:02:00 unofficially in
00:02:01 hiding we don't have the
00:02:04 Socialist Party Spanish Socialist Workers
00:02:07 Party the Communist Party of Spain and the
00:02:11 National
00:02:14 Workers' Labor Commission then another group that  I did not
00:02:18 support Franco, the monarchists were
00:02:21 the people who wanted there to be a
00:02:25 king in Spain because with the Francos there was
00:02:28 no king, then the guerrillas too.
00:02:38 the
00:02:42 mountains normally and from time to time they kept
00:02:45 fighting trying well to
00:02:48 continue trying to win the war it's
00:02:52 good that there wasn't really anymore they were
00:02:54 called the maquis the maquis movement
00:02:58 are these guerrillas these
00:03:01 guerrillas who stayed in the
00:03:04 mountains and for a while kept
00:03:07 trying well  fight against the
00:03:11 dictatorship sometimes even entering from
00:03:14 france bringing people from france
00:03:17 but then they were not
00:03:21 really successful they tried to get some country to
00:03:24 help them to a foreign country some
00:03:27 european country to help them but they didn't
00:03:30 get it so another group
00:03:33 also against the francs were the
00:03:36 republicans the people who wanted
00:03:39 a republic  that they did not want a
00:03:42 monarchy but that before the
00:03:45 war they wanted a republic without without a king
00:03:47 not then who defended the regime that
00:03:52 Franco defended and his regime
00:03:55 was patriotism first is to love the homeland to
00:03:59 love your country not to love Spain long live
00:04:02 spain' of spain was a single country
00:04:05 spain was a united country without different
00:04:10 nationalities or without different states
00:04:13 with their own with their own freedom
00:04:16 to create laws and such not anything like that and
00:04:20 that it was a traditional country after the
00:04:23 second was catholicism
00:04:26 catholic christian  who defended the
00:04:31 traditional morality of Catholicism and then
00:04:35 anti-communism to be against the
00:04:38 communists and communism and in  against
00:04:41 the liberalism of seeking a
00:04:44 freer society without the weight of Catholic morality
00:04:48 with more modern ideas and such
00:04:52 were not also against the Jews
00:04:56 and the communists and communists yes
00:05:01 I understand the Jews I don't know if at that
00:05:04 time there really were  almost jews in
00:05:07 spain because a few centuries ago they were
00:05:10 expelled i don't know in practice if
00:05:13 something was done against the jews but in case it
00:05:18 was rather something for sharing ideas
00:05:21 with germany with the nazi party and
00:05:25 such and such but against the communists
00:05:28 and the  communists continued to be
00:05:30 persecuted after the war
00:05:32 they were also against
00:05:35 democracy the dictatorship of franco did not
00:05:38 want democracy and during the dictatorship
00:05:41 there was also no freedom of expression they
00:05:44 were against freedom of
00:05:47 expression they even imposed censorship
00:05:50 during the dictatorship the books that were published
00:05:53 published and the films that were
00:05:56 shown in the cinema had to be
00:05:58 censored they had to go through a
00:06:01 sensor the sensor decided if  it could be
00:06:04 shown or if it could not be shown and if it was
00:06:07 shown which parts had to be removed by
00:06:10 removing things like or that a woman
00:06:13 's leg is visible without wearing
00:06:16 shorts or something like that, no, many things
00:06:20 were removed for the version that  it was
00:06:23 shown in spain then at the beginning
00:06:26 of Francoism the falange the party of
00:06:31 the falange is the one that has the most power the one
00:06:34 that has the most influence
00:06:37 and then
00:06:39 there was also ramón serrano súñer
00:06:43 ramón serrano súñer
00:06:46 was the brother-in-law of franco and at the beginning
00:06:50 of the dictatorship he was also a  an
00:06:53 important figure later I will tell you a little more
00:06:56 about him then at the beginning of the dictatorship
00:07:00 the phalanx creates the constitutive law of
00:07:04 the courts the courts is the government it
00:07:08 is not where
00:07:11 politicians meet to discuss depending on the
00:07:15 country it can be a senate a parliament
00:07:18 these are the  courts basically no
00:07:20 senate parliaments and there are although at
00:07:23 this moment this is a chamber not a
00:07:26 chamber still one the courts a room
00:07:28 with a lot of people that basically  Cally it is
00:07:31 at the service of Franco, it is to do
00:07:34 to decide what Franco has already
00:07:36 decided and wants no and the beginning of
00:07:40 the dictatorship is very marked by the
00:07:43 Second World War
00:07:45 if the sure the Second World War
00:07:48 of the Nazis against the allies or the  lg
00:07:52 not the axis of evil against the
00:07:55 allies then at the beginning of the
00:07:58 second world war frank says that
00:08:01 spain is neutral that spain does not get involved
00:08:04 in the war that happens in
00:08:08 1940 frank or sees that the nazis are
00:08:13 winning a lot they are winning many
00:08:15 battles  They are invading many countries, he
00:08:18 sees that they have a lot of power and he changes his
00:08:23 mind, he decides that they are going to ally with
00:08:26 the Nazis, so
00:08:29 Franco commands the blue division, which was, well,
00:08:33 an army, there were 18,000 people,
00:08:38 18,000 volunteers, in principle, they were
00:08:42 volunteers, people who
00:08:44 wanted to go.  they went
00:08:47 against the soviet union in russia on the
00:08:52 side of the germans together with the
00:08:54 germans but in this battle in this
00:08:58 battle in russia they did very well  It
00:09:01 was going very badly for them and Franco said
00:09:04 no no no no, we're not at war anymore and
00:09:07 Spain was neutral again and
00:09:11 then Franco fired his brother-in-law his
00:09:15 brother-in-law was a friend of the Nazis and he was
00:09:19 fired by Kita, he took his job  his
00:09:22 job not so at the end
00:09:26 of the second world war the nazis
00:09:29 lose they lose the war and the phalanx
00:09:32 that supported them that was friends of the
00:09:35 nazis well they lost importance
00:09:39 they became less important in the
00:09:42 government to have less influence over
00:09:45 franco  and this time it is the church that
00:09:49 happens to have more influence then
00:09:53 national-catholicism stands the
00:09:56 movement of nationalism in spain
00:09:58 together with catholicism with the
00:10:01 catholic church but after the second
00:10:05 world war spain begins to be
00:10:09 rejected by other european countries  no
00:10:12 other european countries begin to
00:10:16 reject spain saying that it is a
00:10:20 dictatorship the other countries condemned
00:10:23 that spain was a dictatorship spain did not
00:10:26 enter the un  or I did not enter the
00:10:30 united nations not many ambassadors
00:10:34 ambassadors of other countries who were
00:10:37 in the embassies of their country in madrid left they
00:10:40 were withdrawn from the embassies
00:10:43 france closed the border france
00:10:49 closed the border then during the
00:10:52 beginning of the dictatorship spain was
00:10:55 quite
00:10:56 autarchic there was autarky which
00:11:00 means that Spain was isolated and had
00:11:04 to produce its own resources they had
00:11:07 to grow their own food make
00:11:10 their own make everything themselves
00:11:14 because
00:11:17 imports from abroad from other
00:11:20 countries were very limited so as Spain came from a
00:11:25 war and already  it was bad with this
00:11:27 situation it was even worse and well it is
00:11:32 known as the years of hunger because
00:11:35 many people went hungry the situation of
00:11:38 the economy well it was very bad the
00:11:41 economy was very bad but then
00:11:43 came the cold war the cold war not
00:11:48 against the soviet union
00:11:50 And in the 1950s, in the
00:11:54 1950s and around the 1950s, the US began to
00:12:00 consider Spain c  As an ally because
00:12:03 Spain was also against
00:12:06 communism and because of this the
00:12:09 other countries other European countries
00:12:12 begin to give in a little with Spain they
00:12:16 begin to make some treaties and
00:12:19 perhaps at this time there is a change
00:12:23 the law of succession is created  why
00:12:28 franco decides that spain is a
00:12:31 monarchy in spain if spain is a
00:12:34 monarchy there is a king no no there is no king but
00:12:38 there will be when franco dies the
00:12:41 next person who will be the head of
00:12:43 state will be the king but not for
00:12:46 now only  flank what happens that
00:12:49 with a country that is governed above
00:12:52 all by the church, not by good politicians,
00:12:56 not by people who are
00:12:59 good at managing the state of the
00:13:02 economy and such, many people begin to
00:13:06 tire of people against Francoism
00:13:09 but  people in favor of
00:13:11 Francoism also begin to see clashes
00:13:15 between the church and the phalanx so
00:13:19 Franco decides to give more power to the
00:13:23 technocrats give more power to people
00:13:26 who by  At least they know something about managing the
00:13:30 country's economy and such and the technocrats
00:13:33 decide to create more laws, one of them is
00:13:37 the organic law of the state, it is a law
00:13:41 that says in the future as if well
00:13:45 when Franco dies even at that
00:13:47 moment from now on and  In the future,
00:13:50 what will the structure of the government be? It is
00:13:54 headed by the head of state and the president
00:13:58 of the government and the head of state would be like
00:14:01 the president of the republic and the
00:14:04 president of the government is like the
00:14:07 prime minister in other countries he is called the
00:14:10 prime minister then  the successor of
00:14:14 franco the one who would be the head of state
00:14:16 after franco is chosen juan
00:14:20 carlos de borbón the one who has to read more
00:14:23 ahead would be the king juan carlos juan carlos is
00:14:26 chosen as the future
00:14:29 king but the father of juan carlos still
00:14:33 he was still alive he was not dead
00:14:36 but they did not choose him as king because his
00:14:41 father was a liberal his father did not
00:14:44 agree with the more traditional ideas
00:14:47 of Francoism then in government
00:14:49 with l  The technocrats were also the
00:14:54 immobilists, people who did not want to
00:14:57 change anything, they wanted everything to stay the
00:14:59 same, and the openers, the people
00:15:03 who wanted to open the regime more to the
00:15:07 outside world, to have contact with other
00:15:10 countries, to have more imports,
00:15:13 exports, make it
00:15:16 easier to travel, promote  tourism in
00:15:19 spain during these frank years the
00:15:23 years of the frank technocrats wants to
00:15:27 recover gibraltar
00:15:29 gibraltar which is now british is now
00:15:33 from the united kingdom- franco wants to
00:15:36 recover it but is unable to and also
00:15:39 spain loses several possessions spain
00:15:44 loses
00:15:45 equatorial guinea loses equatorial guinea
00:15:47 which  it became independent in
00:15:52 1968 it became an
00:15:54 independent country and the western sahara which
00:15:58 spain abandoned in
00:16:02 1975 spain left the sahara
00:16:06 then we reached the last stage the
00:16:10 last phase of the dictatorship which is the
00:16:13 decline the decline of the regime then
00:16:17 it began  to carrero blanco' in charge of the
00:16:21 government
00:16:22 carrero blanco' tries to rela  Launching the
00:16:25 economy tries to improve the economy
00:16:28 of Spain and signed
00:16:30 trade treaties with China,
00:16:35 even with many countries, including
00:16:38 many European countries, but even with
00:16:41 China and with East Germany, which was
00:16:46 communist at that time,
00:16:48 the education system changed, and in
00:16:54 1959 it is possible to fix the economy quite a bit
00:16:58 it is possible for the
00:17:02 prices of things to stabilize and
00:17:05 remain stable it is possible
00:17:08 for the peseta exchange rate the peseta exchange rate
00:17:12 the peseta was the currency
00:17:15 used in Spain- it is possible for the
00:17:18 exchange rate of the peseta, well, with the
00:17:20 franc or with the mark with the pound that
00:17:24 was more or less stable and thanks to
00:17:28 this there is also beginning to be more tourism,
00:17:31 the tourism of foreigners
00:17:34 who come on a trip to Spain increases a lot and the
00:17:38 first investments begin
00:17:40 Let's see people, companies outside of Spain, that
00:17:43 begin to invest money in Spain and
00:17:46 what happens from this moment on is
00:17:49 known as the economic miracle.
00:17:52 Because the economy improved a lot during this
00:17:56 time, many foreign companies opened
00:17:58 in Spain,
00:18:00 taking advantage of the fact that wages in Spain
00:18:03 were very low, that the salaries were very
00:18:06 low, they had to pay the workers little,
00:18:08 and since they opened so many
00:18:11 companies, this caused many people to
00:18:14 go to  living from the countryside to the cidh and the
00:18:18 cities began to grow,
00:18:21 many residential neighborhoods were created in the
00:18:24 cities, many
00:18:26 industrial estates were also created with many
00:18:29 factories, and as tourism increased a lot
00:18:32 , many hotels were also built,
00:18:36 so like the Spaniards, we began to
00:18:39 have more money.  to be more
00:18:42 consumerists we began to buy more clothes
00:18:46 to buy cars televisions and
00:18:50 society began to change and people
00:18:53 began to look more towards Europe they
00:18:56 began to see the freedoms that
00:18:59 the rest of Europeans had we
00:19:02 began to compare ourselves and more people
00:19:05 began to ask  who wanted to be more
00:19:07 like the rest of europe began to
00:19:10 p  eding more freedoms and for this
00:19:13 the university students were very important the
00:19:16 university protests the
00:19:19 demonstrations
00:19:21 what the university students did even
00:19:24 riots at some point he came to
00:19:26 see confrontations with the police and
00:19:29 deaths then in general the whole
00:19:32 society was evolving and the ideas
00:19:36 of Francoism the principles  of
00:19:38 Francoism they were falling or were
00:19:41 losing importance even some
00:19:44 members of the church some people
00:19:47 of the church began to support some
00:19:50 movements of the workers of the
00:19:54 parties of workers of the psoe cnt
00:19:56 etc. and at this moment both the
00:19:59 parties of the right and those of the
00:20:01 left
00:20:02 began  to get a little tired of
00:20:05 Francoism then also in
00:20:09 1959 something important happens which is that
00:20:13 the terrorist group eta eta is created it is a
00:20:17 terrorist group in favor of the
00:20:19 independence of the Basque country
00:20:22 well right now in spain the community
00:20:26 of the Basque country is this but eta would
00:20:29 consider  who wanted
00:20:31 independence  cia from the Basque Country, Navarra and the
00:20:35 French Basque Country or something like that
00:20:38 and it is in addition to many other attacks
00:20:43 in
00:20:44 1973
00:20:46 eta kills carrero blanco' yes it was a
00:20:51 very famous attack because they planted a
00:20:54 bomb and when their car passed they
00:20:57 blew it up and the car flew very  stop
00:20:59 then well many
00:21:02 jokes have also been made about the murder of
00:21:05 carrero blanco but basically in
00:21:08 73 carrero blanco dies' this seems to
00:21:12 affect franco franco was no longer in very
00:21:16 good health he was quite old and it
00:21:19 seems that with the death of carrero
00:21:21 White's health gets even worse
00:21:25 so it can be put in a new
00:21:28 president of the government Arias Navarro
00:21:32 Arias Navarro tries to change the law
00:21:35 to allow political parties
00:21:39 surely with certain limitations and
00:21:42 such but to allow
00:21:44 other political parties to exist
00:21:47 the phalanx the phalanx will  He doesn't want to complain
00:21:50 and Franco says no, it's not going to be
00:21:53 done, so the
00:21:55 international situation doesn't help Francoism much either.
00:21:58 Portugal h  until recently they
00:22:01 also had a dictator like we
00:22:04 had the francs they had a dictator and
00:22:06 they got rid of him now they no longer
00:22:09 had a dictator then the
00:22:11 spanish government executes executes members of
00:22:15 eta members of eta who detain and
00:22:17 then apply the death penalty and  The
00:22:21 international community complains about this
00:22:24 and soon after, at the age of 82, at the
00:22:28 age of 82, Franco
00:22:33 dies.
00:22:52 They would all go against the
00:22:55 Francoist movement and they decided that the easiest
00:22:59 thing that would have the least problems would be to
00:23:03 accept Juan Carlos as the King of
00:23:06 Spain. So in
00:23:08 1975
00:23:10 Francoism officially ended and
00:23:14 the transition to democracy began, which
00:23:18 I will explain to you in the following video,
00:23:20 okay  come bye
00:23:25 don't forget to visit the
00:23:29 dream in spanish website you will be able to see how many

00:00:07 here again with my friend adrián and today
00:00:12 adrià and I are not friends no no no no
00:00:17 because we have a different opinion
00:00:22 we do not think the same no no no
00:00:25 today we are going to have a debate a debate

00:00:39 to me but instead of it's better yes there
00:00:44 would be he's going to say that ve is better better
00:00:47 than a but I think not that a is better
00:00:52 so today we're going  to choose to choose
00:00:57 between two options the first is
00:01:03 the cape the harry potter cape do you know harry
00:01:07 potter no well with this cape when
00:01:10 harry potter puts it on the other
00:01:15 people no people don't see it no no no

00:01:24 no one sees it or how interesting no
00:01:27 how good it's good it's not bad
00:01:30 but for me there is another option
00:01:34 that I like more would be the broom the
00:01:37 flying broom from harry potter no more
00:01:41 the broom is the broom
00:01:43 the broom that he uses to  fly exactly
00:01:48 there is another option with this scale you can
00:01:51 fly  lar no harry potter use the broom to
00:01:55 fly
00:01:57 you if you had to
00:02:00 choose between let's see which one would
00:02:04 jce choose write write below which of the
00:02:07 two would jce choose and because I
00:02:12 like the cape the cape better to be
00:02:15 invisible yes yes but because  new pablo
00:02:20 I like the broom more I
00:02:22 have it very clear also for me it is
00:02:24 very clear the broom is better no no no it
00:02:28 is not that the cape is better because you can
00:02:32 clearly see who was developed with the cape
00:02:35 you can only do bad things
00:02:38 bad of course you can spy for example
00:02:42 Pablo don't give me and I look at what the angel
00:02:46 I'm spying on
00:02:48 I speak like for example spying or not
00:02:51 through as if through a hole
00:02:53 for example to well yes for example I
00:02:57 could with the cape go to  spy and spy
00:03:02 on terrorists game spy on russia
00:03:07 or on his girls or spy on the
00:03:12 girls
00:03:14 on the girls too no
00:03:17 but no no no the girls is a bad thing about
00:03:21 her but of course imagine now you
00:03:24 have this cape now I want to have
00:03:26 the layer that safe sector surely you
00:03:30 would do this I maybe I would spy I
00:03:34 would hit the girls but it's hard to
00:03:36 control you but it's very good if
00:03:40 we can spy on terrorists or
00:03:43 spy on our enemies it's not a
00:03:48 good thing for us good stop
00:03:50 for the country  now the world hadn't
00:03:54 thought of it like that I hadn't thought of it
00:03:56 like that but it would be very dangerous not one day
00:04:00 she threw it maybe she linked it so for me she
00:04:04 exactly over there yes dangerous
00:04:06 jonathan they removed they hurt me they could
00:04:09 kill me but I am very brave  I
00:04:14 would do it anyway I understand but for me
00:04:17 going to the broom would be a lot of fun
00:04:18 imagine better than covas because because
00:04:21 the broom is better for sigen
00:04:23 I you are very generous you think
00:04:27 of other people and I think of
00:04:30 people see you later good for people
00:04:32 me  I think of myself I am selfish I am selfish I
00:04:35 only think of myself and then
00:04:39 a broom would be very fun very
00:04:42 fast although it is fun of course not
00:04:46 because flying balls can fast this is
00:04:51 flying  I don't know where, because
00:04:55 if I flew, it would be the police, of course,
00:04:59 the police wouldn't of course, the police would see it
00:05:03 and stop it, it's possible or you can't
00:05:06 fly, man, but it takes them, maybe
00:05:09 maybe I can go to the mountains maybe you
00:05:12 can go to the mountains  in the mountains to the
00:05:14 countryside and flying exactly to stop there
00:05:17 would be great fun but it's very
00:05:19 dangerous
00:05:21 you could fall and break an arm
00:05:24 break your neck which is also having a
00:05:27 job I
00:05:31 could bring a date a dollar for the
00:05:35 blanket to a date adrià I could bring
00:05:40 a  not a date and both of us here to
00:05:45 fly
00:05:47 like aladdin so much so much
00:05:57 very well
00:06:02 but if you had the cape
00:06:06 you don't need the broom I
00:06:10 could put on the cape go to my
00:06:17 date's house
00:06:18 and then I take off the cape surprise
00:06:28 the problems  they had to finish with the
00:06:33 cape when you go to school
00:06:36 you're not going to go to school
00:06:40 you go to school but you're late
00:06:43 you arrive at ten past nine not at
00:06:48 school there is the teacher and if he sees you he
00:06:51 will go adrián adrián because already more  It's late and he's
00:06:54 late
00:06:55 haha ​​but if I have the cape I don't wear
00:06:58 the cape I go to school I go to
00:07:01 class I sit down and when the teacher isn't
00:07:05 looking they
00:07:07 have always been here they have always been
00:07:14 here I find it difficult difficult to carry out
00:07:18 difficult to do but it is possible
00:07:22 but a broom an advantage I am an
00:07:24 advantage and a disadvantage not but an
00:07:27 advantage something good an advantage blasco goes
00:07:30 that's why you can also shout it
00:07:32 to sweep at home the parents also
00:07:35 have it has two uses you can fly
00:07:39 and  you can take
00:07:41 adriano you have you don't have you
00:07:47 can go to work with the context you are going
00:07:51 you can of course because in barcelona there is a
00:07:54 lot of traffic there are many there are many cars
00:07:59 and with the broom you can go faster it
00:08:01 is very good more than by bike more if you
00:08:06 are not well but with  the cape haha
00:08:09 I can put on the cape and get into a
00:08:14 taxi
00:08:18 and you put a cape in a taxi or a
00:08:22 taxi and from which they got out and the taxi and
00:08:26 when I see that it's close I start to
00:08:29 make a
00:08:34 stiff noise noise of a mo  tor that it doesn't
00:08:38 work well between the gentleman then the
00:08:42 taxi driver stopped
00:08:45 walshe so that I imagine and see I'll see
00:08:47 what happens to the pp while he looks at the engine I
00:08:50 get out the president argued this
00:08:58 argument is very good yes it is something
00:09:04 very very good also if I have  the cape
00:09:07 I can hide go steal
00:09:14 Adrià's broom
00:09:16 I have the cape and the broom
00:09:22 I don't have anything to counteract this
00:09:26 like this araujo in three big it is true that
00:09:29 the broom is very very funny
00:09:34 me too since I was little I
00:09:36 wanted to fly to be able to fly of
00:09:39 course yes  He doesn't want to erase, well, it's because
00:09:43 you've disappeared. It's been fun. I
00:09:47 don't think it's used to be a bit difficult to
00:09:51 understand, but hey, that's between
00:09:55 you, who have a better level,
00:09:57 maybe you've had fun for
00:10:00 orange students, well,
00:10:03 nothing.

00:10:34 the gods it is hard to do it for gm because
00:10:38 you can make it
00:10:42 clear that you can do
",3
214,"00:00:00 Well it seems that the situation with the
00:00:03 commit is improving more and more people are
00:00:07 vaccinated and perhaps you have started to
00:00:12 think about going to a country where they speak
00:00:16 Spanish to improve your Spanish and
00:00:21 today I am going to talk about the best
00:00:25 places in Spain to learn Spanish
00:00:32 [  Music]
00:00:35 Hello, well, yes, if you have started to make
00:00:41 plans to go and spend some time in
00:00:44 Spain to improve your Spanish, today
00:00:48 I am going to explain the differences between
00:00:53 different cities and which are the
00:00:57 best ones to learn Spanish. We are going to
00:01:00 start with the most obvious ones.
00:01:04 well-known
00:01:05 that are madrid madrid and barcelona
00:01:09 then madrid and barcelona above all
00:01:12 I am going to explain why I think they
00:01:17 are not good ideas not madrid and barcelona-
00:01:21 they do have one good thing and that is that they
00:01:24 are very practical places to live in
00:01:27 madrid in barcelona you have  of everything
00:01:30 you have shows you will have
00:01:34 when when the situation is better
00:01:37 you will have events you have many festivals
00:01:41 you have many job opportunities and
00:01:44 such but  If what you want is to
00:01:48 concentrate on learning Spanish,
00:01:51 they are probably not the best option. The
00:01:54 first reason, the main reason
00:01:59 why they are not the best place, is that there are
00:02:02 many foreigners, there are many people from
00:02:05 abroad, many people who speak English and it is
00:02:09 very easy to survive
00:02:12 in  madrid- goods and in barcelona without
00:02:15 speaking spanish without the need to speak
00:02:19 spanish so this is the reason why
00:02:23 i don't recommend it many foreigners
00:02:26 travel to spain or live in spain and
00:02:30 form a bubble around them of
00:02:34 people who speak
00:02:37 english with  and they find a way to live
00:02:41 there without needing to speak Spanish and in
00:02:45 Barcelona and Madrid it's easier,
00:02:49 so I don't recommend it. Another reason is that
00:02:52 Barcelona and Madrid are expensive, they are
00:02:55 expensive cities, renting the apartment
00:02:59 will cost you more money, and well, there is
00:03:03 Various things Going out to eat Going out to have a
00:03:06 drink too Normally it will cost you
00:03:08 more money in these two cities
00:03:11 Barcelona also has an
00:03:15 additional problem which is Catalan  No, then
00:03:19 in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands,
00:03:23 Catalan is spoken in Barcelona, ​​so if you
00:03:27 talk to people, many people will speak
00:03:29 Spanish, there are more people who speak
00:03:31 Spanish in Barcelona, ​​but you
00:03:35 will see many things written in Catalan
00:03:38 when you go down the street, and you may see
00:03:41 things written.  Being that sometimes
00:03:44 you don't know if what you see is Catalan or
00:03:47 Spanish can be good and above all
00:03:50 you will be less immersed in the language
00:03:54 you will have fewer opportunities to read
00:03:58 Spanish when you are walking down the
00:04:01 street no it is not a very big disadvantage
00:04:04 but it is  a bit of a disadvantage
00:04:07 then a city that is
00:04:11 often recommended is valladolid here
00:04:15 valladolid and valladolid is fine it is a
00:04:19 city that is not very big if you like it
00:04:24 where there is not a lot of noise a lot of noise a
00:04:28 lot
00:04:30 too many people maybe a place that is also
00:04:33 cheaper than  It doesn't cost so much money.
00:04:36 Valladolid is quite good. Of the
00:04:39 cities I'm going to talk about today,
00:04:42 Valladolid is surely the city with
00:04:46 fewer people who speak English so
00:04:50 here you can really be immersed in
00:04:54 it in Spanish and also the
00:04:58 way they speak the Spanish that they speak
00:05:00 is within Spain it is quite standard it
00:05:03 is a form quite similar to
00:05:07 the standard language to the language of
00:05:11 television perhaps and what  The last thing is that it is
00:05:14 close to Madrid you can go to Madrid during the day
00:05:17 to visit Madrid and then at
00:05:21 night go back to Valladolid to
00:05:23 sleep no so I think it is something
00:05:27 interesting
00:05:28 Salamanca Salamanca the same as Valladolid they
00:05:32 speak Spanish also quite
00:05:35 standard It is also close to Madrid
00:05:38 You can take trips to Madrid and also
00:05:42 Salamanca is a very interesting city
00:05:47 to see, very interesting to visit, there are
00:05:50 many historical buildings, it has a
00:05:54 university that was surely the
00:05:58 first university in Spain and I don't know if it was
00:06:02 even in a larger area, but
00:06:05 Salamanca is one  A very beautiful city,
00:06:07 it is also a place with many
00:06:10 students, many Spanish students come,
00:06:14 but  There are also many
00:06:17 foreign students so it
00:06:21 is easier to find people who speak
00:06:25 English in Salamanca so another is
00:06:28 Valencia Valencia so Valencia let's see
00:06:33 clearly how Barcelona is on the sea no
00:06:36 and if you like the sea it's something very
00:06:39 good and maybe only because you  Like
00:06:43 the sea, do you prefer to live in Barcelona
00:06:46 or Valencia then in Valencia when they
00:06:50 speak Spanish they also speak
00:06:53 very standard Spanish I don't think you will
00:06:56 find many many differences and yes
00:06:59 they do speak Catalan which they call it
00:07:02 Valencian yes it is called Catalan or yes
00:07:05 that catalan or valencian is spoken but
00:07:07 less than in catalonia especially
00:07:11 in the city and yes i think it is still
00:07:15 a good option both in barcelona and
00:07:18 in valencia you will hear that spanish is spoken more
00:07:22 than catalan but if you live
00:07:25 outside the city  If you go to other
00:07:27 nearby cities, Catalan or Valencian will be spoken much more
00:07:31 then
00:07:34 and it is better that you do not go to a place in
00:07:37 Catalonia or Valencia that you do not see  you go to
00:07:40 live in small cities or small towns
00:07:43 because most of them could be in
00:07:47 catalan no so we have two
00:07:50 cities left in andalusia we have granada
00:07:55 granada and seville granada and seville let's
00:07:59 see what's good about them well they are
00:08:02 close to the sea they are also quite
00:08:05 close to the sea  So you can go on the
00:08:08 weekend or you can go one day to the beach
00:08:11 and enjoy the sea and then the
00:08:14 Andalusians, the people of Andalusia are
00:08:17 very nice people who really like to
00:08:20 go out with friends, go for a drink, go
00:08:24 to the disco, I don't know.  they like to
00:08:27 have a good time they are very nice people
00:08:30 very good and nice depending on the
00:08:35 type of people you like then
00:08:37 well these are
00:08:40 good things the spanish spoken in
00:08:42 andalusia is quite different from the
00:08:46 standard spanish
00:08:49 of the standard spanish of the iberian peninsula' but the
00:08:52 pronunciation  It looks a bit like the
00:08:56 Latin American dialects so
00:08:59 well in the end it's Spanish and if you
00:09:02 learn it you can also understand other
00:09:06 types of Spanish.  ol but you know that what
00:09:09 is spoken is not the most
00:09:11 standard Spanish in Spain but good to live
00:09:14 to live there I think that they are
00:09:17 good options so
00:09:19 taking into account knowing what I have
00:09:23 explained to you tell me which
00:09:27 would be the best place in  What city in
00:09:30 Spain would you like to live in and tell me if
00:09:34 you have experience living in a
00:09:37 city in Spain or living in a
00:09:40 city in Latin America, tell us your
00:09:44 experience

00:00:05 hello everyone and all of you, I'm 24
00:00:09 years old, I'm from Madrid and I live and work in
00:00:11 Madrid as a Spanish teacher.
00:00:25 for you
00:00:26 above all to avoid
00:00:29 possible misunderstandings cultural misunderstandings well
00:00:33 therefore we are going to work on some
00:00:35 topics about Spanish but we are
00:00:37 going to do it in parallel so that
00:00:40 you learn new vocabulary and
00:00:43 we are going to do it working with
00:00:46 colloquial or very common expressions and
00:00:49 that in addition  If you are in Spain it is
00:00:51 quite frequent or it is possible that
00:00:53 you can excuse me
00:00:57 to listen in agreement I am sure that when I
00:01:02 said stereotypes many ideas
00:01:06 about the Spanish about Spanish topics
00:01:08 have come to your head I am
00:01:11 sure that among them was the
00:01:16 Spanish love to party
00:01:19 Spaniards drink sangria and eat country
00:01:23 every weekend.  it's the week the
00:01:25 spanish people love flamenco and
00:01:28 also they all know how to
00:01:31 play the guitar perfectly
00:01:34 also the spanish are very noisy and
00:01:38 speak very loud
00:01:39 well some of them were among
00:01:43 your ideas
00:01:45 well not mine today we are going to
00:01:49 focus specifically on 22
00:01:52 stereotypes
00:01:54 the first one we Spaniards are really
00:01:57 cardones
00:02:00 well what does it mean to be late or a
00:02:03 person does it mean to be late I am going to
00:02:08 give you a very simple example it is worth
00:02:12 to see it I am punctual when
00:02:15 I arrive late if I meet my friends
00:02:17 one day to go to  to have a drink and I arrive 30
00:02:22 minutes later
00:02:26 my friends but not just once
00:02:31 repeatedly this is even always
00:02:35 my angry friends can come to
00:02:39 tell me
00:02:39 Lorena you are always late Lorena you are
00:02:42 late
00:02:47 I agree I would also like to talk to you about the
00:02:49 concept of time for  Spaniards
00:02:54 agree for us the concept of
00:02:56 time
00:02:58 is very broad it is very flexible
00:03:02 while for us it is like that  For other
00:03:04 cultures this is unthinkable, that is, it is a
00:03:07 lack of education, it is disrespectful, it is not up
00:03:11 to date and even before, it is the
00:03:16 social convention, it is culturally
00:03:19 correct and
00:03:22 established accordingly,
00:03:24 this is different from one country to another,
00:03:27 therefore we have to be very clear  that it is
00:03:29 a convention it is a cultural idea that
00:03:32 is
00:03:34 already agreed within us countries
00:03:39 in which it is really important to be
00:03:42 punctual I don't know right now the USA comes
00:03:45 to mind
00:03:46 but mainly England with
00:03:49 its British time its British punctuality
00:03:51 and also Germany a  Japan,
00:03:55 but not all countries, as you know,
00:03:58 have this strict concept of punctuality,
00:04:02 there are no others,
00:04:06 including Spain, where, as I just
00:04:08 told you, it is much more flexible. In fact, in
00:04:11 Spain, if you arrive between 10-15 minutes,
00:04:14 well, within what  nothing happens
00:04:18 but if you arrive more than 15 minutes and
00:04:22 even half an hour late from the time
00:04:25 established in the appointment and to the people
00:04:28 with whom you have  It's the appointments, the appointment,
00:04:31 sorry, it may look a bit bad to you,
00:04:34 well,
00:04:36 that is, we are flexible, okay, but I
00:04:40 do not want you to think that I am complaining
00:04:43 that we are disrespectful, agree,
00:04:48 this phenomenon of lateness
00:04:51 is very, very related to,
00:04:54 mainly, a bad organization of
00:04:56 time and  In a little bit, in a few
00:04:58 minutes, I'm going to give you a very
00:05:00 clear, very simple example so that we
00:05:02 understand it so that we understand
00:05:05 what I'm talking about when I say bad
00:05:07 organization
00:05:09 and secondly,
00:05:13 it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen in all
00:05:15 contexts of our lives, it can be
00:05:18 that we relax and be more
00:05:22 late when we have appointments with
00:05:25 friends but it is true that in
00:05:28 formal and serious contexts such as
00:05:31 work
00:05:35 I normally say normally because this is already very
00:05:38 personal and there are different ways of thinking and
00:05:42 seeing things depending on the
00:05:46 person but normally the Spanish
00:05:48 at work are very respectful and
00:05:52 responsible and even
00:05:56 punctual, we would say okay, that is, this
00:06:00 phenomenon of lateness that I already told you, there
00:06:04 may be exceptions and it can occur in
00:06:08 both professional and personal contexts,
00:06:11 but normally it tends to occur more
00:06:15 in the personal context, and
00:06:18 as I have told you before, it is related
00:06:20 to a bad organization, if I am going to give
00:06:24 a very  Of course, so you can see
00:06:26 it well, Arena meets her friends at
00:06:29 5 to go to the movies.
00:06:32 Lorena at four, thinks, Lorena, you have
00:06:37 to get ready, you have to shower,
00:06:40 dress, put on makeup, but Lorena thinks,
00:06:46 the weather is fine, you can still
00:06:49 watch a little TV, you can  rest a
00:06:52 little more in five minutes you start to get
00:06:56 ready lorena at a quarter past four
00:07:01 I have to prepare my urine
00:07:05 she showers dresses and puts on her makeup lorena
00:07:08 is ready to go out at 4:40 but lorena
00:07:16 has an appointment at  5 and Lorena does not
00:07:18 think about the unforeseen that is an
00:07:21 unforeseen that could be an unforeseen
00:07:23 an unforeseen is a situation an event
00:07:26 an event that Lorena does not have  In
00:07:29 her head, she doesn't think that something can
00:07:33 happen, it can happen on her
00:07:36 way, okay, for example, the subway
00:07:41 Lorena doesn't think that the subway can
00:07:44 be late,
00:07:46 so finally, Lorena is late
00:07:48 and she's late,
00:07:51 and also her friends call her, Lorena, you're
00:07:54 a  person well first topic that if
00:07:59 we do not know or do not really think about
00:08:03 him when having a relationship with a
00:08:07 Spanish or a Hispanic person of Hispanic culture
00:08:12 we can think he
00:08:16 has arrived half an hour late he did not want to
00:08:19 see me I am not important to him or
00:08:21 her not of  Don't take it that way,
00:08:25 we're chaotic and we have a very
00:08:28 bad organization, but the problem is
00:08:30 n't you, it's okay, cliché number
00:08:36 2,
00:08:39 we Spaniards are some stumps or some
00:08:42 halls, okay,
00:08:47 surely you've heard, sorry,
00:08:50 surely you've heard on more than
00:08:53 one occasion with my goodness  It's that the
00:08:55 Spanish speak very close and they also
00:09:00 touch each other a lot. They really like
00:09:03 physical contact when they talk and
00:09:05 I get  or I get very nervous and
00:09:09 I don't like it I don't like it I need my
00:09:12 personal space
00:09:15 well
00:09:17 this personal space
00:09:19 or also known as intercultural space
00:09:25 is nothing more than a cultural idea typical
00:09:29 of our
00:09:32 culture according to the Spanish we are snobs and
00:09:35 we are stumps because
00:09:39 the most  It's common here
00:09:41 when it comes to relating to
00:09:44 people, mainly with friends,
00:09:47 family. Okay, I'm Spanish and I like
00:09:51 physical contact with my
00:09:53 friends and my family, but
00:09:57 so that we also understand that it's
00:10:00 something cultural on the one hand, but it's also
00:10:03 on the other.  side something personal okay
00:10:06 when I hypothetical situation
00:10:10 I meet a person for the first time
00:10:15 yes it is true that here in Spain we
00:10:17 greet each other and get to know each other and
00:10:19 introduce ourselves with two kisses okay
00:10:23 but yes it is true that it is okay I can
00:10:26 meet for the first  time to a person and
00:10:29 by social convention I can I can
00:10:33 give him
00:10:34 two kisses but physical contact
00:10:38 social convention
00:10:40 but Lorena personally  I like
00:10:45 physical contact with people close
00:10:48 to my family and friends but if an
00:10:52 unknown person the first day
00:10:56 after hello I'm Lorena
00:11:01 has too much physical contact with me
00:11:07 let's say she wants to have it I don't
00:11:12 like it I feel uncomfortable
00:11:16 I want my  personal space I get
00:11:19 nervous I agree so we have
00:11:23 to take into account that being a stump or
00:11:27 sabon
00:11:29 is mainly
00:11:32 a social convention something culturally
00:11:35 established something that is part of the
00:11:37 way of thinking of the ideas of the
00:11:40 construction of our heads and that
00:11:43 is established  for our culture it is
00:11:46 worth and it also depends on the way
00:11:50 of being of each one
00:11:51 obviously there are very close Spaniards
00:11:55 both by culture and by way of
00:12:00 being agree on preferences things
00:12:03 that person likes to be close
00:12:07 agree
00:12:08 and mainly the most important idea
00:12:12 and what we have to stay with
00:12:15 after listening to me
00:12:18 talk for a long time is the idea that
00:12:22 even  To avoid cultural misunderstandings, the main thing
00:12:29 is
00:12:31 first to
00:12:33 go with an open mind, in agreement,
00:12:37 second, to think
00:12:40 that what I know about my culture
00:12:45 is not exclusive and normal, in
00:12:49 agreement, and third, to want to understand, to
00:12:53 want to understand and learn, I think that
00:12:57 if we go with these three ideas
00:13:00 a little in mind when we learn
00:13:04 a new language when we travel to another
00:13:06 country when we interact with other
00:13:08 people from different cultures
00:13:11 we have guaranteed success in the
00:13:14 sense that there will be communication
00:13:18 and we will avoid an uncomfortable situation
00:13:21 such as a misunderstanding
00:13:24 cultural, okay, so good, recapitulating, and
00:13:28 to close,
00:13:30 being a dart being a flavor or a touch
00:13:35 is basically determined by where
00:13:38 we are born, for our culture, for our
00:13:41 country, it's not something bad, it's okay,
00:13:46 and it also depends a lot on the person and
00:13:50 the way they are.  of each person, well,
00:13:54 well, so far, I agree, I
00:13:59 hope I didn't, I hope I didn't bore you too much,
00:14:02 and I hope that  May you at least remember
00:14:05 these three main ideas if at any
00:14:09 time you travel and interact with
00:14:11 people from other cultures accordingly
00:14:14 until next time

213,"00:00:00 In this video I am going to talk to you about the
00:00:03 things that I would prohibit or the things
00:00:08 that I would make mandatory if I governed
00:00:13 Spain
00:00:16 [Music]
00:00:19 Hello,
00:00:21 we are going to talk about the things that I would
00:00:26 prohibit if I governed Spain if I
00:00:31 were President of Spain or if I  If I were
00:00:34 a dictator in Spain, if the first thing I
00:00:40 would forbid would be
00:00:42 drinking beer straight from the can,
00:00:48 I think it's a really horrible custom to
00:00:51 drink beer straight from
00:00:56 the can. I
00:00:58 really don't understand why
00:01:01 some people don't use a good glass.
00:01:10 beer from the can because you
00:01:14 don't have glasses but some people
00:01:17 when they are at home drink
00:01:21 canned beer directly from the
00:01:24 fridge
00:01:26 it seems very bad to me I am
00:01:29 totally opposed to this practice and if I were
00:01:33 president if I would govern Spain that
00:01:37 would be totally prohibited  Beer
00:01:41 would always have to be drunk in a glass. Another
00:01:44 thing that I would strictly forbid if
00:01:49 I were President of Spain would be
00:01:53 advertisements.  You guys from YouTube that you can't
00:01:56 skip those ads that you have to watch
00:02:00 all the way to the end to be able to see the
00:02:04 video is really a drag and sometimes I
00:02:10 don't watch those videos if I have to watch the
00:02:14 entire ad I change the video because
00:02:18 I don't want to see everything  I can only see the ad for a
00:02:21 few seconds and if I want to
00:02:26 finish watching the ad I will
00:02:27 finish watching it but if I am not
00:02:30 interested in the ad or the product then I
00:02:34 will skip the ad so those ads
00:02:38 that are a bit heavy are a bit of a
00:02:41 nuisance because I would ban them if I  If I were
00:02:45 president of Spain, I would
00:02:48 ban YouTube ads that
00:02:51 cannot be skipped. Another thing that I
00:02:54 would prohibit would be transparencies
00:02:58 in hair. Transparencies were
00:03:02 very fashionable before, but I think that now
00:03:05 they are not so fashionable anymore.
00:03:07 Basically, transparencies are
00:03:11 light highlights that are  they put dark hair in their
00:03:14 hair and it
00:03:18 doesn't look lighter, it doesn't look blonder, it
00:03:23 just looks a bit weird,
00:03:27 I think it's a technique  only to
00:03:30 change the hair to lighten the hair that
00:03:33 doesn't work it
00:03:35 's a very very artificial hair a very artificial look
00:03:38 and I don't like it at all
00:03:42 so if I were president of Spain I would
00:03:45 ban
00:03:48 transparencies in the hair another thing that
00:03:51 I don't like at all and that  I would ban if I
00:03:54 were president it's
00:03:59 loudspeaker calls when you're in public those
00:04:03 people who put their phone on speakerphone in
00:04:07 hands-free when they're in public and
00:04:10 everyone can hear the
00:04:14 person they're talking to on the phone it's
00:04:17 quite annoying to hear a
00:04:22 someone else's phone conversation but when
00:04:24 you also have to listen to the person on
00:04:27 the other end of the phone it
00:04:31 's even worse I don't like it at all so
00:04:34 if I were to govern Spain that would end
00:04:39 that would be prohibited if you have to
00:04:42 talk on the phone in public you can't
00:04:46 put on the loudspeaker another thing that I would
00:04:49 forbid if I were president would
00:04:53 be for men to go down the street in
00:04:56 tank tops no no no that's
00:05:00 not right l  men have to go down
00:05:03 the street with at least a
00:05:07 short-sleeved shirt but that look of a
00:05:11 tank top on the street doesn't look
00:05:15 good to me maybe at home it
00:05:19 's fine at home but on the street men
00:05:22 should wear a shirt
00:05:25 so if I were president that would
00:05:28 end men could not go down
00:05:32 the street wearing tank tops and
00:05:35 finally something that would be prohibited if I were
00:05:38 president it would be the middle seat
00:05:43 on planes you can only have a
00:05:46 window or aisle but the
00:05:51 middle seat seems very cruel to me  nobody wants to be
00:05:55 in a middle seat on a plane
00:05:58 so all planes would be modified
00:06:02 so that there was no middle seat
00:06:06 only the window and the aisle and
00:06:11 those are all the things that i would
00:06:14 forbid if i were president of spain
00:06:19 and what are the things that  I would make them
00:06:23 mandatory if I were president, because
00:06:27 the first thing that would be mandatory would be
00:06:31 sunny days,
00:06:34 every day would be mandatory
00:06:37 sunny days, no hab  estuary rainy days there
00:06:42 would be no cloudy days there would
00:06:44 only be sunny days if I were
00:06:48 president another very necessary thing in
00:06:51 spain which should be mandatory is to
00:06:55 be punctual if I were president being
00:07:00 punctual would be mandatory because when
00:07:03 we are late
00:07:05 we are wasting time for the
00:07:09 another person and wasting time is the
00:07:12 worst thing that can be done there is nothing worse
00:07:16 than time that can be wasted
00:07:19 time should never be wasted and that is why
00:07:22 if you waste another person's time
00:07:25 you should go directly to jail
00:07:29 so  when I am president being
00:07:32 late would be prohibited and being
00:07:35 punctual would be mandatory and finally
00:07:39 something that would be mandatory if I were
00:07:43 president if I govern Spain it would be
00:07:47 that all the waiters take a
00:07:50 course on how to make tea on how to
00:07:54 prepare tea because here in Spain the
00:07:58 waiters  they don't know how to prepare a simple
00:08:02 cup of tea they put the water on one side
00:08:06 and the tea on the other or sometimes they leave the
00:08:10 tea bag inside the water c  When they add the
00:08:14 milk they don't know how to make a normal cup of
00:08:17 tea and how this is served is very
00:08:21 frustrating so if I were
00:08:24 president or if I governed Spain
00:08:27 all the waiters would have to take
00:08:30 a course to learn how to make a good
00:08:34 cup of tea and  that's all tell me in the
00:08:38 comments what laws would you make if I
00:08:42 ruled your country see
00:08:46 you soon
00:08:49 ah

00:03:00 egg and you beat it not in a bowl
00:03:06 a fork maybe beat it exactly and
00:03:10 then in the pan
00:03:13 you make an omelette exactly
00:03:16 many times I do this an omelette a
00:03:21 sometimes sometimes he froze things, for example,
00:03:25 burritos with ice, okay so this is the
00:03:29 fridge and the fridge that plugs in and it's
00:03:34 cold in the fridge and in the freezer
00:03:37 there are things that print frozen things
00:03:40 and in the freezer you put burritos rites

00:00:15 Hello everyone How are you I hope you
00:00:19 are all very well and in this video
00:00:23 I am going to talk to you about the things I
00:00:28 learned about the United States watching
00:00:32 Hollywood movies
00:00:34 Well  Yes, like all over the world, in Spain
00:00:39 we watch a lot of American movies and
00:00:43 I use the term American as something
00:00:47 from the United States because
00:00:52 I don't really like using the term
00:00:55 American, it seems a bit
00:00:58 artificial to me. So in this video I'm going to
00:01:03 use the term American to refer to myself.
00:01:06 To the things that come from the United States,
00:01:11 more specifically, I am going to talk about
00:01:15 American movies and the things that
00:01:18 I learned watching these movies when I
00:01:22 was a child or a teenager. I went to the
00:01:27 United States for the first time when I
00:01:30 was 15 years old and before that.  The
00:01:36 main reference that I had from the
00:01:39 United States were movies
00:01:43 , television series,
00:01:45 music videos in general,
00:01:49 popular culture.  And in the Hollywood series and
00:01:54 movies that we used to watch here
00:01:57 in Spain when I was little, there were
00:02:01 many things that were
00:02:06 a bit strange for Spaniards because in Spain they are not
00:02:10 like that and everyone in Spain
00:02:15 will surely agree with me on
00:02:19 these things.  that I am going to list that I
00:02:22 am going to name here today are things that
00:02:25 all of us Spaniards thought that is a
00:02:30 bit strange that is typically American
00:02:34 because in Spain we do not have that anyway
00:02:38 when I was little or when
00:02:41 I was a teenager I watched a lot of
00:02:45 movies
00:02:46 adolescent movies of boys and girls
00:02:50 who went to high school, which is secondary school,
00:02:53 and well, in these adolescent films,
00:02:58 in these films that
00:03:01 tell stories about boys and girls
00:03:04 who go to school, there were things that were
00:03:09 repeated in many films and that
00:03:13 for Spaniards were  Typically
00:03:16 American The first thing that
00:03:20 strikes us Spaniards, which we
00:03:23 Spaniards consider something strange and
00:03:27 typically American, is the des
00:03:31 very abundant fasts there are some with
00:03:36 scrambled eggs with bacon with pancakes with
00:03:41 syrup all of this is totally strange
00:03:46 for someone in Spain we Spaniards
00:03:49 have coffee for breakfast on
00:03:52 toast but we almost never eat eggs
00:03:56 and almost never eat pancakes I tried
00:04:00 art syrup for the first time when
00:04:04 I went to the United States, I had never tried
00:04:08 the syrup before that. Also, another thing
00:04:12 that stands out is that in the
00:04:15 mornings when the kids get up
00:04:18 to go to school, it is very light outside,
00:04:22 there is a lot of sunlight, as if it were
00:04:26 noon in Spain.  when we
00:04:30 get up to go to school it's still
00:04:34 dark outside most of my life
00:04:37 i've gotten up to go to school
00:04:41 when the sun isn't up yet and it
00:04:45 's all dark and you have to turn on
00:04:49 all the lights in the house so it
00:04:52 seems  that in America they get up at
00:04:56 11 in the morning to go to school
00:04:59 another thing that attracts attention and that in
00:05:03 Spain we do not have is a boy a boy
00:05:07 who rides a bicycle  eta
00:05:09 distributing newspapers to the houses that
00:05:14 is something very very American for
00:05:18 us Spaniards because in Spain there is
00:05:21 nothing like it there have never been children
00:05:25 distributing newspapers to the houses
00:05:28 here in Spain it is normal in some
00:05:32 small towns
00:05:34 for the bakeries the bakers distribute
00:05:38 the bread for  the houses but it is not normal
00:05:43 for there to be children delivering newspapers and it
00:05:48 never has been another thing
00:05:51 that strikes us Spaniards
00:05:54 in American movies is that
00:05:59 teenagers drive to school by car
00:06:03 They have their own car
00:06:06 and go to school  to your school by car
00:06:11 in Spain the minimum age to drive
00:06:16 to get your driver's license
00:06:19 is 18 years old you must be 18 years old to
00:06:25 get your driver's license the driver
00:06:29 's license and to be able to drive
00:06:32 a car
00:06:34 at 18 years old you cannot  Driving is
00:06:40 totally prohibited. Another thing that
00:06:43 is very American for Spaniards is
00:06:48 having lockers in schools in
00:06:53 Spain.  There are schools with lockers
00:06:56 that I know of. I think it's not normal to
00:06:59 have lockers in schools in
00:07:03 Spain. We all took a backpack to the institute
00:07:07 with all the books for the day. It
00:07:11 was a very, very heavy backpack and you
00:07:15 had no option of leaving your
00:07:19 books in  a locker or in a place
00:07:23 to avoid having to take them with
00:07:26 you, you had to carry your books with you in
00:07:30 your backpack all day long, it was a
00:07:33 very large and very heavy backpack, and in
00:07:37 Spanish institutes, in secondary schools
00:07:40 or even in
00:07:43 primary schools, this does not exist  concept of
00:07:47 popular boys no there are no popular boys and
00:07:51 girls when i went to
00:07:55 school i never heard another person say either
00:08:00 that girl is very popular or that boy is
00:08:03 very popular we don't have that concept there are
00:08:08 boys who have more friends and boys
00:08:10 who have  fewer fewer friends who are a
00:08:14 bit more shy and only have a couple of
00:08:18 friends
00:08:19 but there's not that idea of ​​a
00:08:23 popular person a popular girl that
00:08:27 everyone loves that  It doesn't exist in
00:08:31 Spanish schools, it's something very typical of
00:08:35 American movies. Another thing that
00:08:38 we Spaniards see in American movies
00:08:42 but that we
00:08:46 don't really have here in Spain is
00:08:51 end-of-year
00:08:56 dances.  end of
00:09:00 year but we don't have a dance where the
00:09:05 girls wear a very long dress and
00:09:08 put a flower on their wrist and a
00:09:12 limousine comes and a boy has to ask them
00:09:16 to go to the dance with him that doesn't exist
00:09:21 in Spain and there is no  dance with a king and
00:09:26 a queen punch all those things we
00:09:31 see in American films do not
00:09:35 exist do not exist in Spain another thing
00:09:38 that strikes us that
00:09:42 is very surprising to us Spaniards
00:09:46 about American films is that there
00:09:52 are no bars in  the houses have no bars on
00:09:56 the windows theoretically the United States
00:09:59 is the place where all
00:10:03 the murderers live however the houses do not
00:10:07 have much security they do not have bars
00:10:11 on the windows  so many times there is no
00:10:15 fence surrounding the garden Anyone
00:10:19 could enter the house in fact something
00:10:23 that catches my attention from
00:10:27 American movies and series is that it
00:10:30 seems that people can enter the
00:10:34 house from outside without having a key someone
00:10:38 can come and  open the door from the
00:10:41 street and enter the house without having a key
00:10:44 that is very strange and it is also very
00:10:48 strange how some houses have a
00:10:52 double door they have a normal door and
00:10:56 then on the outside they have another door
00:11:00 that is normally a metal mesh and
00:11:04 you have  You have to open both doors
00:11:08 to get in or out It is really
00:11:11 strange in Spain I have never seen a
00:11:15 house with a double door Another thing that
00:11:18 for many Spaniards has been something very
00:11:23 intriguing is the issue of
00:11:26 marshmallows or sponges or
00:11:30 clouds when they go camping  In
00:11:35 many American movies we see
00:11:37 that children go to the countryside, they go
00:11:40 camping and they make a fire, a bonfire, and
00:11:45 with some sticks they make
00:11:50 some c  White bears that for the
00:11:54 Spanish were something
00:11:56 unrecognizable, we did not know, we did not know what
00:12:00 that was, and I think it was when I went
00:12:06 to America that I discovered that these
00:12:09 white things are called marshmallows and that they
00:12:12 are basically little sponges or clouds
00:12:17 that melt and are cooked in an oven.
00:12:23 a bonfire in a fire in Spain nobody
00:12:26 does that nobody makes the sponges in the
00:12:30 fire that is totally American
00:12:34 And finally something that catches my
00:12:37 attention in many
00:12:40 Hollywood movies is that there
00:12:44 are never Cloudy days there are never rainy days every day  days the
00:12:48 weather is good it is sunny it seems that it
00:12:52 never rains it is never cold it is always
00:12:57 good in the street and yes in Spain
00:13:02 unfortunately that does not happen we have
00:13:05 rainy days sunny days Cloudy days
00:13:09 and These are the things that surprised
00:13:13 me or were shocking or
00:13:18 intriguing American movies I
00:13:23 thought these things were typical American stuff
00:13:29 Tell me in the comments If you
00:13:32 're not American What  things attract your
00:13:36 attention from American movies And
00:13:39 if you are American tell me if these
00:13:43 things that I have named are really
00:13:46 typical of the United States see you soon and
00:13:51 don't forget to visit the

231,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about
00:00:03 product names like Coca-Cola or company names
00:00:07 like
00:00:11 Apple, etc., but
00:00:15 names that sound very bad in Spanish
00:00:22 [Music]
00:00:24 Hello, well, many times, let's see, it's
00:00:29 normal, but there are company
00:00:32 names.  of products that
00:00:36 are originally in another language, no, and when
00:00:40 we hear them, the Spanish sound like a
00:00:43 word in Spanish and sometimes they sound bad, they
00:00:47 sound pretty bad, yes, then I'm going to
00:00:51 start with one that's a bit
00:00:55 geeky because it's from the world of
00:00:57 technology  computer
00:01:00 computers no but lately I
00:01:03 use a lot for my work which is
00:01:06 mongodb mongodb is a database is
00:01:12 a service
00:01:13 a program where you put the data of
00:01:18 a web page of an application in
00:01:20 our case is the database we
00:01:23 use  the dreaming spanish website
00:01:26 is where all our videos are,
00:01:28 our users, what's up, what do I put?
00:01:43 bad, which is used as an insult in
00:01:47 Spain, it can be used
00:01:51 to refer to people with
00:01:54 mental disabilities, not to people
00:01:57 who have a delay in
00:02:00 developing their intellectual capacity and
00:02:03 when the word montgó or mongolian is used
00:02:07 or with these people it is  a very
00:02:09 strong insult and sometimes this word is used
00:02:12 also for people who are not
00:02:15 mentally disabled as
00:02:18 well as an insult
00:02:20 if it is a bad word and when we hear the
00:02:24 name mongodb it sounds a bit weird at
00:02:27 least at first until you get
00:02:30 used to it  and ok, it starts to sound
00:02:32 normal to you, the following is an interesting one, it
00:02:36 's a company called supports it, yes,
00:02:41 just by saying it, it already amuses me,
00:02:44 supports dot com is a company or well,
00:02:48 supports dotcom is the website of a
00:02:50 company that is  It calls 'la apoya la apoya it
00:02:53 seems that it is a company from the usa that
00:02:57 specializes in spray sprays for
00:03:01 insulation or insulation for houses
00:03:04 to put on walls and such that it is
00:03:07 applied co  n a spray no and if they are called the
00:03:10 [ __ ] in case you don't know it supports it is the
00:03:13 male sexual member
00:03:16 then axis the following are the
00:03:18 Japanese in Japan there are many there are many
00:03:23 of these words that sound bad in
00:03:25 Spanish
00:03:26 because the pronunciation of Japanese and the
00:03:28 Spanish it looks alike it looks a bit
00:03:31 so if we end up with enough
00:03:34 words then hi 22 which are
00:03:38 studio ghibli movies from mine from
00:03:43 aquino from hayao miyazaki who is a
00:03:44 director of japanese animated movies
00:03:46 and the first one is good the name
00:03:50 of the movie in  Spanish at least
00:03:52 the first name it had in Spain is
00:03:55 the castle in the sky but the name
00:03:59 I think is the name with which it was published
00:04:02 later with the one with which it was published in
00:04:04 Latin America and well the
00:04:07 direct translation of the title of the film in
00:04:10 Japanese  it is the [ __ ] and the castle in the
00:04:14 sky what happens in Spain well it sounds
00:04:19 very strong to say the [ __ ] no because [ __ ]
00:04:22 is a prostitute is yes
00:04:26 specifically because she is a [ __ ] is
00:04:28 feminine is  a woman who has
00:04:31 converted sex for money no then if the
00:04:35 first edition the first time it was
00:04:38 published in spain they changed the
00:04:40 name and instead of the [ __ ] they put
00:04:44 the period then let's see this is not the fault
00:04:48 of miles from here it is not the fault  of those who
00:04:50 made the film but the
00:04:52 film is based on a
00:04:55 previous story and in fact it is based on the
00:04:58 book of gulliver's travels' if you
00:05:01 know weaver I don't suppose you know
00:05:04 gulliver's travels that he went to an
00:05:07 island where they had well  very
00:05:10 small people went to another island where there were
00:05:13 giants people much bigger than
00:05:16 him no well gulliver also went to a
00:05:19 floating island there was a piece of
00:05:22 land floating in the sky and in this
00:05:25 film there is also land
00:05:27 floating in the sky and this
00:05:30 floating island is called la puta and that in
00:05:33 spain they first called it la punto
00:05:36 but later they did a second dubbing
00:05:39 and they called it by the original name la
00:05:41 puta and the edition and dubbing of mexico
00:05:45 s  It has always been the [ __ ] that
00:05:48 continues to be funny, it still sounds funny and
00:05:50 another movie from miles from here is tiki
00:05:54 and this is more specific to Spain from
00:05:57 what I have read it seems that it is not used
00:06:00 or not used everywhere in
00:06:02 Latin America in Spain  click and it
00:06:04 's having sex is having sex
00:06:09 then again in spain kiki's name was
00:06:11 changed and they called her nick and
00:06:14 because quique is the name of the
00:06:15 protagonist the protagonist is a
00:06:17 witch who creates a letter delivery service
00:06:21 parcel and such no and if the
00:06:25 girl is called quique but in the
00:06:28 Spanish version they changed her name
00:06:30 and called her nick and
00:06:33 but again the
00:06:35 Spanish-American version kept the
00:06:37 original name and called her kick and that's because
00:06:40 perhaps for them it doesn't have that
00:06:42 meaning no the following is k removes it
00:06:45 if it removes it is a company I guess it
00:06:49 is a small company because I did not
00:06:52 know it until I went to hiroshima and
00:06:56 in hiroshima walking down the street and I
00:06:58 turn sima in [ __ ]  on we continue in japan
00:07:01 ok when i went to giro sima walking
00:07:04 well walking down the street we saw a
00:07:06 building me and my friend my friend tony i
00:07:09 don't know if you remember that tony has been in
00:07:11 a video of the dreaming spanish well
00:07:14 we saw a building with the name of  the
00:07:16 company and the company was called poop
00:07:21 yes yes yes a little box well a little box is
00:07:25 a small poop it's not very funny
00:07:27 because kaka and it's funny poop is
00:07:30 even funnier because it's a poop
00:07:32 but tiny
00:07:34 and if it's a company that's in
00:07:37 hiroshima poop  It sounds like a Japanese surname
00:07:40 because it's here and it's there are 22
00:07:43 characters 2 kanji that appear a lot
00:07:47 in the surnames of
00:07:49 Japanese families so surely poop
00:07:52 would be the surname of the family or of the
00:07:55 person who created this company so
00:07:58 continuing with Japan this one I think
00:08:01 is very  known and it's a car it's the
00:08:05 mitsubishi pajero yes mitsubishi pajero
00:08:09 what a problem and with this well if you don't
00:08:11 know it the pajero is an SUV it's
00:08:15 an SUV u  n 4x4 I guess
00:08:18 well I don't know SUVs sometimes
00:08:21 have a 4x4 version and a version that is not
00:08:24 4x4 but an SUV that happens that
00:08:28 Pajero is at least in Spain- I
00:08:32 think also in some places in
00:08:34 Latin America but Pajero is a person
00:08:38 normally we would not use  The word in
00:08:41 Spain is said to be more of a wank but a
00:08:45 pillbox is a person who becomes
00:08:47 low and a straw is masturbating if it is
00:08:52 masturbating it is good, well,
00:08:54 masturbation if you do not know this
00:08:56 word well, if it is sexually stimulating
00:08:59 to yourself, no, then yes, a wank
00:09:03 He is a person who is made to hash
00:09:06 who makes a lot of casualties and if I normally
00:09:10 would not use the word pajero but
00:09:14 we also understand it the same when we saw that
00:09:16 word we associated it directly and for
00:09:19 us it has the same meaning and
00:09:22 again in Spain they changed his
00:09:24 name  In Spain they could not sell it
00:09:27 with that name, they realized and
00:09:31 called it Monteros, which Montero makes a
00:09:34 lot of sense for an off-road car.
00:09:36 Because with him, with an SUV, well,
00:09:38 you go to the mountains, you don't go up the mountain,
00:09:41 so Montero, I think it's good,
00:09:43 it suits him very well if the pajero is called,
00:09:46 because
00:09:47 I don't know if they would have sold it, maybe they would
00:09:49 have sold more cars, who knows,
00:09:52 who knows, just for  the joke for
00:09:56 laughing not because look we Spaniards
00:09:58 are like that but yes but they changed the
00:10:02 name and it seems that in Spanish America
00:10:05 also in shot and in Spanish America they
00:10:07 also called it montero so 6
00:10:11 continuing with Japanese that Japan gives a
00:10:13 lot
00:10:14 there is a soup nor a  soup that in Japan
00:10:18 is called pota and pota this I have
00:10:22 read that it is very specific to Spain and it
00:10:26 is even good it is also jargon that stands
00:10:29 out it uses we used when
00:10:33 we were teenagers but even these
00:10:36 words are changing a lot no but
00:10:38 well when I was a teenager and  I don't know,
00:10:41 I suppose that even now, voting is
00:10:44 vomiting, it's not taking out the food you have
00:10:48 in your stomach,
00:10:49 voting is vomiting, and the pota is vomiting, it
00:10:52 's what makes you go crazy  stomach and it's
00:10:55 very disgusting and it smells very bad well
00:10:58 that's pota then of course when they
00:11:03 call a soup pota since you do
00:11:05 n't feel like eating cloth you don't feel like
00:11:09 eating the soup because I don't like
00:11:12 pota and I would never eat pota then  Yes it
00:11:15 sounds very bad but yes this I think is
00:11:19 very specific to Spain I don't know I don't
00:11:21 even know if of all the regions of
00:11:24 Spain next to Colón Colón this
00:11:30 is not so much with Spanish maybe color
00:11:32 is also Japanese it is a snack it is a yes
00:11:35 a type of Japanese snack sounds a bit
00:11:38 like colom not in English the colon because it is
00:11:42 the last part of the intestine where
00:11:46 the poop accumulates before leaving the poop
00:11:48 from the ass in Spanish as it has two L's
00:11:52 because it would not be the colon it would go away read

00:12:23 Korean that are funny these are not they

00:00:05 hello alma
00:00:07 hello
00:00:09 lately you've been making a lot of
00:00:12 videos for dreaming spanish right
00:00:17 so the audience the students of
00:00:21 dreaming spanish have noticed and
00:00:24 have some questions not what does
00:00:26 alma ask how it's been so many videos I've
00:00:30 seen they had questions so I
00:00:33 asked  that people send us their
00:00:35 questions and today you are going to answer them,
00:00:40 you are going to answer them
00:00:42 yes
00:00:45 look the first question is how
00:00:49 you and Pablo met and what made you
00:00:51 decide to start making videos for
00:00:54 dream in spanish
00:00:56 because how we met is that we met
00:01:00 We met for three loaves of bread I discovered the
00:01:04 channel and I remember that I added you
00:01:10 I sent you an invitation through linkedin I don't know
00:01:14 if you remember them Pablo no I didn't
00:01:17 remember that from linkedin no well if
00:01:20 I followed the channel and I sent your
00:01:24 videos to my students
00:01:27 because I liked it a lot and then I saw you
00:01:32 on linkedin and I added you simply for
00:01:35 having that connection and you sent me a
00:01:38 message saying you are interested in making
00:01:41 videos for  ra atr and my plans and you sent me,
00:01:45 well, the guidelines on how to
00:01:48 make the videos and I told you I can
00:01:51 make some and
00:01:54 because at the beginning you did it by yourself
00:01:57 I don't remember if I made two or three
00:01:59 videos
00:02:01 I made three I made a video my first video
00:02:05 was the one of  my opel experience the
00:02:09 second video was one about granada and the
00:02:15 third was the one about lola flores i
00:02:17 made a video this video about the
00:02:19 flowers
00:02:20 and then much later you
00:02:26 contacted me again and asked me
00:02:30 if i wanted to make more videos and  I told
00:02:32 you yes yes so now we have
00:02:35 started collaborating to make videos together and
00:02:38 also you are also doing other
00:02:41 tasks to give and ming Spanish no
00:02:43 other jobs of course and I am also
00:02:47 making scripts I write scripts I am
00:02:52 reviewing the videos of other teachers
00:02:56 and  doing different tasks and not only
00:03:01 I don't just make videos I also do other
00:03:04 tasks and in the future maybe even more
00:03:08 things like this
00:03:10 possibly next question in the
00:03:14 time you've been a teacher  Now have you
00:03:17 had a student who has
00:03:20 reached a level of Spanish who has spoken
00:03:24 close to that of a native speaker,
00:03:27 not really, simply
00:03:30 because I believe that to reach that level
00:03:35 it takes time, it
00:03:38 takes years,
00:03:41 I have had students who have  started
00:03:44 with me from scratch most of my
00:03:47 students start with me with a
00:03:50 low level of Spanish normally I don't have
00:03:53 many advanced students yes then
00:03:57 people start with me with a very
00:04:00 very low level practically zero some
00:04:02 people start from scratch and yes I have
00:04:06 seen that in little  time in a year I have
00:04:09 had students who have improved a
00:04:13 lot, they have learned a lot and
00:04:16 they can speak again only
00:04:18 in Spanish that is if they can talk about
00:04:22 different topics they can understand
00:04:26 me a lot I only used Spanish
00:04:29 when I speak with them well I  I always try to
00:04:32 use Spanish in my classes
00:04:35 as much as possible, but if with this with
00:04:39 these students after a year,
00:04:42 I can already speak  lar of many things and they
00:04:44 can also tell me many very well
00:04:48 next question what do you think
00:04:51 of language education methods in
00:04:54 Spanish schools well this could
00:04:57 include schools or academies not
00:04:59 language academies what do you think well
00:05:03 I think they generally follow
00:05:06 methods  Traditional
00:05:08 is not, I cannot say it one hundred percent
00:05:11 sure because I do not have much experience
00:05:14 in that, but for example,
00:05:17 I worked in an English academy and they
00:05:20 used a very traditional method with
00:05:24 their vocabulary lists, their exams,
00:05:28 the gap with which you set
00:05:34 exactly  exactly that and so
00:05:38 if I think that in general they are
00:05:41 very traditional methods both in
00:05:43 academies and in schools and
00:05:46 institutes and if I think that they are not the ones
00:05:50 that work best obviously that is why
00:05:54 in Spain children do not learn many
00:05:57 languages ​​at school I think  that now
00:06:01 because with social networks children
00:06:04 are much more connected with other
00:06:07 cultures they learn more but not  or they learn
00:06:11 because they want to learn English, for
00:06:13 example, but they learn because they
00:06:16 like to be on tick tock or I don't know how to
00:06:20 be on instagram and they learn they learn
00:06:23 simply by, let's say, exposure and
00:06:25 because of the interest they have yes yes I
00:06:29 also try to keep track of
00:06:32 teachers and schools  that use
00:06:35 comprehensible input and in Spain'
00:06:39 what has begun to exist in
00:06:43 recent years are schools
00:06:46 that use English as the curricular language,
00:06:49 not
00:06:52 if they use it to teach other
00:06:54 subjects, perhaps they teach mathematics in
00:06:57 English or some other subject if the
00:07:00 problem with this  I think it's that the
00:07:05 teachers who teach math in
00:07:08 English or science in English normally
00:07:11 don't have such a high level of English anymore, but
00:07:15 they don't speak English very well.
00:07:17 That's always a problem in
00:07:19 schools, of course,
00:07:22 in Andalusia, for example here in the south
00:07:25 of  Spain I think that to be in a
00:07:28 bilingual school they call it a
00:07:30 bilingual school, a school where
00:07:32 some subjects are taught  rten in
00:07:34 english the teacher needs
00:07:38 a b2 level it seems to me that a b2 level
00:07:41 is not a very high level to
00:07:44 model the language for children
00:07:48 yes yes you are going to be your input is based
00:07:53 on a person who speaks at b2 level
00:07:56 Well, maybe the best level that you will be
00:07:59 able to reach will be even
00:08:02 below that. Not sure.
00:08:04 Good. Next question, what
00:08:08 do you like the most about teaching Spanish?
00:08:13 Well, I like to help people
00:08:18 to develop this tool
00:08:21 that is  the language to be able to do what
00:08:24 they want to be able to travel or to be
00:08:27 able to study
00:08:29 is to help them to
00:08:30 improve their life or to achieve their
00:08:33 objectives
00:08:34 really if I think that I am
00:08:38 helping
00:08:40 helping people to achieve something very
00:08:43 valuable it is not that I know what  I
00:08:45 'm not a teacher, you can't really
00:08:48 make the person learn, but I did
00:08:51 try to guide my students or my
00:08:54 students so that they develop
00:08:57 that
00:08:58 tool you like better in the day-to-day life
00:09:02 of the  direct interaction with the
00:09:05 students and such or more him after a year
00:09:09 maybe you've been with the person look
00:09:12 back and say oysters you've improved a lot
00:09:14 and you feel good because it's improved
00:09:18 yes I really like it I like to look back and
00:09:21 say wow when it started  I didn't know anything
00:09:24 about this, look how much he has learned,
00:09:26 that is very satisfying for
00:09:31 me, although I am aware that
00:09:34 the credit is not mine alone, that is, the
00:09:38 person does a lot of his or her part, but
00:09:41 if I try to help, I try to guide that
00:09:45 person and that person  Follow my advice
00:09:48 and in the end you will go far and learn a lot,
00:09:53 because I find that very, very gratifying.
00:09:57 I think that yes, you can do it, well, you
00:10:00 can attribute at least part
00:10:02 of the success, no, of course, a part, well, if
00:10:05 I want to think that a part  It is the
00:10:07 work that I have done very well.
00:10:09 Next question, soul, are you a
00:10:12 polyglot like Pablo?
00:10:24 I also like it before now
00:10:28 it seems to me a super beautiful language and
00:10:31 I understand it quite well
00:10:34 I don't know to what extent I could speak it
00:10:37 because I don't have classes normally not
00:10:42 practical I don't try I don't try to speak and
00:10:46 I'm not very constant either I have
00:10:49 more constant periods where I
00:10:51 developed a  habit and I listen to
00:10:53 French every day and then I quit
00:10:56 but I would like to be more constant but
00:11:00 no so I am not a polyglot like
00:11:03 you Pablo
00:11:05 look in the future when we do other
00:11:09 languages ​​and they will have dreaming
00:11:11 friends and other languages ​​then it will be
00:11:14 easier for you  and you can be a polyglot, of
00:11:17 course, it is
00:11:20 very good if there is an accent or
00:11:24 dialect of Spanish that is difficult for you to
00:11:27 understand,
00:11:29 that is, there is no accent that is difficult for me to
00:11:33 understand because it is not so much about the
00:11:36 accent as it is about the register, it depends on this,
00:11:39 we get used to it very quickly  no
00:11:43 and if I'm here this letter is worth a diner
00:11:45 with this sound you listen for a couple of
00:11:47 minutes and more or less you understand it
00:11:49 enough  well yes yes the accent is not
00:11:52 difficult what is difficult is when a person
00:11:54 speaks with a lot of jargon with many
00:11:58 localisms the words that the
00:12:01 expressions that are only used in that
00:12:04 region that maybe they can be a
00:12:07 little bit different and that is what
00:12:11 It means that maybe you don't understand one
00:12:14 hundred percent, but if she were to speak, there is a
00:12:17 person talking about a more or less
00:12:19 well-known topic with a language,
00:12:21 let's say, not very informal, because there is
00:12:25 no problem understanding any
00:12:27 accent, if I agree listening to
00:12:30 someone talk about  In a very colloquial way
00:12:32 with a lot of jargon I found that I
00:12:34 did not understand parts of a movie from
00:12:37 Mexico, for example, but also
00:12:40 some conversations of people from
00:12:42 other regions of Spain, of
00:12:44 course, yes, of course,
00:12:48 the colloquial language can be at
00:12:50 the level of the neighborhood or even  at the
00:12:53 level of the group of friends, of course, yes,
00:12:56 totally, very well, next question,
00:12:59 my soul, I would like to know what you like to
00:13:03 do in your free time,
00:13:05 well, in my t  Free time like
00:13:08 everyone else I look at a lot of screens I don't think
00:13:12 I think I was there all day like
00:13:15 instagram well it's so much now I decide
00:13:19 'tik tok' sometimes I watch 'tik
00:13:22 tok' videos yes because it's a kind of
00:13:24 good entertainment
00:13:28 you don't have  Nothing to think about if I'm very
00:13:33 jokes and funny things one after the
00:13:36 other but not something more
00:13:41 exact anymore but I think that at first when
00:13:44 I discovered 'tik tok' it was more
00:13:47 novel to me and I found everything very funny
00:13:49 now it's like it's more predictable for
00:13:52 me  but I like it well when I'm not
00:13:54 looking at the screen well I do like
00:13:56 to go out on excursions for example
00:14:00 sometimes well before the pandemic when I
00:14:03 was in my town we did a lot of
00:14:06 excursions
00:14:08 to other towns in Granada and we went out to
00:14:11 eat well my family and I
00:14:14 go out  you go for a walk in the countryside you go to
00:14:17 an inn that is a restaurant in a
00:14:22 good town it is a different place I like that a
00:14:25 lot
00:14:28 also sometimes if you can take a walk
00:14:31 in the mountains if you have up  to the
00:14:35 diabetic sierra
00:14:36 the sierra nevada is
00:14:39 closer and sierra
00:14:43 nevada is in granada
00:14:47 yes yes yes many people may
00:14:50 expect that there will be snow in the south of
00:14:52 spain but if there is a lot of snow a
00:14:56 ski resort people go skiing
00:14:58 and in fact in granada  There is the highest
00:15:01 peak in the Iberian Peninsula, the Mulhacén,
00:15:04 if it is not more than 3400 meters or
00:15:09 something like that, and if then you can go up the
00:15:13 mountain, but when I go to the mountains,
00:15:15 I don't go to the high mountains, we go down the
00:15:17 mountains,
00:15:19 but  which is also very beautiful with
00:15:22 many views there are goats and everything is very
00:15:26 beautiful I like that very well next
00:15:30 question what is your favorite memory as a
00:15:34 child well I have already talked about this other
00:15:37 times but my favorite memories are
00:15:42 summers summers in the town of  my grandparents
00:15:45 because I didn't grow up in Granada' I grew up
00:15:47 in another city in another province and
00:15:51 when it was summer we would come to
00:15:54 my grandparents' town with my family and my
00:15:59 sister and I were always together
00:16:02 because we did what we  What we wanted because it
00:16:05 was a very small town, not very safe
00:16:07 and so we had a lot of freedom,
00:16:10 the bikes are everywhere,
00:16:16 no, we didn't have so many bikes and we have bikes but we didn't
00:16:19 get around by bike, it's because my grandparents
00:16:21 had an
00:16:23 orchard, a plot of land  Quite
00:16:26 large with several houses of my
00:16:29 aunts lived there and so in that one in
00:16:33 that orchard well there was the pool
00:16:35 and well outside and we played we went from one
00:16:38 house to another only on that land they already
00:16:41 had enough adventures
00:16:45 yes but we also went at night for
00:16:47 For example, the town square would be filled
00:16:50 with children because at night, because at
00:16:52 night it wasn't so hot and then
00:16:54 all the children would go to the square and
00:16:56 we would play until 12 at night,
00:16:58 all the children there playing
00:17:01 cards or Thursday, well, I  especially in
00:17:04 summer no the children stay
00:17:06 up very late yes yes yes this is normal
00:17:09 peas later they get up he gets up very
00:17:12 late too and is that that rhythm very
00:17:15 different and very bi  In the next question,
00:17:18 what is your favorite country apart from
00:17:21 Spain, because I haven't seen
00:17:25 so many countries either. You have lived in the US and the
00:17:29 United Kingdom, not well, I would say living
00:17:32 in the United States. I have spent a couple of
00:17:35 months
00:17:36 so, well, I would say that it is a
00:17:39 stay.  but I have not lived either
00:17:43 and I have lived in the United Kingdom
00:17:46 and I really like the United Kingdom
00:17:48 it seems to me a good country to live and yes
00:17:51 I really like the culture but the river is
00:17:55 more than Hungary if simply because
00:18:00 of the language when you can communicate well
00:18:03 you  you feel more integrated and in
00:18:06 hungary yes i was in hungary for a month well
00:18:09 everything was more complicated for me in
00:18:14 the supermarket i didn't understand the
00:18:16 labels and in case you don't know alma
00:18:19 has just returned from hungary now
00:18:22 yes of course without speaking the language well you
00:18:25 can't say  really that you have had
00:18:27 to know the country well not of course of course
00:18:31 exactly then it is how to do
00:18:33 tourism I have been to many countries yes
00:18:35 but simply visiting them I have
00:18:39 visited no I can't  say that I have
00:18:42 integrated a lot into the culture and nothing
00:18:44 when you are a tourist because you
00:18:47 eat food from places but that's it and what country
00:18:51 like this having visited it as a tourist
00:18:54 only
00:18:55 although the country caught your attention and you would
00:18:58 tell me oysters I would like even if it was to
00:19:00 try living  I don't know to live here because I
00:19:06 don't know and this would have to be that
00:19:10 unexpected question I would have to think about it
00:19:12 carefully I know that for example as a
00:19:15 tourist experience I really liked
00:19:17 Croatia but because I went in summer
00:19:20 and I was sailing and I remind you that
00:19:23 the landscapes well I was sailing for a
00:19:26 week on a sailboat and then we were
00:19:29 in the natural parks with
00:19:33 waterfalls and all that and I found it
00:19:36 impressive yes yes I found it very very
00:19:40 beautiful I found nature
00:19:42 very impressive but I don't know if I
00:19:44 would live in a place like  croatia yes no i
00:19:48 don't know i was also in mexico and i
00:19:51 liked it but i don't know if i would live in a
00:19:54 place like mexico in the long term
00:19:59 next question well more than  a
00:20:01 question is a request I love your
00:20:05 city' granada and it would be wonderful if
00:20:07 you could put more content about
00:20:09 granada
00:20:12 if we've already been talking about it
00:20:15 right pablo yes we are already planning it
00:20:17 no yes yes I'm going to start trying to make a
00:20:23 video it's in the street  and showing a
00:20:26 monument is showing different parts
00:20:29 because the food also shows a little bit of
00:20:33 the city which I think is very
00:20:35 interesting but I have to learn to
00:20:38 make videos on the street which is a
00:20:40 process I don't think it's that easy of
00:20:43 course if it requires a bit of  practice
00:20:45 holding the camera so that it doesn't move much
00:20:50 to record good sound and such yes but well
00:20:53 let's try it to see how it becomes
00:20:55 clear to us next question do you like living
00:20:58 in córdoba
00:21:02 I like living in córdoba very well
00:21:06 unfortunately I have never lived in
00:21:08 córdoba but I have  I've been to Córdoba and it
00:21:12 seems like a very beautiful city.
00:21:14 Córdoba is a city that is close to
00:21:16 Granada, it is not very far, it is further
00:21:19 inland and it is very similar to Granada
00:21:23 in many aspects.  cough has a lot of history
00:21:26 being the difference in how
00:21:29 people speak from Granada to Córdoba well if I
00:21:32 know if it ends it has a very
00:21:35 distinctive accent yes it does have a very
00:21:38 distinctive accent and let's see I think you have
00:21:41 to be very familiar with
00:21:44 Andalusian accents  to sap to notice
00:21:47 that difference but an Andalusian yes that
00:21:50 is not totally the difference well
00:21:54 I suppose that really this person
00:21:56 wanted to ask if you like living in
00:21:57 Granada of course then ask which is your
00:22:01 which is the most interesting place in the
00:22:03 city
00:22:04 because there is  a lot, in fact, yesterday
00:22:08 I was making a list of places
00:22:11 to be able to make videos there and I
00:22:14 realized how much the site was worth and
00:22:17 for example, I really like
00:22:20 Carmen de los Mártires, which is a
00:22:24 nice house with a garden  very big
00:22:28 and a carmen is a house it is like a house
00:22:31 that has an orchard it is a type of house
00:22:33 that exists in granada yes that is a
00:22:36 carmen and the origin of the name carmen and
00:22:38 all that I don't know  Yes, that is the
00:22:41 origin of the name Carmen, but well,
00:22:44 I imagine that it has an Arab origin,
00:22:47 but if it is a house, it is a house with an
00:22:50 orchard and it is very beautiful,
00:22:52 obviously there is the Alhambra,
00:22:55 thank you very much, languages ​​that are most
00:22:58 famous for tourists, of course.  yes but in
00:23:01 addition to simon very
00:23:04 old exteriors also very beautiful
00:23:07 yes a lot a lot to see here and you like to
00:23:11 live there for the day to day of your life
00:23:13 and such
00:23:15 and yes I think it is a city where you
00:23:18 can move very easily because it is
00:23:21 small it is  a relatively
00:23:23 small city and it's cheap it's not a very expensive city
00:23:29 if I think it's the opposite of
00:23:31 london not
00:23:33 exactly the opposite it's much quieter
00:23:38 if it's very touristy but it's a good
00:23:43 city to live I think you can have a
00:23:46 good quality of life very  well there
00:23:49 we come to the last question this
00:23:52 person tells us that the video you
00:23:54 made in which you told the story
00:23:57 when you visit your grandmother's house
00:24:00 how good it was without you
00:24:04 seeing her  ie for quite some time
00:24:06 that glass seemed interesting to him, yes, the
00:24:09 video you recorded and you ask if your
00:24:13 grandmother told you things about when she was
00:24:16 young and what life was like in those days of
00:24:22 course of course my grandmother told me many
00:24:26 things about her life when she was already
00:24:29 Well, obviously, it was a
00:24:32 very hard life because
00:24:34 our grandparents lived through the war,
00:24:37 the postwar, yes, the civil war,
00:24:42 but she told things about her life,
00:24:45 for example,
00:24:47 I remember that once she told me that she already
00:24:51 lived in the town where she also lived and
00:24:54 was  motherless all her life she was
00:24:56 motherless ours and never
00:25:00 was never went to school never
00:25:03 learned to write or read or when she was
00:25:06 older older
00:25:09 I tried to teach them and to try is
00:25:12 negligible but she was already very
00:25:14 old but but yes  For example, she told me
00:25:17 once that
00:25:19 a man went through the villages making
00:25:22 holes in the girls' ears
00:25:24 to put on the earrings and of course
00:25:30 she wanted the holes to be pierced.  eros but
00:25:32 she was so poor that she did not have
00:25:34 earrings to wear and so they
00:25:36 put two little wires on her, they did not make
00:25:38 the holes because she wanted to but she did
00:25:41 not have earrings and they put two
00:25:44 wire sticks on her
00:25:46 yes
00:25:48 yes yes then yes well today she told me
00:25:52 many things about  A very, very
00:25:55 poor life, not Spain at that time, it was, it was
00:25:58 a very poor country or there was a lot of government,
00:26:01 she dedicated herself to what
00:26:04 my grandmother does, my grandmother is that living in
00:26:08 a town, well, the women did the
00:26:10 housework and my grandfather, well, he
00:26:13 worked in  the field
00:26:15 was a totally rural life if you used
00:26:19 taking care a little that the chickens and
00:26:22 everything of course exactly everything well with
00:26:25 everything that the women could do by
00:26:27 physical force well everything well of course
00:26:29 they slaughtered once a year they killed a
00:26:31 pig no or whatever  outside, well, they did all that
00:26:35 between men and women, but everything
00:26:38 taking care of the children, all the
00:26:41 housework, and I'm sure I also worked
00:26:45 on everything that I could do
00:26:47 physically.  Well, it was a road with a lot of
00:26:50 work and a lot of work and little
00:26:54 money
00:26:55 looking here at the specks I saw that you were writing
00:26:58 something about a lining if my grandmother
00:27:00 when she was very old she did
00:27:06 not remember him she did not have, let's say, the
00:27:09 most recent memory  she was going away
00:27:12 but the one about very old things and she
00:27:15 remembered and then she told that when she was
00:27:18 alive well when she was young
00:27:20 they had chicken after when
00:27:23 the fox came the chickens the chickens
00:27:26 climbed the trees to the olive trees for
00:27:29 that  Yes, and so this is
00:27:32 very funny in the media to think that a chicken can
00:27:34 fly up to an olive tree so that the
00:27:37 fox won't eat them, well,
00:27:41 we do have the idea that
00:27:44 chickens don't fly, but I saw a video and
00:27:47 well, they do fly.  or maybe they fly a long
00:27:50 distance but and that they are capable of
00:27:53 flying a little no yes yes yes yes even
00:27:57 pablo peacocks can fly
00:28:02 if I have seen royal payments on top of a
00:28:04 tree and it has been very
00:28:06 impressive to me it is that it is a  such a
00:28:08 large peacock can fly its tail with
00:28:11 such a long tail and everything yes yes yes yes very
00:28:14 good well here the questions are over
00:28:17 thanks to the sea for answering us a
00:28:21 pleasure and well we will continue to see more
00:28:23 videos of soul in the future
00:28:26 very well come to  mar several days

236,"00:00:00 hello hello I'm clau and I'm very happy to
00:00:03 be with you again today I want to
00:00:06 talk about the 6 things that most
00:00:11 impacted me the first time I spent a
00:00:14 winter in montreal canada
00:00:18 [Music]
00:00:21 as many of you know canada is
00:00:25 a country characterized by  have
00:00:28 very cold winters, especially in the
00:00:32 province of Québec, where
00:00:36 the city of Montreal is located, a city that I have
00:00:40 visited during the summer and during the
00:00:44 winter, but I must confess that
00:00:47 winter is what has impacted me the most
00:00:50 since I come from the city of  mexico and
00:00:55 our winter is nothing like
00:00:59 a
00:01:00 montreal winter so i am going to tell you about the
00:01:05 6 things that surprised me the most number
00:01:10 1 the underground city montreal
00:01:14 has miles of
00:01:19 underground establishments you can go shopping and go to
00:01:23 the university go do paperwork in
00:01:26 government offices and everything without
00:01:30 going outside right
00:01:31 now shocking to walk
00:01:33 miles and miles without leaving the
00:01:37 city or knowing that the  I was at one point and
00:01:42 that if I walked seeing shops and
00:01:46 restaurants I
00:01:47 could reach another point within the
00:01:51 city.
00:01:52 That was one of the things that struck me the most,
00:01:55 how life changes from having
00:01:59 outdoor activities or events to
00:02:04 moving everything and doing it indoors.
00:02:07 closed spaces the second thing that
00:02:11 caught my attention was the clothing
00:02:14 when I arrived I had to buy a
00:02:19 special coat that will withstand
00:02:23 -0 temperatures I had never been
00:02:27 below 0 degrees or 5 degrees so it
00:02:33 was shocking for me to have to look for
00:02:37 a coat that  a jacket covers you completely
00:02:40 so a large jacket
00:02:43 that covers you
00:02:45 that allows not so much cold to enter
00:02:50 your body
00:02:52 I also had to buy a special pair of
00:02:55 boots to walk on the snow
00:02:59 I have very cold feet I am a
00:03:02 person that his feet his  feet in
00:03:05 a very cold part
00:03:06 so finding boots that would
00:03:11 work for me was a bit complicated
00:03:14 but being in canada it was very easy
00:03:18 because there during the rainy season  and
00:03:22 winter in all stores you can
00:03:25 find special boots for snow
00:03:29 another thing that is very important and that is
00:03:33 different from life in Mexico
00:03:37 that to enter any place you must
00:03:41 leave your clothes at the entrance for example
00:03:45 if you go to the gym
00:03:46 you must take off your  jacket take off your
00:03:51 jazz boots since they are full
00:03:53 of salt snow but this one is dirty so
00:03:58 you should leave them before entering and your
00:04:01 jacket too because it is so hot
00:04:04 that when you enter a closed space they
00:04:09 generally have heating and
00:04:12 you could die of heat other
00:04:15 accessories  What I had to buy when
00:04:19 I arrived in Montreal were gloves
00:04:21 where my fingers were not separated.
00:04:25 I knew the gloves in which your
00:04:30 fingers are separated and there are and each finger
00:04:34 is covered
00:04:36 independently but here in
00:04:39 Montreal they use gloves in which your
00:04:42 fingers are
00:04:43 together  so that you won't be so cold this way,
00:04:47 another of the things or
00:04:50 accessories that
00:04:53 I found
00:04:56 in Montreal were the  patches patches
00:05:00 to not feel so cold I already told you
00:05:05 that I am a person who has a lot
00:05:10 of feet
00:05:11 so finding these patches for me
00:05:14 was wonderful because you can put them
00:05:18 on the sole of your foot, that is not to
00:05:22 say where you step on in this part of the foot  foot
00:05:26 or, for example, there is also for the hands
00:05:30 and you can put them under your glove in
00:05:34 this way for a certain time,
00:05:37 which is generally a couple of hours, this
00:05:40 article or this accessory will emit
00:05:43 heat and you will be warm, your
00:05:47 extremities will remain  hot
00:05:51 the other thing the number 3 thing that
00:05:55 surprised me in montreal is that there is salt on
00:05:59 the streets without salt because it is possible that
00:06:04 with the snow you slip and fall there are
00:06:08 many falls during the winter in
00:06:11 montreal it happened to me it happened to me and i was grateful to
00:06:17 have  a jacket that covered up to
00:06:22 my legs because that way the
00:06:25 blow wasn't as hard and no no it didn't
00:06:29 hurt but I've heard
00:06:34 horror stories of people who have broken a
00:06:37 bone  That or they have fractured some part
00:06:41 of their body due to a fall in the
00:06:44 snow. Another thing that struck me
00:06:48 was the wind and the storms.
00:06:52 The wind is super super strong in
00:06:56 Montreal. The truth is that it is a wind
00:06:59 that is capable of moving you, no.  If you are
00:07:03 walking or you are standing on the street
00:07:06 this wind comes and hits very hard
00:07:10 so
00:07:12 you must be careful when walking due to the
00:07:16 force of the wind
00:07:18 I also had to be in a storm
00:07:24 it was not something very serious but I was in a
00:07:28 snow storm and  It was shocking how
00:07:31 my eyelashes
00:07:33 were covered in snow when my
00:07:37 mom saw me she said wow what happened to
00:07:41 you you have all your eyelashes covered in
00:07:44 snow it was shocking the last and
00:07:48 sixth thing that surprised me from being
00:07:53 in Montreal one winter is the amount of
00:07:56 sports that  there are in snow sports the
00:07:59 truth is that I believe that in canada it is
00:08:02 a country where many sports are practiced they
00:08:05 try to be active both in
00:08:09 the summer when they play
00:08:13 soccer or other
00:08:15 or other sports to the  outdoors but in
00:08:19 the winter they also have certain
00:08:22 sports for example hockey which is
00:08:26 one of the most important sports in
00:08:28 canada and which I recommend going to a
00:08:31 game because I had a lot of fun in
00:08:36 a hockey game I attended but you
00:08:39 also have the opportunity to  having
00:08:45 natural skating rinks in the little lakes or in
00:08:48 the springs that freeze during the
00:08:51 winter and they can skate there it's
00:08:54 amazing that many Canadians or
00:08:57 Quebecers have ice skates
00:09:01 to take advantage of what nature
00:09:04 gives them and skate and have a
00:09:08 fun time  During the winter,
00:09:12 other sports that are also known
00:09:14 are skiing. It is not often that they go
00:09:18 skiing and also snowboarding or snowboarding.
00:09:23 The truth is that I
00:09:27 really want to try this sport
00:09:32 to take advantage of winter in a different way.
00:09:35 In Mexico I skated not
00:09:39 frequently but I got to skate in
00:09:46 artificial ice skating rinks and I can say  that skating
00:09:50 on a natural track is a
00:09:52 totally different experience and for me incredible
00:09:56 I hope you liked these six
00:10:01 things that struck me and that were
00:10:04 different for me from spending a
00:10:07 winter

004,"00:00:00 In little more than three years, the President
00:00:04 of Mexico has given a lot to talk about
00:00:11 [Music]
00:00:14 Hello, I'm Michelle and today I want to
00:00:19 talk about the President of Mexico,
00:00:23 Andrés Manuel López Obrador, or as we
00:00:27 know him here, I'm speaking, I've been speaking for more
00:00:32 than three years.  more or less three and a
00:00:36 half years as president of Mexico and
00:00:40 during all this time he has given a
00:00:44 lot to talk about, he has caused many
00:00:47 controversies, that is why today I want us
00:00:51 to talk about the most
00:00:55 controversial moments of
00:00:58 one of the most
00:01:02 controversial moments where he gave the most  what to
00:01:06 speak
00:01:06 was when anv greeted the mother of
00:01:12 joaquín el chapo guzmán the president
00:01:17 spoke greetings to the
00:01:21 drug trafficker's mother during his visit to the
00:01:25 state of sinaloa a state that is in the
00:01:28 north of mexico when he greeted her he
00:01:34 told her i already received your letter
00:01:38 what i  He gave people and journalists to understand
00:01:43 that the president was
00:01:47 in contact with the
00:01:51 Guzmán family
00:01:59 in the spirit of the letter
00:02:01 and if he needed to receive your friendly cardboard  or
00:02:05 another moment of controversy was when he
00:02:10 spoke, he said that to end the
00:02:14 violence in mexico in his government there were going
00:02:18 to be more hugs,
00:02:22 not bullets with this the president was
00:02:26 trying to say that he wanted to eliminate
00:02:30 violence and not use weapons to
00:02:36 end it that rim did not know  They make fun
00:02:41 of the fact that I said
00:02:45 hugs, not bullets
00:02:49 and we are going to show that it works, but
00:02:53 although he did not want to use weapons,
00:02:58 all Mexicans were surprised when he
00:03:01 decided to create a new
00:03:06 military group called the National Guard,
00:03:12 despite the fact that this National Guard, these
00:03:15 soldiers are  All of Mexico,
00:03:21 unfortunately, violence in Mexico
00:03:25 increased and that is that so far in his
00:03:29 government, the number of deaths has been recorded,
00:03:34 which is
00:03:40 121,655 deaths. These deaths are divided into
00:03:46 those people who died with
00:03:49 violence by organized crime groups.
00:03:54 assaults robberies and also to those
00:03:58 women who died victims of
00:04:03 femicide femicide is a death that occurs
00:04:08 for reason  It is gendered, that is to say,
00:04:13 because they are women with this figure, with this
00:04:18 number, the government of Andrés Manuel
00:04:21 López Obrador already became the
00:04:25 most violent government in Mexico in the
00:04:30 2000s, but the controversies about giving people
00:04:35 something to talk about
00:04:37 continued because ANV gave it a
00:04:41 lot.  what to talk about when he told
00:04:45 people who commit crimes such as robberies and
00:04:49 assaults that they will think it over because
00:04:55 if they kept doing that
00:04:58 he was going to accuse them with their mom with their dad
00:05:03 and with their grandparents and of course that the
00:05:09 moms the dads and the  grandparents were not going to
00:05:15 be happy and they were going to scold them so
00:05:20 you better think about
00:05:22 it before acting badly in
00:05:25 mexico be careful because it is one
00:05:28 of
00:05:30 those I am going to accuse you
00:05:33 with your mothers
00:05:36 with your parents with your grandparents like
00:05:40 some countries in the world mexico  He had a
00:05:44 presidential plane, a plane that only the
00:05:48 president and his workers could
00:05:52 use to go from place to place
00:05:56 safely, but Amlo decided that it was no longer
00:06:03 going to be used in Mexico,
00:06:05 so he tried to see  Understand it but
00:06:11 no one wanted to buy it so he had a
00:06:15 new
00:06:18 idea I'm going to give it to a lucky Mexican man or woman they
00:06:23 just have to
00:06:27 participate in a raffle a raffle is a
00:06:31 random contest where you had to
00:06:35 buy a ticket and if they chose your
00:06:40 ticket  Once
00:06:42 these tickets were won, they cost more or less 500
00:06:47 pesos, something like 25 dollars when
00:06:53 all the tickets were sold
00:06:58 and other surprises
00:07:00 because in the end
00:07:03 no one won the plane and it was better to keep
00:07:09 the plane and no one uses it anymore with
00:07:14 so much poverty this is an insult it's a
00:07:19 plane  We are going to raffle it off on September 15
00:07:21 and what is obtained will be
00:07:24 used to buy medical equipment and
00:07:26 care for the people. Buy your little piece. Let's
00:07:29 make history for Anglo or Andrés Manuel
00:07:34 López Obrador.

200,"00:00:00 you understand Spanish well but you still
00:00:03 can't speak this question comes to my attention
00:00:06 so today I'm going to
00:00:10 explain why this happens and how to
00:00:14 start speaking if there is any trick if
00:00:17 something has to be done to go from understanding to
00:00:21 speaking
00:00:24 [Music  ]
00:00:27 hello, well, it's really very simple, it's very
00:00:33 simple, there may be two reasons
00:00:36 why you can't speak as well as you
00:00:41 would like or as you think you should be able to
00:00:44 speak, one is that you still haven't
00:00:48 acquired enough
00:00:52 enough vocabulary or enough
00:00:54 grammar and the second reason the second
00:00:57 reason is that you don't dare to be
00:01:00 afraid to speak so let's talk
00:01:03 first about the first reason that you haven't
00:01:06 acquired enough that your level in
00:01:09 the language is still not enough
00:01:12 then when you are learning a
00:01:15 language  it is a constant is that
00:01:19 you will always understand more than you know how to
00:01:22 say this always happens this is
00:01:25 inevitable this also happens with our
00:01:28 mother tongue it happens to me  With
00:01:30 Spanish,
00:01:32 if this happens, it is always unskillful and inevitable
00:01:35 because it would be the opposite. The
00:01:38 opposite would be to be able to say more words
00:01:41 than you understand, knowing how to use and
00:01:44 saying words that you don't understand, it
00:01:47 doesn't make sense for that to happen, and this
00:01:51 happens because every word every  word
00:01:54 that we learn and each aspect of the
00:01:57 grammar that we learn we may
00:01:59 have learned a little or we may
00:02:02 have learned more any word and
00:02:05 part of the grammar will follow
00:02:08 a learning curve no and to be
00:02:11 able to use it to be able to say that
00:02:14 word you have to  having passed a certain
00:02:17 threshold a line has to be
00:02:20 above this line for us to
00:02:22 know it well enough to
00:02:25 be able to use it but of course at any
00:02:28 time we are going to have words and
00:02:31 vocabularies above the line but
00:02:35 there will be others that are not  below
00:02:37 that we already understand them quite well but
00:02:41 that they still don't occur to us that we don't
00:02:44 think about them when we're
00:02:46 talking about it  Then there are always going to be
00:02:48 some words that are going to be
00:02:50 below and we are going to understand more
00:02:54 than we know how to say so all
00:02:57 the words go through this
00:03:02 learning curve and as a word improves
00:03:06 we learn it more and it goes up this curve is
00:03:08 with input is  With exposure to the language,
00:03:12 only with input,
00:03:15 this threshold will pass this line. We don't have to
00:03:19 do anything special to
00:03:22 activate the vocabulary or activate the
00:03:26 grammar, and I'm going to give you a
00:03:29 very clear example. There are words that I have heard in my
00:03:33 life, I have heard several.  times that I have never
00:03:36 said so in theory I have not
00:03:39 activated them but I am going to give you an example
00:03:43 richard nixon the island of tonga quasar
00:03:47 all these are words they can be
00:03:51 quasars a name a general noun
00:03:54 the other two are proper names they are
00:03:57 words that I have heard and  that right now
00:04:00 you have heard the first time in my life
00:04:04 that I say them never before in my life
00:04:06 had I said those words you have
00:04:09 seen me doubt or think to see how it was said
00:04:13 this is not  n already activated and I have never
00:04:18 had to activate them I have never practiced
00:04:20 saying them before saying them now for the
00:04:24 first time in my life so this
00:04:27 happens with vocabulary and it also happens
00:04:30 with grammar only that grammar
00:04:33 is even more exaggerated we can
00:04:37 understand a lot understand a lot of content
00:04:40 understand a lot of input without
00:04:44 knowing the grammar very well or without knowing
00:04:47 the grammar very well because in many cases
00:04:51 the words only the words of the
00:04:56 input we receive are enough for us
00:04:59 to understand more or less what they are
00:05:03 talking about and this happens a lot especially
00:05:07 if you are learning  Spanish but you already
00:05:10 speak Italian or French Portuguese a
00:05:14 very related language that has a lot of
00:05:17 vocabulary in common you will see that
00:05:19 only with the vocabulary
00:05:21 you already understand a lot and the grammar is going to
00:05:25 come later for a little behind and
00:05:29 you are really going to have to listen to
00:05:31 Spanish for hundreds of  hours
00:05:34 for the
00:05:37 grammar to improve and get closer to the level of the
00:05:41 vocabulary that  you have but to
00:05:43 acquire it I acquired it deiss and it is
00:05:46 acquired the same with inputs you do not need to
00:05:49 practice anything special to activate the
00:05:53 grammar so this was the first
00:05:55 reason because you are not good at speaking
00:05:59 because you have not acquired enough we
00:06:02 are not going to the second reason the second
00:06:05 reason  it is that perhaps you have already acquired
00:06:08 enough you have enough
00:06:10 vocabulary and grammar to
00:06:14 hold a day-to-day conversation
00:06:16 but you don't dare you're afraid you don't have
00:06:20 confidence in yourself and
00:06:23 well you don't dare to speak and this this
00:06:27 I think  is it a legitimate use of practicing
00:06:31 speaking is if it's okay to practice
00:06:34 speaking to realize not to get better
00:06:37 to speak better but to
00:06:40 realize that you already speak well and that you don't have
00:06:44 to be afraid then how can you
00:06:47 do this and make it easy to do  make
00:06:51 it easy for you to start talking well
00:06:54 the first thing is to talk in a situation
00:06:58 where you feel comfortable talking
00:07:01 to people you trust
00:07:03 people you know  They are not going to judge you
00:07:07 that they are not going to laugh at you with friends
00:07:10 with teachers looking for a
00:07:15 language exchange partner that you already know that
00:07:18 they are in the same situation as you
00:07:20 and in general someone with whom you
00:07:24 feel comfortable with whom you know  that you
00:07:27 don't have to cut yourself, you don't have to be
00:07:30 afraid, you can let
00:07:32 what you already know what you already
00:07:35 know about the language come out naturally, and when you start speaking
00:07:38 and you realize that the
00:07:40 words are coming out that you already speak
00:07:42 quite well, well, you're not going to  then be afraid
00:07:45 of speaking on the street to speak in
00:07:49 a situation with people perhaps you
00:07:51 still do not know and if by doing this
00:07:54 practice trying to speak with
00:07:56 someone you trust you realize that you
00:08:00 still do not speak well you still doubt a
00:08:03 lot you still have many things to do  words
00:08:07 then nothing happens continue with the input
00:08:10 because input is still needed you just
00:08:13 need to have a little patience and
00:08:16 when you receive more hours of input and
00:08:19 acquire more vocabulary and record more
00:08:21 Then grammar will be more and it will be
00:08:25 easier for you to speak without having to put yourself in and
00:08:29 make an effort and get frustrated by trying to
00:08:32 speak without still having all the
00:08:34 vocabulary that can even lead
00:08:37 to associating bad experiences with the
00:08:41 fact of trying to speak the language, no,
00:08:44 well, that's it.  This is the reason why
00:08:46 you still don't know how to speak or you haven't
00:08:49 acquired enough of the language or you don't
00:08:52 dare come on

00:00:08 if it is a king we don't have a king
00:00:13 we have a king and in this video I'm going to
00:00:18 explain if we Spaniards
00:00:21 like or don't like the king
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:31 hello well if we have a king Spain  it is
00:00:37 a monarchy but you know james bush
00:00:43 james bush is the brother of george bush
00:00:46 jr bush said spanish republic the
00:00:51 republic of spain but spain is not
00:00:54 a republic it is a king it is not a
00:00:57 monarchy
00:00:59 and monarchy means there is a king
00:01:03 and the king now  His name is Felipe
00:01:08 Sexto Felipe Felipe Sexto and Felipe Sexto has been
00:01:14 king for a very short time since 2014
00:01:21 very recently and Felipe Sexto is not very
00:01:27 old he is not young enough
00:01:31 but his father the father of Felipe Sexto
00:01:37 who was king before was king his father
00:01:41 he has not died
00:01:44 no he has not died yet the king in
00:01:49 2014 retired he retired if he retired
00:01:56 before the kings were kings until they
00:02:00 died for life they were king
00:02:05 but now the king can retire he can
00:02:09 give the crown to his son yes  now that's
00:02:14 hard  erent has changed and there are more things
00:02:18 there are more things that have changed for
00:02:22 example
00:02:23 the king has married a woman a
00:02:29 woman who is not royalty her parents
00:02:33 her father her mother are not kings no no no
00:02:40 now she is the queen no
00:02:44 the queen  Her name is Letizia and Letizia
00:02:47 used to be a television presenter,
00:02:51 television presenter, yes,
00:02:55 but before, it was different, for
00:03:00 example, Juan Carlos's wife, first,
00:03:05 Juan Carlos, Juan Carlos, first, was
00:03:10 the king.
00:03:15 the daughter of the kings
00:03:20 of greece

00:03:24 in greece there was a king and queen they
00:03:29 had sofia sofia yes yes her
00:03:35 parents her father her mother were kings but
00:03:39 now with letizia it has not changed it is
00:03:42 different
00:03:45 now king juan carlos first in spain'
00:03:49 many people want it there are many people
00:03:53 who want it
00:03:56 many Spaniards many Spaniards
00:04:00 love King Juan Carlos
00:04:03 even many people many people used to
00:04:08 say to me the monarchy I don't care about kings
00:04:15 but Juan Carlos yes Juan Carlos I
00:04:20 He likes it and for a long time 75% of
00:04:28 Spaniards
00:04:29 approved of Juan Carlos First they
00:04:32 liked it They said that Juan Carlos first
00:04:35 was fine
00:04:37 but something happened in 2012 In 2012 here
00:04:45 in Spain there was a crisis there was a crisis not
00:04:50 many people didn't have a job they didn't have
00:04:55 money and they  found out it was discovered that Juan
00:05:01 Carlos had first gone to Africa he
00:05:05 had gone to Africa
00:05:09 to Africa to hunt to hunt elephants to
00:05:15 kill elephants and many people many
00:05:21 people were angry with him and under
00:05:26 his approval he lowered
00:05:30 to 50% yes yes yes but now with  the change
00:05:36 with the new with the new king is
00:05:40 rising
00:05:42 again popularity of the
00:05:46 king of the queen of the royal house of the
00:05:50 royal family but now in Spain
00:05:54 there are also many people people who
00:06:00 wonder if it is really necessary to
00:06:04 do  missing to have to have a king and a
00:06:08 queen is it nice to have a king or queen
00:06:11 now in 2018
00:06:16 is it okay to have a king and queen
00:06:19 in todays modern world or kings and
00:06:24 queens is a thing of the past something that
00:06:27 t  We would have to forget
00:06:30 what do you think is it okay
00:06:34 or not okay to have a king not to have a

00:00:05 Hi, I'm Marsé Carvajalino and today I
00:00:09 want to talk about what
00:00:12 December means in Colombia, Christmas in
00:00:16 Colombia, its traditions, its food that
00:00:19 is made, that is played, that you eat
00:00:22 absolutely everything. To begin with, I want to
00:00:26 tell you that in Colombia
00:00:29 the season officially begins  Christmas on
00:00:34 December 7 with the day of the little candles and
00:00:38 you will wonder what is the day of
00:00:40 the little candles because there goes the day of
00:00:43 the little candles it is a very special day
00:00:45 because first it is the day of the Virgin of
00:00:49 the Immaculate Conception and it is  the day
00:00:53 where families get together, friends get together
00:00:56 and they literally light candles
00:01:00 in the windows in the streets on the
00:01:04 platforms where you can light the
00:01:09 candles and in fact it is very beautiful
00:01:12 because where you walk is all the people
00:01:15 gathered and there are all the  streets
00:01:18 lit by candles
00:01:21 so that day the Christmas season officially begins,
00:01:25 people gather and each
00:01:29 candle is a wish that you want
00:01:33 to make for your loved ones or for yourself.
00:01:36 Like a light,
00:01:39 each candle is a wish and a light that you
00:01:42 bring to someone or something. It is not a
00:01:47 very beautiful day and that is where the Christmas tradition begins
00:01:50 .
00:01:52 After this, the days go by and
00:01:55 the novenas begin, which are the novenas. It
00:01:59 is something similar to the posadas.  In Mexico, I
00:02:03 just don't have my piñata or ask for a
00:02:07 posada, but if you do
00:02:11 a different prayer for nine days depending on the
00:02:14 day, for this you have a book where
00:02:18 the day's prayer guides you and at the end,
00:02:22 and at the end, it ends with Christmas carols, no.
00:02:27 You end up singing Christmas carols. The idea of
00:02:30 the novenas is that every day it is done in
00:02:33 a different house, it is done
00:02:37 at the house of relatives or with friends, and it is
00:02:42 good that the prayer
00:02:44 of the day, the coexistence and the food make it special,
00:02:48 because whenever you come to pray a
00:02:51 ninth they receive you with buñuel or with the
00:02:55 custard, which are typical foods of
00:02:58 Colombia, only on these dates the custard
00:03:03 with arequipe with blackberry sauce the
00:03:07 buñuelo, which is a round dough,
00:03:12 has a round shape like a small
00:03:14 ball
00:03:16 Fried with flour and cheese,
00:03:20 then the cold one and well, that's the
00:03:25 fritter with the most herd. Well, it depends on
00:03:30 each house
00:03:32 and in the end, they all end up singing
00:03:35 Christmas carols and well,
00:03:39 also during these nine days that
00:03:42 start, if I'm not bad, there's  16 16 17 and
00:03:47 89
00:03:49 but the 16 forgives and the accounts
00:03:53 during these nine days there are also
00:03:56 some very traditional games
00:03:58 called my bonuses they are games
00:04:04 where bets are made there are not several
00:04:09 yes and no is one of them which is for
00:04:11 example
00:04:13 I'm going to play with you and we're going to play
00:04:17 like this and there no then you're going to say the
00:04:21 word what
00:04:24 can't you say for example you choose
00:04:27 no so you can't say no
00:04:33 all you're going to answer is yes and
00:04:38 if you want to say  no, you already do it with
00:04:41 words
00:04:42 I don't know negative
00:04:46 or what you want to say except for the
00:04:49 word no and I can't say the
00:04:51 word yes
00:04:53 that is one of the games there is also a
00:04:56 straw in your mouth which means that if
00:04:59 I tell you shake your mouth  you have to
00:05:02 open  your mouth and you have to have something in
00:05:04 your mouth if you don't lose and that's for everyone,
00:05:07 well, what they want is also there
00:05:12 and three feet
00:05:16 well and there are many
00:05:20 traditional games that are also played
00:05:22 during those nine days and
00:05:27 to close the bet
00:05:30 There is a song
00:05:35 that is made to close the promise that
00:05:37 is a wooden house, an iron house, if you
00:05:41 do not pay me you will go to hell
00:05:46 with that, seal the promise and
00:05:50 whoever loses has to pay so this
00:05:54 also goes during those nine days and
00:05:56 December 24th ends
00:06:01 and well December 24th arrives, it
00:06:05 is already Christmas
00:06:08 for us that day is Christmas you get together
00:06:11 with your family and the plan that you
00:06:16 decide and pray the last one not
00:06:21 good eat custard eat donut
00:06:27 music  Christmas
00:06:30 carols and at twelve at night
00:06:35 the gifts are usually opened and
00:06:39 also as you decide with your family
00:06:41 if you make an exchange or if you want to
00:06:45 give gifts to all your relatives at
00:06:48 twelve at night is the perfect time
00:06:50 to  Open to open the gifts and
00:06:54 well
00:06:56 after Christmas, well, on the 25th, which
00:07:00 is a holiday, you go with your family
00:07:03 to spend the hangover for a delicious breakfast. In
00:07:09 general, what many families do
00:07:12 is a barbecue, so after you
00:07:15 do your  24 the next day they all get together
00:07:22 and make a barbecue the day after
00:07:26 that is also very typical and well
00:07:29 then Christmas passes and December 28 comes
00:07:34 April Fool's Day which is
00:07:40 April Fool's Day this is very typical
00:07:44 in Colombia but I also know  that they do
00:07:46 in other countries
00:07:49 on April Fool's Day, as its
00:07:51 name says, it is the day for the
00:07:54 innocent to fall for the pranks that one makes on them,
00:07:57 so it is a literal day of pranks
00:08:01 that many people no longer fall for because they know that
00:08:04 this is the day  December 28, which is the day
00:08:08 where many pranks are made, but
00:08:10 it is also very traditional that on that day
00:08:13 one or another prank is made on friends or
00:08:16 family and when they fall, one
00:08:19 tells them Happy April Fools' Day and
00:08:25 well, the 28th passes.  of say  December and we are going to
00:08:31 December 31, which is the end of the year
00:08:36 and something typical that can be done
00:08:41 in Colombia is to celebrate the old year
00:08:46 and the new year and also the grapes, not
00:08:49 everyone has their belief, there are no ones
00:08:53 who wear yellow pants
00:08:56 or red depending if you want
00:08:59 money if you want love they eat
00:09:02 the 12 grapes at midnight and each grape
00:09:06 represents a wish
00:09:10 so many also do another
00:09:13 tradition of the 12th of 12 sorry December 31
00:09:18 is to grab a travel suitcase
00:09:22 and give it  around the block and they say
00:09:26 that if you do that you're going to travel all
00:09:29 year round
00:09:31 it can't work out maybe it doesn't I
00:09:34 know people who have done it and
00:09:36 traveled so each one my
00:09:40 grandmother for example
00:09:42 every year and grabs an
00:09:48 egg  You rub it all over your body
00:09:51 after bathing and at midnight
00:09:55 sharp in half a glass of water in a transparent glass
00:10:02 open the egg, throw it away in the glass of water
00:10:04 and put it under the bed and the next
00:10:09 day at 12  at noon he sees it and
00:10:14 p  Redice what will happen to you in the year
00:10:18 that is a very personal belief of
00:10:20 hers of hers I have done
00:10:25 it it has worked for me other times nothing comes out
00:10:28 but that also depends on each
00:10:31 person
00:10:32 and the thing about the old year is that with clothes  Old lady,
00:10:38 you make a doll,
00:10:40 you write to her as the negative things or
00:10:43 what you no longer want and what else
00:10:46 at 12 at night and it's like already this year
00:10:50 it's already burned, it's gone, it's already forgotten
00:10:54 and now to what  it comes ok
00:10:59 and well another very traditional thing in
00:11:03 colombia at least in my family is
00:11:08 to also note the negative things we
00:11:13 had or had in the year and we don't
00:11:16 want it to come in the new year
00:11:19 so we write them on a piece of paper and
00:11:22 put it in  an urn and also at
00:11:25 midnight we burn it
00:11:28 and also that it go away if
00:11:31 we don't manage to do like the old year the
00:11:33 doll
00:11:36 burn it and already say how I don't want this anymore well we
00:11:39 do the little papers and
00:11:41 we also write resolutions for the
00:11:44 new year
00:11:46 in this case  then we set purposes
00:11:48 for e  l 2020 and we make a list and
00:11:53 we keep that list, this
00:11:55 is something very personal because
00:11:58 what you are going to do during
00:12:02 that year are your purposes and the joke is that at the
00:12:06 end of the year you see the list and do
00:12:09 as  A check, well, the chili peppers
00:12:14 and say I fulfilled it, I did not fulfill it and you can
00:12:18 return to things that perhaps you did not do that
00:12:21 year and put them in the purpose of the following year
00:12:26 and well, that's how the year ends with the
00:12:31 toast since more of what you had  what to
00:12:34 burn you hugged what you had to
00:12:36 hug you kissed who you had to kiss
00:12:39 if you are lucky enough to have
00:12:42 your partner at twelve o'clock that day well give them
00:12:47 a kiss
00:12:49 and
00:12:52 good hugs the grapes dinner the dance
00:12:57 that lasts all night  and the same is
00:13:01 generally done on the first of
00:13:04 January
00:13:06 as for the guava to spend the day
00:13:13 and the year ends in the best way and
00:13:18 well I hope you liked these
00:13:23 Colombian traditions or well my
00:13:26 traditions
00:13:29 and this is done in  Colombia
00:13:33 and in  some parts of the world we
00:13:36 agree with some traditions but
00:13:39 hey that's all
00:13:42 this is a christmas and a december in
00:13:45 colombia and i hope that one day they can
00:13:47 go there

035,"00:00:00 Today I am going to explain to you how the
00:00:05 Iberian Peninsula was invaded
00:00:09 by tribes by Germanic tribes and because
00:00:14 now we have
00:00:18 completely forgotten about them
00:00:22 [Music]
00:00:28 as I explained to you in the previous video
00:00:32 in the 5th century, the 5th century did not  400 years
00:00:41 or so
00:00:43 after Christ it
00:00:46 was the fall of the Roman Empire
00:00:50 the Romans had the empire throughout
00:00:55 the Mediterranean and the western part the
00:01:00 part further west fell fell
00:01:05 for a long long time it was losing
00:01:09 power it was losing it it was having
00:01:13 less and less  and less power
00:01:17 and in the year 406 there were 33 tribes three
00:01:27 Germanic tribes from central Europe
00:01:30 that attacked the Roman Empire
00:01:36 they attacked it and that changed
00:01:40 a lot a large part of Europe changed a lot and in the
00:01:45 year 411 they reached the
00:01:52 Iberian Peninsula  and since the Romans
00:01:56 had no power there was no resistance there was no
00:02:01 resistance and they entered they entered the
00:02:05 peninsula and divided up the peninsula
00:02:10 the Iberian peninsula was divided  They were
00:02:15 yes but
00:02:18 the Romans the Romans wanted to
00:02:22 regain power and they gave permission to
00:02:26 another tribe another tribe the Visigoths
00:02:32 did not come the Visigoths and they told
00:02:37 the Romans I will recover the
00:02:41 Iberian Peninsula and I will give it to you and the
00:02:45 Romans said okay okay  come on
00:02:49 please and the Visigoths came and
00:02:53 took a very large part of the
00:02:57 peninsula but they did not give it to the
00:03:01 Romans no no they did not give it to them of course and at
00:03:06 that time in these years of the
00:03:10 Roman Empire only the eastern part remained the
00:03:15 eastern part the  eastern
00:03:21 part the eastern part of the
00:03:26 roman empire the eastern roman empire was
00:03:29 also called byzantine empire byzantine
00:03:34 because the capital was here
00:03:38 and byzantium or constantinople not what
00:03:43 is now istanbul
00:03:47 istanbul is here that's why it was the
00:03:51 byzantine empire well the byzantine empire
00:03:54 came  to take the south again
00:03:59 the south of the Iberian peninsula was
00:04:03 finally recovered by the Visigoths they
00:04:07 invaded the entire peninsula the entire Iberian
00:04:11 peninsula  ca everything belonged
00:04:14 to the Visigoths
00:04:18 but the Visigoths were very few there were
00:04:23 few people
00:04:26 people were few they did not change much they
00:04:30 did not change the population the people
00:04:34 of the peninsula did not change much they did not
00:04:39 mix with the people they did not mix they
00:04:43 did not marry so so so
00:04:49 and the  People from the peninsula did not change their
00:04:55 language the way they speak they did not
00:04:58 change it and now in Spanish in
00:05:02 our language there are some
00:05:06 Visigothic words there are some but very few very
00:05:10 very few
00:05:12 and later in the 8th century in the 8th century
00:05:18 the Visigoths were not there  they were very united they were not at
00:05:22 odds there were different
00:05:26 different parties
00:05:31 and that is why they were not very strong so
00:05:35 someone someone came someone took advantage of the fact
00:05:38 that they were not very strong and yes yes again
00:05:42 someone invaded the Iberian Peninsula'
00:05:46 someone took over the Iberian Peninsula
00:05:51 don't see this has more twists  It has more
00:05:55 changes than an episode of breaking bad
00:06:01 and I think that this time you know
00:06:04 who the invaders
00:06:08 were who came to the peninsula  a and they
00:06:12 invaded it if you know tell me in the
00:06:16 comments
00:06:17 below okay come see you later
00:06:31 completely

207,"00:00:00 Today I'm going to talk about the war that took place
00:00:04 between Spain and the US in these years
00:00:11 and how Spain lost Cuba and lost the
00:00:15 rest of its territories that it had in the
00:00:19 Pacific
00:00:22 [Music]
00:00:26 Hello, well, in the last video about the
00:00:31 history of Spain'  We are talking about the
00:00:34 restoration of the Bourbons, how the
00:00:37 Bourbons and the kings returned to
00:00:41 Spain and today I am going to talk about something
00:00:45 that happened at that time that happened between
00:00:50 1898 and 1899, which meant a great change
00:00:57 for Spain. It affected Spain a lot.
00:01:00 It greatly affected the
00:01:03 international perception of Spain and, of course, it also
00:01:06 greatly affected Cuba. If today we are going
00:01:10 to talk about the
00:01:11 Spanish-
00:01:13 American war, the war between Spain and the United States, and the
00:01:19 crisis of
00:01:20 1898 and its consequences, then
00:01:25 for a long time Spain took
00:01:29 decisions you made political decisions you
00:01:32 made decisions about trade
00:01:35 between america and spain you made them without
00:01:39 really taking into account the people
00:01:42 who lived in the spanish colonies in
00:01:46 the colonies in  What is now
00:01:49 Spanish America, many decisions were made
00:01:51 without taking into account the
00:01:54 opinion of those who lived in the
00:01:56 American colonies, so in another
00:01:59 video I already explained to you that during the
00:02:02 19th century many Spanish colonies became
00:02:06 independent, many colonies in
00:02:09 Spanish America became independent and
00:02:12 became  independent countries and
00:02:15 this gave rise to the war of cuba
00:02:19 in
00:02:21 1868 the war of cuba happened that lasted
00:02:25 until
00:02:27 1878 in 1878 spain won and
00:02:34 a treaty was signed and cuba cuba hoped
00:02:38 that even if they had lost spain would
00:02:41 take them more into account the treaties  In
00:02:44 a different way, it would give them more rights.
00:02:47 Basically, Cubans wanted to have
00:02:50 the same rights that the
00:02:52 Spanish inhabitants had in the
00:02:55 Iberian Peninsula in Europe and as we explained to you
00:02:59 in the previous video that in Spain there was
00:03:02 a system of government with two parties
00:03:05 and there was turnismo.  He took turns,
00:03:08 first one party governed, then the
00:03:11 other, then one after the other, and in
00:03:14 Cuba.  they began to do the same thing they
00:03:17 began to do the same thing
00:03:19 later in
00:03:20 [Music]
00:03:21 1888 slavery was abolished
00:03:25 from Spain the government of Spain
00:03:28 abolished slavery and no longer allowed
00:03:31 slaves to be kept and this is something that
00:03:35 had already been requested in Cuba since  They had already asked for a long time ago,
00:03:39 but in addition to this, Cuba
00:03:43 continued to ask for reforms. It asked for more
00:03:47 freedom to be able to decide its own
00:03:50 laws and from the peninsula, from Spain, well,
00:03:53 they didn't or they didn't approve those changes
00:03:58 or they didn't approve them as fast as the
00:04:01 Cubans would have wanted and they began to
00:04:04 an anti-spanish sentiment grew in
00:04:08 cuba then in
00:04:10 1893 josé martí founded the
00:04:16 Cuban revolutionary party the revolutionary party
00:04:18 which was a
00:04:20 political party that sought the independence of
00:04:24 cuba wanted cuba to be independent
00:04:27 counting on or allying with the united states
00:04:32 or with allied concerts in the us
00:04:36 then finally cuba  he rebels he
00:04:41 says he wants to be independent he
00:04:45 rebels against spain against good the
00:04:48 spanish the ej  Spanish army and such
00:04:51 that was there,
00:04:53 the Philippines also joined the Philippines in the Pacific,
00:04:56 which at that time were Spanish,
00:04:59 also joined that revolution,
00:05:02 so what is Spain doing
00:05:12 ?  be very smart spain saw that
00:05:16 the rebels were militias the rebels
00:05:20 because they knew the terrain they hid they
00:05:23 attacked by hiding they attacked in
00:05:26 specific places
00:05:28 then they fled and hid a war
00:05:31 a guerrilla war and to fight
00:05:35 against that spain said well we are going to
00:05:39 get them to die of  hungry that they
00:05:42 do not have food so spain took
00:05:45 all the peasants all in cuba that
00:05:48 produced food and put them in
00:05:52 concentration camps locked them up in camps so
00:05:56 they had to be there and
00:05:59 could not grow food and create
00:06:01 food that the rebels could later
00:06:04 go and  buy or steal or whatever no
00:06:07 but of course well that is very bad the
00:06:11 peasants because they were being
00:06:13 repressed  Two, there was not much food,
00:06:16 so the people who were in those
00:06:19 concentration camps did not have
00:06:22 enough to eat either. So, in
00:06:26 1897, Spain
00:06:31 changed the army general, the army general
00:06:34 who was in charge of fighting against the
00:06:37 Cuban revolution changed, and they put another  general
00:06:41 ramón blanco ramón blanco and ramón blanco
00:06:45 begins to listen to the problems that
00:06:48 the Cubans have that the Cubans complain about. It
00:06:52 seems that it was too late. The
00:06:55 Cuban revolutionaries already felt
00:07:00 they already realized that they were close to
00:07:03 victory and they did not want to miss out on
00:07:06 this opportunity.  The rebels
00:07:09 had also received support
00:07:13 from certain sectors of the US population from the
00:07:16 beginning, although it is not very clear to what
00:07:20 extent the US supported Cuba- supported the
00:07:25 independence of Cuba or was
00:07:28 against Spain. It seems that many
00:07:32 sectors of the population  the citizens
00:07:36 of the usa many were in favor of cuba
00:07:41 the public opinion a lot was in favor
00:07:43 of cuba what  The US newspapers had
00:07:48 been publishing news for a long time, sometimes they
00:07:52 could be exaggerated, about what was
00:07:55 happening in Cuba, about what
00:07:59 the Spanish government was doing in Cuba, but it
00:08:02 seems that the US government really did not
00:08:06 have much interest in going to a US war
00:08:10 .  It had economic interests with Cuba
00:08:14 and Spain, so they did a lot of trade
00:08:18 and were not interested in a war
00:08:21 that would lead to a crisis. There were, well,
00:08:24 many businessmen in the US who
00:08:28 had those interests and it seems that the
00:08:32 only reason why perhaps the US
00:08:35 government  It changed its strategy because of
00:08:39 public opinion so finally in
00:08:45 1898 the
00:08:47 US took the
00:08:49 battleship a large ship not a ship the
00:08:53 mail
00:08:54 the battleship maine and took it to
00:08:56 havana moored it in the port of
00:08:59 havana
00:09:02 the mein was in the port of havana
00:09:05 what happens that shortly after in February
00:09:10 the mail exploded the menu exploded yes and the
00:09:14 truth is that even today it is not
00:09:18 known for sure why it exploded if it was an
00:09:23 accident if it was  an attack then it
00:09:26 seems that the press the usa newspapers
00:09:30 blamed spain at that time
00:09:34 spain said that they had not been
00:09:37 spain said that they were innocent there are
00:09:41 several theories of what happened what happened that
00:09:45 day who made the maine explode it
00:09:48 is true that spain  at that time i
00:09:51 had zero interest in starting a war
00:09:56 against the usa spain was not interested
00:09:59 at all and it would be a bit silly to
00:10:03 destroy a ship
00:10:06 from a country that has a fleet of ships
00:10:09 a fleet of battleships much larger
00:10:12 than yours but still  so that was the
00:10:15 theory that was approved by the
00:10:19 us congress the theory was that they had placed
00:10:24 a mine they had placed a mine under the ship
00:10:27 not a bomb that had
00:10:29 exploded another theory it could be that it
00:10:32 had been an accident with the
00:10:35 explosives they had  on the ship
00:10:37 there would have been a fire first and
00:10:40 then it would have touched explosives and it
00:10:44 would have exploded
00:10:45 I think a hypothesis a hypothesis that
00:10:48 I think is very feasible would have
00:10:50 It makes a lot of sense that
00:10:54 Cuban revolutionaries would have blown up the ship
00:10:58 to make the
00:11:02 Americans think that it
00:11:04 was the Spanish and give
00:11:08 the US armies a reason
00:11:11 to help them in their fight, no, and well,
00:11:14 even after the explosion of the
00:11:17 Maine on  us government still took
00:11:22 a while was looking for ways to
00:11:25 fix this without starting a war
00:11:28 but a few months later in april it was
00:11:32 declared war usa declared
00:11:35 war and well it happened the war was a
00:11:38 pretty quick war didn't last
00:11:41 long lasted from april to  december
00:11:44 and in december peace was signed peace was signed
00:11:48 between the usa and spain and well
00:11:51 a peace was signed with
00:11:54 especially negative conditions for spain spain
00:11:56 really lost the war it is also
00:11:59 true that the ships the strongest ships
00:12:03 of the spanish navy of the
00:12:06 Spanish army did not enter the
00:12:09 war did not participate in the war
00:12:12 perhaps it gives the impression that Spain perhaps already
00:12:16 considered that
00:12:18 it was lost, it did not want to lose more of
00:12:22 its army than necessary, perhaps
00:12:25 spain already thought that there was going to be
00:12:27 no way to govern cuba when
00:12:32 the cubans really did not want
00:12:34 'spain to govern itself, not then
00:12:36 while this war was going on we said that
00:12:40 in the philippines also the  Filipinos
00:12:43 rebelled in the Philippines there was even
00:12:46 less Spanish army than in Cuba the
00:12:50 rebels in the Philippines were many more
00:12:53 than the Spanish army at that time
00:12:56 and good from Spain because the Philippines is
00:12:59 on the other side of the world it is not very
00:13:01 difficult to get there quickly especially in
00:13:05 That moment more than 100 years ago and
00:13:07 since the US was at war with Spain, the
00:13:11 US also went to the Philippines, it
00:13:15 also sent ships to the Philippines and
00:13:19 helped the rebels and well, we already know that
00:13:22 later the US would take the Philippines
00:13:25 for itself, no, and well, after that
00:13:29 this spain abandons the philippines
00:13:31 abandons cuba and abandons puerto rico
00:13:35 too and these three places
00:13:38 become protectorates of the usa  They
00:13:42 become regions that the US
00:13:45 controlled but only to
00:13:48 protect them for now so this is
00:13:52 called the disaster of 98 this from
00:13:56 Spain because it was seen very negatively
00:13:59 Spain had lost it had just
00:14:02 lost its world empire not many people
00:14:06 criticized the government they criticized the
00:14:10 Spanish army and  This kind of damaged the pride
00:14:15 of a lot of people, it caused
00:14:18 nationalist
00:14:20 feelings, right-wing feelings in Spain,
00:14:24 feelings that we Spaniards are
00:14:27 good and we have to prove it
00:14:30 because those right-wing movements
00:14:35 also began to gain strength in
00:14:37 Spain from that moment on, then
00:14:41 among all of us.  These conflicts
00:14:43 killed more or less 50 thousand 50,000
00:14:47 people so well it was a
00:14:50 short but considerable war quite a few
00:14:54 people died and well apart from this
00:14:58 in Spain it did not generate
00:15:01 very big economic problems it did not end in a
00:15:05 very big economic crisis because
00:15:08 what Spain really invested in  this
00:15:11 war was little but good the
00:15:13 empire and  Spanish it's over with this it's
00:15:16 really over we had some
00:15:19 colonies left but especially in north
00:15:22 africa we no longer had anything
00:15:25 in the pacific or in america and well
00:15:28 tell me what you thought of this episode
00:15:32 tell me if you knew there was a war between the
00:15:36 usa and spain and  well in the next
00:15:40 episode we will return to spain we will see what
00:15:45 happened to this political system in which
00:15:49 the two most important leaders had died
00:15:52 and which coincided with the
00:15:55 first world war and we will see what
00:15:58 happened in spain during those years and

00:00:13 [Music]
00:00:16 Hi Well, a new
00:00:21 Monkey Island
00:00:24 to Monkey Island game just came out And yes I want to play I
00:00:28 wanted to play because this game brings me a
00:00:32 lot of nostalgia I played  to these games
00:00:36 i have played a couple of monkey
00:00:39 island games when i was little
00:00:41 this is already the sixth it is the number 6 game
00:00:45 of monkey island but it is the third from the
00:00:49 original creator of the game and this game
00:00:53 continues more or less continues with the
00:00:57 story of  the first two games are okay
00:01:01 then
00:01:03 to get a bit of an idea a bit of
00:01:06 context let's open this the scrapbook
00:01:12 here Explain what had already happened the
00:01:16 previous story so we'll know
00:01:18 who is who What happened is okay since I was
00:01:22 little I've always wanted to be  a
00:01:25 great pirate
00:01:26 So
00:01:28 guybrash is the name of the character he is
00:01:31 the protagonist no
00:01:40 so in the past to be a pirate you
00:01:43 had to pass three tests that
00:01:45 proved your worth you your courage
00:01:48 not your bravery
00:01:50 So what tests were
00:01:53 the search for treasures is important
00:01:56 for every pirate you had to show
00:01:58 that you knew how to find a treasure
00:02:02 your watching sword fighting required
00:02:05 more cunning than skill you also had to
00:02:08 pass the sword fighting test and
00:02:11 the robbery test  I had to sneak into
00:02:14 the governor's mansion the
00:02:16 security was extreme I had to
00:02:19 show that I could steal because of
00:02:22 course pirates steal it's not their job very
00:02:26 well and yes Tell me more about this woman
00:02:30 this was when I met elín the love of
00:02:33 my life then she was the  governor his
00:02:36 love his darling was the governor of The
00:02:40 Island she was the boss of The Island ok
00:02:43 everything took an unexpected turn while
00:02:46 doing the three tests
00:02:48 What happened Ellen was kidnapped and taken
00:02:51 to Monkey Island at the hands of the infamous
00:02:54 ghost pirate lechak The
00:02:56 ghost pirate is is  this is not him chach i thought
00:03:00 he was in love with eleine vale he was
00:03:03 gathering a crew Carla otis and
00:03:06 mithuk accompanied me on my journey
00:03:09 to Monkey Island  to save eleine it's
00:03:12 okay if these three very well What else my
00:03:17 first boat was the sea monkey I
00:03:20 bought it in the second-hand boats of
00:03:22 Stand with a credit that counterfeits it's okay he
00:03:25 bought a boat and with his crew his
00:03:28 three people his three companions went  to
00:03:32 the island of lechak to Monkey Island to
00:03:35 rescue him
00:03:38 Monkey Island was a volcanic
00:03:41 and smoking mystery volcano not covered in jungle
00:03:44 did not appear that the maps did not appear
00:03:49 on the island there was a statue of a
00:03:51 giant monkey head that hid
00:03:53 underground catacombs hid like  a
00:03:57 good like a cemetery not a place
00:04:00 where there are people buried under the ground
00:04:03 underground ok we had to make a
00:04:07 potion to find Monkey Island
00:04:09 substitute some ingredients I use other
00:04:11 ingredients but we got there anyway
00:04:14 ok this I don't know if I want you to tell me
00:04:17 more about this
00:04:19 The ghost ship  of lechak anchored in
00:04:22 a lava lake hidden under the
00:04:25 surface of the island the ship was in
00:04:27 a lava lake it would be a bank a
00:04:32 ghost ship not because a wooden ship
00:04:36 cannot be in a lake of lava I
00:04:39 knew a shipwrecked German Tuth the
00:04:42 inhabitants and he argued a lot about the
00:04:44 letter
00:04:47 we returned to the scrum island for the
00:04:50 amazing outcome of my first and great
00:04:52 adventure
00:04:53 worth I managed to reach  the church Just in
00:04:56 time to stop the wedding to
00:04:59 stop chat from marrying Ellen but
00:05:02 elain are cute ok turns
00:05:06 out Lane already had it all under
00:05:08 control how does he do it then
00:05:11 guys no no I don't help her
00:05:15 I beat the echack he basically
00:05:17 blew
00:05:19 up by then  he had discovered that
00:05:22 ghosts like lechak are vulnerable to
00:05:25 root beer he attacked him with beer
00:05:28 ok This was the start of something magical
00:05:32 I think this was the first
00:05:34 game I think
00:05:35 so those are from when I went
00:05:39 looking for the vicuo treasure ok  then he
00:05:41 went looking for a treasure he
00:05:43 met his friend Wally he
00:05:47 found The voodoo Sorceress of the international house
00:05:52 treasure map
00:05:55 ok again the chat he ended up
00:05:58 facing  al echack and they used magic
00:06:03 he turned into a statue
00:06:06 they buried him very well I knew Murray
00:06:10 a skull a talking skull
00:06:13 I remember the skull
00:06:15 and then
00:06:17 elene and I
00:06:20 ellebras got married when it was all over
00:06:22 ok And this was a great day Although to
00:06:27 Tono  Posado We shouldn't know
00:06:29 the catering manager when scamcar okay
00:06:33 Well I think we more or less
00:06:36 know the story
00:06:38 okay This was the time Chuck
00:06:41 allied himself with an Australian
00:06:43 billionaire and tried to use a mystical talisman
00:06:45 to delineate his girlfriend well it seems
00:06:49 that  More or less the same thing is happening, not
00:06:52 to see if there is any other character that
00:06:55 we want to meet Morgan leflame
00:06:58 betrayed me okay This is a character that
00:07:01 betrayed him
00:07:04 and well with this he managed to
00:07:07 defeat the hechak again and that's it Okay then

00:13:06 man took the peg leg from a
00:13:09 boy who had a peg leg, no, I didn't

00:15:18 metal is it is not a doubloon but it is a
00:15:21 metal disc that looks similar in size and shape it is
00:15:25 called a chanfla it is like counterfeit money
00:15:27 a chanfla is worth I don't know what a
00:15:32 chanfla is but thinking about the chanfla I will
00:15:34 think about  the chanfla at the beginning at the
00:15:36 beginning I thought they were doubloon it
00:15:37 looks a lot like it Well I'm going to remove it the
00:15:41 counterfeit money is worth almost as much as the
00:15:43 real thing

00:19:48 look at the anchor
00:19:51 piece of anchor
00:19:54 that shows how little I  you understand
00:19:56 anchors This is not a very good example
00:19:58 you would know If you had read
00:19:59 as much about anchors as I did you knew that
00:20:02 anchors were not designed to hold
00:20:04 ships still
00:20:06 they were used in combat  s were fired with
00:20:08 you're making this up with cannons like
00:20:11 Hook to board them they
00:20:13 began to make them bigger because that's how they
00:20:14 caused more damage
00:20:16 until people realized that what
00:20:18 happened when you missed and they went to the
00:20:20 bottom of the sea
00:20:21 that is sinking  sleeping I think I'm going to
00:20:24 skip the vocabulary the dialogue this
00:20:28 girl is very repellent she doesn't remind me of
00:20:31 Hermione and Harry Potter at the beginning
00:20:33 in the first book
00:20:36 I can't skip it everything is okay I
00:20:42 mean she was making it up I mean she
00:20:43 was saying that the  anchors began
00:20:45 as harpoons if you missed something
00:20:48 press comma to see the
00:20:50 previous sentences Ah very well

00:26:41 I don't see them
00:26:45 here there is nothing not to
00:26:48 rehearse sword fighting Ah sword fighting
00:26:51 is something mythical  of this game
00:26:53 because the fight with the sword is a fight of
00:26:56 speech, it is a fight of dialogue, not with
00:26:59 real swords, at least let's see in
00:27:02 the first game,
00:27:04 it doesn't seem that they are really fighting
00:27:06 with the scurvy as if they
00:27:09 were swords.
00:27:11 Well, that's good.  It's been fun
00:27:15 Okay, well, nothing. What else do I have here to
00:27:18 do?

",3
061,"00:00:00 Today I'm going to talk about Christopher Columbus's
00:00:04 colon, how he prepared his trip, how he
00:00:08 organized his trip, and his first trip to
00:00:12 America
00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:18 Hello, well,
00:00:20 I guess I imagine you
00:00:25 know Columbus, you know Christopher
00:00:29 Columbus, Christopher Columbus was a man, not
00:00:34 Christopher Columbus.  He was the man who
00:00:40 discovered America who discovered it for
00:00:44 the Europeans not in America in the
00:00:49 Americas there were already natives there were
00:00:52 indigenous people and America they had gone before
00:00:56 the Vikings had gone the Chinese had gone
00:01:01 but the Europeans most of the Europeans
00:01:04 did not know about it they did not know that here  there
00:01:09 was a continent here there was an
00:01:13 entire continent that the new world was here
00:01:17 and Christopher Columbus was the one who
00:01:21 discovered it and then he came back and said it he
00:01:25 told the others true because 'Christopher
00:01:29 Columbus' lived in the time of the
00:01:34 Catholic kings the  kings not
00:01:39 the catholic kings
00:01:44 as i already told you i explained it to you in another
00:01:47 video the catholic
00:01:51 kings the catholic kings
00:01:55 finished reconquering spain in 1492
00:02:05 and in 1492 it was e  he same year that
00:02:10 Columbus arrived in America
00:02:14 and Columbus arrived in America in 1492 but
00:02:20 Colom Color did not know he did not know it was
00:02:24 America at that time it was not called
00:02:27 America no no
00:02:30 because Columbus Columbus thought that the
00:02:34 world the world the planet not what  the
00:02:38 earth was smaller than the planet
00:02:41 was smaller they thought it was
00:02:44 smaller than america did not exist and columbus
00:02:48 colon wanted to reach the indies he wanted to
00:02:52 reach asia yes that is why when they arrived
00:02:57 when they arrived in america the people
00:03:01 the people who lived here  They
00:03:04 called them Indians yes Indians and from 1492
00:03:11 to 1500
00:03:15 7 everyone everyone thought
00:03:19 they were in the Indies that Colom
00:03:22 had reached the Indies he had
00:03:25 reached Asia but in 1507
00:03:29 they realized they realized
00:03:32 that it was not  another continent and in 1507
00:03:37 they changed its name they began to
00:03:40 call it america from 1507 it was
00:03:44 called america and it was because of the
00:03:49 voyage of columbus to america that many
00:03:53 countries many countries in europe began
00:03:57 to conquer they began to conquer
00:04:01 other countries to go to other countries to go to
00:04:06 many to africa to asia
00:04:10 and to america of course and now
00:04:14 we now know that in 1481 colon colony wanted to
00:04:22 go to the indies wanted to go to asia through the
00:04:29 west not to the east but  towards the
00:04:33 west and in 1481 colon was already thinking
00:04:38 of going to the indies
00:04:42 and colon especially
00:04:46 wanted to get to cipango cipango is the
00:04:51 old name of japan is
00:04:55 what japan was called before cipango
00:04:58 and colon wanted to get to acipan gogh
00:05:02 because at this time in  these years there was
00:05:06 no trade with japan they did not buy
00:05:10 and sell things there was no trade with
00:05:13 japan but they heard stories they had heard
00:05:18 stories that there was a lot of gold in japan
00:05:21 there was gold and gold well it costs a lot a
00:05:25 lot of money no and color i
00:05:29 wanted to find a way
00:05:31 to get to japan to cipango
00:05:35 then colom color looked at a map I looked at
00:05:40 a a map not
00:05:43 a map of the planet of
00:05:48 the planet earth I looked at a map and saw saw the
00:05:53 length the size of  the equator of the
00:05:57 equator around here
00:06:02 and
00:06:04 colom saw there are so many miles not
00:06:11 so many miles but colón colón did not know
00:06:17 what other miles were at this time in
00:06:20 these years there were several units not the
00:06:24 same as now we have kilometers
00:06:27 we have miles in this at this time they
00:06:31 had  several miles there were
00:06:34 different miles and colón
00:06:37 colom thought it was
00:06:42 italian miles he thought these miles on the
00:06:46 map were italian miles of italy
00:06:49 but they were not arabic miles in arabic countries
00:06:54 another unit was used other miles
00:06:58 and he was wrong it was thought that the planet
00:07:02 that  the earth was smaller
00:07:05 so colom went to portugal
00:07:10 colom colom went to portugal
00:07:13 colom lived in portugal for a while and
00:07:17 colom got married there he had a wife he had
00:07:21 a son in portugal
00:07:23 and colom went to the king to the king of portugal he
00:07:29 went to the king to ask him for money king  give me
00:07:32 money give me money because i will go to the indies i will
00:07:36 go to asia for you and from asia i
00:07:41 will find a way to
00:07:44 get to asia for you
00:07:47 but the king of portugal gave him  ijo no no no
00:07:50 no no no
00:07:52 because also colom asked for many
00:07:55 things he asked for a lot of money for him he
00:07:59 asked for a lot of things and the king said
00:08:03 no
00:08:04 so colom left and went to spain
00:08:07 yes he went to spain which at this time
00:08:10 was the  kingdom of castile there were several
00:08:13 kingdoms he went to the kingdom of castile
00:08:17 and in castile colon asked the kings
00:08:21 the same thing he asked for money money for
00:08:25 boats money for sailors for
00:08:28 crew for his boats money to
00:08:31 pay people to go with him to
00:08:34 asia not to  the indies
00:08:39 twice twice the catholic kings
00:08:43 told him that they didn't say
00:08:46 no
00:08:48 and so because colom also asked for
00:08:52 many things he asked for a percentage he asked for
00:08:57 a percentage of everything that came from
00:09:00 america or the indies he also asked to
00:09:04 be governor to
00:09:07 be  chief be no not a king but be like
00:09:11 a president not the governor of all
00:09:14 the zones of all the territories in
00:09:18 the indies that are conquests in that the
00:09:21 conquistadors of spain' conquests in
00:09:25 but in this  in portugal times portugal
00:09:29 found something
00:09:32 portugal found
00:09:36 portugal came here and found the
00:09:40 cape cape of good hope found the
00:09:44 tip the southern tip of africa they found
00:09:48 a way to go to the indies and
00:09:52 that was very useful for portugal
00:09:56 to trade to buy  and selling
00:09:59 things with the indies with asia
00:10:03 then the catholic kings began
00:10:08 to get nervous oysters the
00:10:11 portuguese have found it they know how to go to
00:10:14 the indies
00:10:16 and they decided
00:10:19 to give it support colom support
00:10:24 colom's trip his trip they decided ok the
00:10:28 portuguese have found this we
00:10:31 We are going to look for another way
00:10:36 then the third time the third time
00:10:39 that Colom asked for help he asked
00:10:42 for support for the trip the Catholic kings
00:10:45 told him that it was okay and Colom Columbus
00:10:51 began to prepare his trip he began to
00:10:55 organize the trip to the Indies  to asia
00:11:00 then they left from palos de la
00:11:04 frontera they left from huelva
00:11:09 from palos de la frontera in huelva
00:11:13 three boats left no 33 boat  s
00:11:20 three boats and 90 people 90 people
00:11:25 left they set sail they left us from palos
00:11:30 de palos they went to the canary islands here are
00:11:35 the canary islands they stopped in the canary islands and
00:11:39 then they went to and from america it
00:11:44 was a very long
00:11:47 trip it was a trip it was a trip of 36 36 days
00:11:54 and  It was a very hard trip, very hard, very
00:11:57 exhausting.
00:11:59 The food the food they were carrying
00:12:02 was rotting was rotting.
00:12:24 ship the crew rebelled they
00:12:28 rebelled it means that they began to
00:12:32 demand they began to tell colom no no
00:12:35 no you you are not the boss
00:12:39 now we now command and we leave we return
00:12:42 to spain
00:12:45 and colon colon and the others his helpers
00:12:51 let's say
00:12:53 and they managed to convince  talking to the
00:12:56 crew talking to the sailors they
00:12:59 managed to convince them they managed to
00:13:03 convince them to
00:13:06 keep looking  or that they would continue
00:13:09 for three days only three days
00:13:11 to continue searching and when
00:13:16 this happened they had already seen they had already seen
00:13:19 plants in the water they had seen
00:13:23 birds flying near the boat so
00:13:26 they knew they knew that
00:13:29 surely there was land nearby
00:13:34 then colom convinced the
00:13:38 crew to continue searching for three
00:13:41 days and two days after two
00:13:45 days they found land they found an
00:13:48 island an island in the Caribbean
00:13:53 and they arrived at an island they arrived at an
00:13:57 island and it was an island where there were
00:13:59 indigenous people there were people there were people
00:14:04 living there there were tribes living there
00:14:07 and it was a friendly contact they gave
00:14:12 things they gave gifts
00:14:15 and yes they were very kind to each
00:14:18 other but here at this moment colom
00:14:23 colony was thinking of enslaving them
00:14:27 he was already thinking of controlling
00:14:31 them by telling them what they had to do not making them
00:14:34 their slaves and  Colom wrote it, he
00:14:37 wrote what I was already thinking about,
00:14:39 these people don't have weapons, they don't have
00:14:44 swords do not have guns therefore it
00:14:48 would be very easy it would be very easy to make them
00:14:51 our slaves no
00:14:55 but colom did not find the gold he did not
00:14:59 find gold he did not find the gold they
00:15:01 were looking for they did not find it and
00:15:05 on their first trip on their first trip to
00:15:09 america they only stopped at  islands
00:15:13 were in several islands of the caribbean they
00:15:17 were in hispaniola la española
00:15:20 where haiti is now they were in
00:15:23 cuba but they did not reach the continent they did not
00:15:28 reach land to the continent of
00:15:31 america only to the islands
00:15:34 and while they were sailing while moving
00:15:38 around the islands a ship sank  one of
00:15:43 the boats sank and they were left with
00:15:46 two with two boats
00:15:49 and some of the men some of the
00:15:52 sailors stayed in
00:15:55 america and the rest the two boats
00:16:00 went back to spain- they
00:16:03 went back to spain with 10 indigenous people 10
00:16:08 people from the islands 10 indigenous people who
00:16:13 lived on the islands took them away they
00:16:15 left together they went to spain together
00:16:20 and they also took their things  and they took
00:16:23 objects they took animals from america
00:16:27 they took them to spain to show them
00:16:30 no
00:16:32 and colom arrived in spain and then went to
00:16:36 barcelona he arrived and went to barcelona because
00:16:41 the kings the kings were in barcelona
00:16:44 colom went to speak with the kings
00:16:48 some of them came from  the indigenous people of the
00:16:52 indigenous people of the native americans
00:16:54 also came with colom they went to
00:16:56 barcelona and right away the father in italy
00:17:01 the pope not in the vatican in rome in
00:17:07 italy he found out he found out the news
00:17:10 then the news spread throughout
00:17:14 europe throughout europe  The news was heard very
00:17:17 quickly, everyone found out, or they have
00:17:20 reached Asia, they have reached the West Indies.
00:17:27 In the next video, in the next
00:17:30 video, I will tell you about the other voyages of
00:17:34 Columbus. Columbus made several voyages and
00:17:38 I will talk about things not  very good

066,"00:00:00 Today my friend Maximiliano is here hello
00:00:05 how are you nice to meet you and Maximiliano is going
00:00:09 to talk to us he is going to tell us a story
00:00:12 about a lizard a lizard yes good
00:00:21 [Music]
00:00:24 hello hello well
00:00:27 yes this is Maximiliano and explain
00:00:31 a little bit who you are
00:00:33 ok this  My name is Brito
00:00:37 Maximiliano. I come from Mexico,
00:00:40 Mexico City, known as Mexico City.
00:00:44 I am a web programmer, I work in a bank,
00:00:48 currently a programmer, just like me
00:00:50 before,
00:00:52 yes, the programmer and well, I currently
00:00:56 live in Thailand. I have been living
00:00:58 here for a year working at the  university I was
00:01:02 an exchange student for one year too
00:01:04 so in total I've been
00:01:06 living in Thailand for
00:01:08 two years and this story the story of the
00:01:11 lizard also happened in Thailand
00:01:14 ok well tell us what happened well I at
00:01:20 the university of de me fall wine is very
00:01:24 beautiful
00:01:25 me for  I'm a student and at night I'm
00:01:28 going for a run. It's a university in the
00:01:30 north of Thailand in the north and
00:01:32 near Chiang Rai. I think many
00:01:36 know it.  n maybe then I used to go
00:01:38 running you were going to run yes to
00:01:40 exercise yes at night
00:01:44 on one occasion I had to go to the bathroom and it
00:01:48 was all dark and I mean damn the bathroom
00:01:51 is very far because I was
00:01:53 running all over the university complex
00:01:55 So I go to a cabin and I say I think
00:01:58 it's a bathroom so I go to the
00:02:01 cabin
00:02:02 and see the light A cabin is like a
00:02:05 little house A small house It's a small
00:02:12 building It's not a house where people live,
00:02:14 but it's a small
00:02:16 wooden construction  Maybe yes,
00:02:18 and if there is something neglected or something dirty,
00:02:23 but it was a sink, a toilet, a bathroom,
00:02:27 it seems that it was a bathroom and a
00:02:31 warehouse, although I remember valuing more in
00:02:33 a place where they kept things there and
00:02:35 damages that were the wells on the
00:02:39 Valencia floor.  just an exact hole
00:02:42 in the floor and there he relieved
00:02:45 himself yes okay so I go into the room and
00:02:49 turn on the light it flashes and when it comes on
00:02:52 you see where the mirror behind me
00:02:55 was a kind of lizard but that kind of
00:02:59 thing  It's okay, I mean, you look at
00:03:02 the mirror and the lizard was behind it,
00:03:03 well, where I'm also on the wall, on the
00:03:06 wall,
00:03:07 and I say what is that, like
00:03:11 bands, and I think that of that size,
00:03:13 very bright colors are worth many
00:03:16 colors.  and spikes on the back okay it
00:03:19 had some spikes are the spikes and here
00:03:21 on the back some spikes and I say that
00:03:25 's it
00:03:27 and I say nobody is going to believe me so
00:03:30 slowly he put my hand in my pocket
00:03:33 but I see him to take out my cell phone and
00:03:36 take some guarantees to take the mobile
00:03:38 if to take a photo of the lizard
00:03:41 because that way your friends your family will
00:03:43 believe that they all loved me otherwise if you
00:03:45 tell them a lizard like that they will say nothing
00:03:48 exaggerated you are an exaggeration that is to say
00:03:50 okay that doesn't exist but by then
00:03:53 I'll go  putting my manual into my mobile
00:03:57 phone a
00:04:00 watch in his pocket and he saw that the lizard was slowly
00:04:02 walking and looking at me and while he was
00:04:06 walking he looked at me watching without seeing what he is going
00:04:09 to do slowly
00:04:11 then I well do the two  s slowly
00:04:14 but not then he heard thunder a
00:04:18 noise in the window
00:04:23 taken from the planner of the wood or something
00:04:26 maybe yes then we both got
00:04:29 scared and quickly I ran out today the
00:04:32 lizard also got into the
00:04:34 bathroom well oscar we ran out of there  You
00:04:39 don't see that type of animal in, at
00:04:44 least in the region where I lived in
00:04:45 Mexico, in Mexico, there are no lizards, they
00:04:47 are so big, I never saw one, maybe it goes
00:04:50 there, but I didn't see any and in the end
00:04:53 you couldn't take the photo and now  no
00:04:55 one no one believes you I prefer not to count ready
00:04:59 I believe you I believe you okay thanks
00:05:01 because here in Thailand I have also
00:05:03 seen very large lizards
00:05:05 yes they are in many places in the north in
00:05:08 the south in many places those of the
00:05:10 bye praya river which are the little monkeys  leezer and that they
00:05:14 swim through the water continue like this in lumpini

00:05:24 crocodiles but they are very big
00:05:26 if I have seen them in the park
00:05:27 that I  They try to eat the pigeons

092,"00:00:00 Today my mother is going to explain to us, she is going to tell us about
00:00:05 a trip, a very interesting trip
00:00:08 that she took, hello, well,
00:00:19 this trip, where was it, where did
00:00:23 you go, well, this year at Christmas I went
00:00:27 to La Gomera, an island in the Canary Islands, La
00:00:31 Gomera, which is in the Canary Islands.  They
00:00:34 are islands that are part of Spain
00:00:37 but they are close to the African coast, they
00:00:40 are quite a bit to the south, yes, yes, but
00:00:46 you had already been to the Canary Islands before, if you had
00:00:49 gone to other islands, you had gone to Tenerife
00:00:51 and Fuerteventura. Tenerife and Fuerteventura,
00:00:53 which are Tenerife, is  Fuerteventura is a very big island,
00:00:55 not so much, not
00:00:58 Fuerteventura, it is smaller, but a
00:01:00 lot of people also go to
00:01:01 Fuerteventura, yes, it is very famous for
00:01:03 windsurfing and kitesurfing, and windsurfing, and gays are
00:01:07 very good, but this time it was not adjusted
00:01:11 to La Gomera, yes, the  La Gomera is very small, it
00:01:13 is very small,
00:01:15 and why did you want to go to the humidity?
00:01:26 Regrettably there is a tree that
00:01:28 is different that there is only someone if
00:01:30 in la gomera if forests like this so big
00:01:32 of that tree yes because it is very very very
00:01:37 good for
00:01:40 hiking for hiking for excursions this is
00:01:43 not for walking in the mountains  It's very
00:01:45 good, yes, and above all because on
00:01:49 January 8th it was hot there, in January
00:01:53 in Spain, it's cold there, it's hot,
00:01:56 it's fine, it's fine with a
00:01:58 spring temperature
00:02:00 and the trip there, as you were, the trip
00:02:05 is a bit  long plane there is an airport
00:02:08 in the humerus there is an airport in la
00:02:09 gomera but there are very few planes and they go
00:02:12 from tenerife which is next door yesterday is
00:02:15 that i fly first to tenerife and then
00:02:18 yes but i didn't go like that i didn't i flew first
00:02:22 to tenerife there is  an airport in the
00:02:24 north of tenerife then by car
00:02:27 from the north of tenerife to the south of
00:02:30 tenerife and there we took a ferry to
00:02:33 la gomera and by ferry to ife
00:02:36 rent this record che no no in la
00:02:39 gomera we rent combat  and the car
00:02:41 enters tenerife it was a taxi one
00:02:44 took us a guy we met on the plane
00:02:46 space friends on the plane if i take them it
00:02:49 's to the south
00:02:52 and there you saw them on a ferry and in la
00:02:54 gomera rent this is a car by car
00:02:56 so i had a car itself how many
00:02:58 xerais we were 22 you and a friend a friend
00:03:02 like that a friend yes and what was your
00:03:05 experience in la gomera what was your
00:03:08 first impression well my first
00:03:10 impression is that in a very
00:03:12 small place the capital san sebastián
00:03:15 We arrived starving from La Gomera and where
00:03:17 we ate there were very few restaurants
00:03:18 and few restaurants and it was like a
00:03:22 town the port if they were a town
00:03:24 the port of San Sebastián de la Gomera
00:03:27 a good little port
00:03:31 and there were very few restaurants it was
00:03:33 hard for us to find a place  to eat and everything
00:03:35 and get off a lot of people on the ferry on the
00:03:37 ferry yes a
00:03:38 lot of people got off there yes a lot
00:03:41 especially a lot of hikers and benches
00:03:44 backpackers with the drops in jersey there are a
00:03:46 lot of backpackers  eros and there were a lot of
00:03:49 tourists on the island, not really
00:03:50 in those days we weren't already in the
00:03:53 low season and there wasn't much chicha
00:03:55 at Christmas and not just weeks
00:03:58 before yes because we went
00:03:59 after Christmas of course on January 8 a lot of
00:04:02 people are already starting  to work or start to
00:04:04 go to school and it's low season
00:04:07 so there were few people yes but it
00:04:10 's a very touristy place with many
00:04:12 hotels not many hotels there aren't more
00:04:15 like apartments what I knew best were
00:04:17 apartments for rent so
00:04:19 people rent a  apartment an
00:04:20 apartment is like a flat like where
00:04:23 one lives a family can live but it is
00:04:25 to rent for vacations rent a
00:04:27 few days or a few weeks
00:04:30 and that was the most fun things you
00:04:34 did in which the most fun the
00:04:38 most fun and good the excursions to the
00:04:42 forest to the woods is walking they
00:04:45 were very beautiful 2006 wherever you are in a
00:04:48 tent we didn't sleep in the
00:04:51 apartment in the apartment we came and went
00:04:53 this  It's one thing although it
00:04:55 traumatized me a bit because I had to
00:04:57 drive
00:04:58 my friend doesn't drive because he's afraid
00:05:02 he hasn't driven for many years and I
00:05:05 had to drive
00:05:09 so the island is very small but they
00:05:12 're all like ravines they're all
00:05:15 ravines from the center of  the island and
00:05:16 ravines that you can fall into
00:05:19 are not what it is like to call it as an
00:05:24 exact valley like valleys baths and this vallès
00:05:26 vallès vallès everything like arteries like
00:05:28 arteries around the island it
00:05:30 is quite round it is round and
00:05:33 so it has galleries between each
00:05:35 artery and a valley  a valley in a valley in a
00:05:37 valley so those are curves the
00:05:39 roads are fine because not
00:05:42 many cars go by but it was the one you listen to in
00:05:46 burgos to go up and down yes so
00:05:50 even if you didn't go very far but yes
00:05:52 then I
00:05:53 drive very well in the morning  but in the afternoon
00:05:55 when she is tired it costs her less than
00:05:58 driving so
00:06:00 then there was a day that we were going to a
00:06:03 far place and I said no by bus the
00:06:08 car in  bus and we returned by ferry which
00:06:12 is also something that is used to
00:06:14 go from one place to another on the island
00:06:16 within it there is even a ferry to
00:06:18 make a boat from one town to another a boat
00:06:20 that allows you to go to other places and
00:06:23 sometimes it goes further  fast
00:06:24 in 26 css by bus
00:06:28 how are the beaches or are there beaches it
00:06:32 is not the most beautiful place for beaches not the
00:06:34 most beautiful fuerteventura there are paradisiacal beaches made
00:06:37 of cardboard height is the other
00:06:39 island
00:06:41 there is surfing and there the beaches are
00:06:44 very beautiful and not here  It is not the
00:06:47 most beautiful place for beaches because there are some
00:06:49 beautiful ones but not the most beautiful is the
00:06:52 forests in the center of the island the forest
00:06:54 that is up on the mountain if
00:06:57 the island is a volcanic island and the
00:06:59 center of the island  it is forest because the
00:07:02 canaries are volcanic they were formed
00:07:04 by volcanoes no yes that is why in many
00:07:07 places the ground or the beach is black it
00:07:09 is black from the type of rock of the
00:07:12 volcano
00:07:14 and in the canaries on la gomera there is some
00:07:20 kind of good traditional food  part
00:07:23 d  e the traditional food of all the
00:07:25 canaries here in la gomera what there
00:07:27 was was a fish that is called the old one the
00:07:30 old old one a fish but it is not an
00:07:32 old person no it is not a fish
00:07:34 called the old one a type a type of
00:07:36 fish yes  It is not a type
00:07:39 of cooking, it is a fish that they call the old
00:07:43 innovation in different ways and it
00:07:45 is only eaten, and I have only seen it there,
00:07:49 but it may be that on some low
00:07:51 island it is also eaten, but it is typical to
00:07:53 eat this fish, the old  and the old one in the
00:07:56 goma de la gomera and how they cook it
00:07:59 on the grill with accompanied by the grill
00:08:01 like a barbecue
00:08:05 for example salad and it was good it
00:08:08 was very good
00:08:12 because I know something about the
00:08:16 gomera something that catches my attention
00:08:18 that  It interests me a lot and it's the Gomero
00:08:22 whistle, not the Gomero whistle, it's a way
00:08:25 of speaking Spanish,
00:08:27 but whistling,
00:08:30 not whistling, you can communicate, you can
00:08:32 speak, say words in Spanish, you
00:08:35 heard it around the island, someone used it, well,
00:08:38 you couldn't  Because no no I didn't hear it and we
00:08:43 asked him in a small town we
00:08:44 asked a lady if they
00:08:47 used it and she told us that the man
00:08:50 who taught it in the town had
00:08:52 died and it's good that they didn't know if he was going to
00:08:55 continue or not  Okay, it was used in the
00:08:58 past for shepherds and they used it in
00:09:00 the past but now many people do
00:09:04 n't know it anymore or didn't manage to use everything they
00:09:06 teach but in school they teach it
00:09:09 but in practice I don't know I didn't get to
00:09:12 hear it well  what a pity but I think that
00:09:16 at some point I will go and read La Gomera I will
00:09:19 try to go and learn the Gomeran whistle I
00:09:21 recommend it although you will have to
00:09:23 drive through a few curves it is
00:09:26 good no problem I like driving in
00:09:29 the mountains well you
00:09:32 have to go  be careful I don't like to
00:09:34 drive through the city through the city I
00:09:37 'm afraid that between the cars
00:09:39 a child will come out and the other
00:09:42 good thing well thank you very
00:09:44 much you're welcome thank you for telling us about your experience in
00:09:47 the humidity
00:09:49 and well I think you'll soon have yourself
00:09:51 come back  go to spain yes but yes
00:09:55 but we do have another opportunity because
00:09:58 maybe in the future we can record more
00:10:00 videos tell me if you liked these

00:00:56 first the catholic kings in
00:01:04 1492 finished the reconquest they did not
00:01:11 finish conquering spain
00:01:14 and in 1492 in spain spain there were four
00:01:22 kingdoms if there was a bar there was the kingdom
00:01:30 Granada was from Aragon
00:01:33 and there was Castilla y León
00:01:36 because Isabella the first was from Castilla and
00:01:40 León and Fernando the second was from Aragon.
00:01:45 Isabel and Fernando got married so so so
00:01:50 they got married and united their forces they got
00:01:55 together and fought against the kingdom of
00:01:59 Granada Granada was a kingdom  Muslims
00:02:03 were the Muslims and they fought against
00:02:07 them and they won yes
00:02:11 and with this the reconquest ended in 1492
00:02:18 so at this time Spain were three
00:02:23 kingdoms  s 33 kingdoms
00:02:29 were three kingdoms castile and aragon
00:02:33 were united but the governments the
00:02:37 governments and the laws remained
00:02:40 separate they continued to be separate and
00:02:44 later after isabel
00:02:48 died when isabel died not
00:02:51 after ferdinand the second invaded
00:02:56 navarra also invaded navarra navarra
00:03:00 passed  to be part of aragon of the kingdom of
00:03:04 aragon yes also the catholic kings
00:03:09 began to conquer parts of italy
00:03:14 some parts of italy and north
00:03:18 africa north africa of italy and
00:03:21 of course america yes but the
00:03:25 conquest of america i will leave it for another
00:03:29 video I will talk about the conquest of
00:03:31 America in another video
00:03:34 and at this time in the 15th century 15th
00:03:40 century 16th century yes Spain and France no Spain and
00:03:47 France were not very friends they did not
00:03:51 get along no they did not get along yes and
00:03:57 the Catholic kings their  sons their sons
00:04:01 and their daughters married them married
00:04:06 princes and princesses from other European countries
00:04:12 married them to the children of the kings
00:04:15 of other countries for  To make alliances to
00:04:20 make alliances with the other countries, they were
00:04:23 married to the princes and princesses of
00:04:26 Portugal, England, Austria,
00:04:32 to unite, to unite against France,
00:04:36 against France,
00:04:39 but a well-known fact, a well-known fact
00:04:43 about the Catholic kings, was
00:04:48 the expulsion of  the jews
00:04:53 the jews the jews the expulsion of
00:04:59 the jews from spain and the expulsion of
00:05:03 the jews was the same year in 1492 the
00:05:09 same year that the reconquest ended and they
00:05:14 expelled the jews who did not want to
00:05:18 convert to christianity to
00:05:22 christianity not the jews who  They
00:05:27 converted to Christianity, there was no
00:05:30 problem, they could stay in Spain, but
00:05:34 the Jews who did not want to
00:05:37 convert had to leave, they had to
00:05:41 leave and leave Spain,
00:05:44 and this was not something new, it was not new, no,
00:05:48 they had tried to
00:05:51 convert before.  the Jews and about 100 years
00:05:56 before 100 years before at the end of
00:06:00 the 1300s there had been massacres of
00:06:06 Jews many Jews had been killed and
00:06:10 also  Many Jews had already left
00:06:13 they had left Spain
00:06:16 and in 1492 there were more or less a quarter a
00:06:24 quarter of the Jews that there were 100 years ago
00:06:28 that there were 100 years before
00:06:31 about 150,000 people 150,000 people
00:06:36 150,000 Jews and the
00:06:41 reason  the reason for expelling the
00:06:45 Jews was the influence of
00:06:49 the church the catholic church not the influence of
00:06:53 the church the influence of the
00:06:56 inquisition
00:06:58 [Music]
00:07:03 the inquisition is
00:07:07 an ecclesiastical court a church court
00:07:11 they are not judges
00:07:14 church judges  and a few years before a few years
00:07:19 before 1492 the inquisition had been
00:07:24 formed and the inquisition was formed to
00:07:27 punish the converted Jews the
00:07:32 Jews who had converted to
00:07:34 Christianity
00:07:36 or who said they said they had
00:07:40 converted but at home they continued to
00:07:43 practice Christianity  Judaism continued to
00:07:47 practice their traditions and the
00:07:50 inquisition was dedicated to
00:07:53 punishing these people, well, punishing
00:07:56 and killing them many times and because
00:08:01 since  e long ago there was a lot of violence
00:08:04 against the Jews the Catholic kings
00:08:07 had protected them they had protected
00:08:11 the Jews but in 1492 they
00:08:18 decided they were not going to protect them anymore they were
00:08:21 not going to kick them out and in 1492 they signed they
00:08:29 signed a law they signed the law not the
00:08:33 law
00:08:36 the law to expel the Jews and the
00:08:40 Jews could leave but from Spain it
00:08:46 was forbidden it was forbidden to
00:08:50 take gold to take out horses it was
00:08:55 forbidden forbidden you couldn't
00:08:58 that's why the Jews the Jews who
00:09:01 sold their house received very little
00:09:05 money they received few things  in exchange
00:09:08 for their houses and the richest those who
00:09:12 had more money
00:09:16 converted to christianity but
00:09:19 most of the jews left
00:09:23 left and many went to live in turkey
00:09:26 to turkey to other parts of europe or
00:09:30 africa
00:09:32 and after a few years  later in 1502
00:09:45 Muslims were forced Muslims were forced to convert to
00:09:50 Christianity yes yes Muslims
00:09:54 had no choice to leave no p  they hated to leave
00:09:57 no no in 1502 they could not leave but
00:10:03 later in 1609 in 1609 they were no longer the
00:10:10 catholic kings
00:10:11 no no in 1609 the muslims who
00:10:16 had converted to christianity
00:10:20 had not converted but still there were
00:10:23 many people who did not like them  They did
00:10:27 n't like Muslim converts, no,
00:10:30 and in 1609 they were kicked out, they were people in
00:10:36 Spain, Catholics because they
00:10:39 had converted, they were
00:10:41 kicked out in 1609,
00:10:45 you knew that they had
00:10:49 kicked out the Muslims, I didn't
00:10:52 know or I didn't remember in the next
00:10:56 Video I will tell you about the colonization of
00:11:00 America, the colonization of America
00:11:03 and other places by the Spanish empire,
00:11:06 okay, come see you later,
00:11:22 there was no problem,
00:11:27 there was no problem.

239,"00:00:00 Today I am going to tell you why I don't like
00:00:03 Duolingo at all because I would never use it
00:00:07 to learn a language and because I
00:00:10 would never recommend it to anyone unless they
00:00:14 have no other option, no other
00:00:18 way to learn the language
00:00:23 [Music]
00:00:26 so today I'm going  I am only going to talk
00:00:29 about the application and the duolingo website,
00:00:33 the application and the main website, I
00:00:37 am not going to talk about the duolingo podcasts, the
00:00:40 duolingo stories, or other
00:00:44 possible products that edu or link or the
00:00:47 duolingo company can release in the
00:00:50 future ok so today I'm not going to
00:00:53 complain about the typical things
00:00:56 that people complain about I see a lot of people
00:00:59 complain about maybe three things about
00:01:03 duolingo one is that I didn't explain the grammar
00:01:06 well with our method with
00:01:08 understandable input we don't need
00:01:10 explanations of  grammar another is that
00:01:13 when it tells you something is wrong I didn't
00:01:16 explain why it's wrong in input it's
00:01:19 understandable we don't use comprehension and
00:01:22 corrections we avoid corrections
00:01:25 so that's not a  The third problem
00:01:28 people complain about is that the phrases don't
00:01:31 make sense, that there are phrases like no,
00:01:34 we don't sell planes to elephants, well,
00:01:38 you'll never use that specific phrase in
00:01:43 real life, but learning a language is not
00:01:46 about learning specific phrases
00:01:49 that you're going to repeat later.  It's not just
00:01:52 learning the patterns of the language, it's
00:01:55 learning the words, how to use them in
00:01:58 a sentence and learning to build sentences,
00:02:01 so I don't think that's a problem either.
00:02:05 Today I'm going to talk about the
00:02:08 real problems of why Duolingo
00:02:12 is a good tool to help
00:02:15 acquire  languages ​​so first I'm going to
00:02:19 talk about specific types of exercises
00:02:22 because it had a link or they are
00:02:25 duolingo exercises at no time does duolingo
00:02:28 teach you duolingo it's like a very
00:02:31 long exam that exam exam exam exam
00:02:33 exam okay so to answer an
00:02:37 exam there are exercises and I'm going to talk about
00:02:39 specific types of
00:02:42 exercises perhaps the most typical exercise I
00:02:44 think is the most common in duolingo is gives you
00:02:48 words  flush and you have to order them you have
00:02:51 to put them in the specific order that
00:02:54 is of no use at any time in
00:02:57 real life they give you a series of words and
00:03:00 you have to place them no never that is it
00:03:04 is not completely
00:03:06 disconnected from the actual uses of the
00:03:10 language other  type of exercise is choose
00:03:13 the image choose the image of a girl
00:03:15 but they tell you that is if you are
00:03:18 learning Spanish from English to
00:03:20 Spanish they tell you in English they tell you
00:03:23 choose a girl and there are the words
00:03:26 in Spanish but above the word there is
00:03:29 a  I draw so you don't have to know
00:03:32 the word but hey this is only at the
00:03:35 beginning it's only the first levels
00:03:37 maybe it's a way to okay okay I've
00:03:41 seen that word I've already seen it without
00:03:44 having to fail without making you already fail to
00:03:46 do it wrong from the beginning  no other
00:03:49 exercise is choose the correct option
00:03:52 choose the correct option among three
00:03:54 phrases among three meanings I can't
00:03:58 choose the correct phrase by
00:04:00 elimination just because I know that the others
00:04:03 two are not only because I see a
00:04:05 word that I say good but in the
00:04:08 first sentence there is an elephant and in the
00:04:11 sentence in Spanish there is no elephant
00:04:14 therefore this is not this it is not good because it
00:04:16 is this I understand the sentence I do not understand
00:04:20 most of  words in the sentence no but
00:04:23 I am very good at answering
00:04:26 tests no and then there is the exercise of
00:04:29 completing the conversation that you have to
00:04:33 fill in a space in the conversation
00:04:35 not here anyway you don't have to understand
00:04:39 most of the things only  knowing
00:04:42 a word with understanding a word
00:04:45 is enough to know what to answer
00:04:48 and not even talking about when they make you
00:04:52 write a word but the word is
00:04:54 exactly the same
00:04:56 for example hospital and they make you write
00:04:59 hospital in Spanish and it's okay to
00:05:02 copy-paste then  This is already bad
00:05:05 because they make you do exercises that
00:05:08 are completely disconnected from
00:05:10 real life that have nothing to do with
00:05:13 practical applications of the language and that
00:05:16 you can answer without realm  If you
00:05:19 know the language well you can answer you are
00:05:22 learning to answer exams you
00:05:25 are not learning to use the language but
00:05:28 there is a bigger problem there is a
00:05:30 more important problem with duolingo and that is the
00:05:33 reason why I wanted to record this
00:05:37 video today and this problem affects these
00:05:39 guys  of exercises but it affects all
00:05:43 the types of exercises to all the
00:05:45 other types also of edu or lingo and the
00:05:49 problem is the lack of context
00:05:52 duolingo says well we give you sentences in
00:05:57 the words they are in a sentence there are
00:05:59 several words there is a whole sentence
00:06:02 so  so much you have context you have the
00:06:04 context of the non-bone sentence that is
00:06:08 a lousy context a very very poor context there
00:06:11 is very little context in real life
00:06:14 in any situation we have
00:06:16 much more much more context a
00:06:20 sentence who has said it to who has
00:06:23 said it  because it has been said within
00:06:27 what conversation has this sentence been said
00:06:30 the relationship between the two people
00:06:34 these two people where are they when
00:06:37 they said it in what  moment what time of the
00:06:40 day what day of the week with what
00:06:42 intention because this person has
00:06:45 said this thing to the other all this
00:06:47 context in what tones he said what
00:06:50 intonation he used when saying it
00:06:53 all this we don't have any of this in
00:06:56 duolingo so this  It can be seen very
00:06:59 clearly when you have to translate
00:07:01 sentences when Duolingo asks you to
00:07:04 translate a sentence ok so in this
00:07:08 example it shows us the sentence she is
00:07:11 a girl which means the sentence
00:07:14 she is a girl maybe it will
00:07:17 seem very simple maybe you will  it will seem like it can
00:07:20 be translated very easily no the
00:07:23 meaning of she is a girl
00:07:25 depends a lot depends on who
00:07:29 is saying it from where she is from what is the
00:07:32 more general context in which she
00:07:34 said it to really know what the
00:07:37 meaning is what the connotations are
00:07:40 This phrase that she is saying that perhaps
00:07:42 seems silly to you but it is not
00:07:46 because she is a girl is a phrase that
00:07:50 the natives will almost never say that they
00:07:54 almost never go to us  ar and I have been
00:07:56 thinking about it a lot I have been thinking about how
00:07:59 the situation would have to be
00:08:02 for someone to say this sentence and it is very
00:08:06 difficult because you are learning a
00:08:08 sentence and you can think well whenever
00:08:12 you have to specify what to say if
00:08:14 a person is a child or  girl can use
00:08:17 this phrase no no they will not understand you for
00:08:20 sure but in Spanish we don't
00:08:23 say it that way it is not said that way maybe you can
00:08:26 imagine well I can say she is
00:08:29 a girl when maybe I have a baby I
00:08:33 don't have a baby
00:08:35 someone asks me or is  boy or
00:08:38 girl, well, you wouldn't say she's a girl,
00:08:41 you would simply say she's a girl, because they
00:08:45 only asked you if it's a girl or if it's a boy, it
00:08:47 's a girl, that's it, I'd never do it, it's the whole sentence,
00:08:50 she's a girl, because if it's
00:08:53 her, it's a girl and that's it  We know that it is a
00:08:56 very strange sound. Another example, maybe you
00:09:00 think that you can use it when
00:09:03 a new student has entered the class,
00:09:06 there is a new person in the class and they ask you,
00:09:09 is it a boy or a
00:09:13 girl?  ón you would not say she is
00:09:16 a girl either you would say it is a girl
00:09:20 because she is a pronoun that
00:09:23 refers to something you already know
00:09:26 someone you have already talked about not
00:09:28 only that a person you already know
00:09:31 is feminine that is feminine
00:09:34 that she is a woman a girl therefore
00:09:36 you would not say she if you still did not know
00:09:40 who that person was you still did not
00:09:43 know that she was a girl would you say she is a
00:09:46 girl then really when this phrase would be used
00:09:49 well in the sentence it is said
00:09:52 she is so we are talking  of
00:09:55 her therefore both the person who says it
00:09:57 and the other know that there is a person and
00:10:01 that this person is female,
00:10:04 so supposedly the phrase she is
00:10:07 a girl we are giving information
00:10:09 we are informing the other person
00:10:12 that she is a girl  but since we both already
00:10:14 know that it is female,
00:10:17 we are informing that it is a
00:10:20 young woman, we are informing the
00:10:23 other person of the person's age in general,
00:10:26 so if we are  Using the
00:10:29 word she is because we need to
00:10:32 distinguish between her and some other
00:10:35 person that is not her some other
00:10:36 person that we already know is not
00:10:40 female we know that there are at least
00:10:42 two people and that we already know that one
00:10:45 is female and  the other one is okay then
00:10:48 it means that at some point
00:10:51 we have already talked about her that we had
00:10:53 referred to her sex or that we already know
00:10:55 for some reason but we did not know the
00:10:59 age of this person so the only
00:11:01 situations that occur to me are two
00:11:05 people who  they are perhaps looking at a
00:11:07 list of names and in the list of
00:11:10 names they see male
00:11:12 names female names and perhaps one of the
00:11:15 observers points to a name and says
00:11:18 she is a girl because he already knows it
00:11:21 because he knows the name he knows this
00:11:23 person and the other  He has already seen that it is a
00:11:26 female name, therefore he already knows that it
00:11:28 is her but he still does not know the age and
00:11:31 the two of them, one person has to inform
00:11:34 the other because they are looking for a
00:11:37 person of  At a young age, a person, well,
00:11:40 young, not a boy or a girl, so
00:11:42 we also know that this phrase cannot
00:11:45 be an answer to a question, the
00:11:48 way it is written, it must be
00:11:50 that the person who has seen the name on
00:11:52 the list,
00:11:53 the mind is telling him  informing the
00:11:57 other person of something that you know is not
00:11:59 an answer to a question and you are
00:12:02 giving this information so that the
00:12:04 other person is safely informed
00:12:07 so that they make a decision so that they
00:12:09 decide something because the person who has
00:12:11 seen the name has not made  Now the
00:12:13 decision, if I hadn't said something
00:12:15 completely different, then you can see
00:12:18 that this phrase, this phrase that seems
00:12:20 simple, is giving a lot of information and
00:12:24 is limiting a lot in which cases it
00:12:26 can be used and in which cases it cannot be
00:12:28 used, and all this is very different from  the
00:12:32 original phrase in english the
00:12:34 original phrase could be used or not used in
00:12:37 situations very different from those
00:12:41 used in spanish and therefore would almost
00:12:43 always be a bad deal  duction but of
00:12:46 course you don't know all this when you use
00:12:49 duolingo you have no idea because you
00:12:52 don't know who is saying the sentence to
00:12:54 whom because where are they what is the
00:12:58 intention what is the result and what
00:13:03 has led to say this sentence
00:13:05 what has  happened before and what
00:13:07 happened after I said this sentence
00:13:09 and all this makes you unable to
00:13:13 learn most of the meaning of each
00:13:16 word duolingo is not telling you
00:13:18 anything about whether it is appropriate to use any
00:13:22 of the words it teaches you if it is
00:13:25 appropriate to use it in an informal context
00:13:28 or in a formal context if the word is
00:13:30 offensive or if it is not offensive and does not
00:13:34 explain all the ranges of use of a
00:13:36 word the full range of
00:13:38 meanings that a word can have
00:13:41 that the Spanish word can cover
00:13:44 such a zone of meanings but the
00:13:48 English word is perhaps such a zone
00:13:51 that they cover a bit in some cases they
00:13:54 have the same meaning but in
00:13:56 many sentences in many situations the
00:13:59 meanings  They will be different, for
00:14:01 example, the word that we have seen before
00:14:04 in English in most situations
00:14:07 is not the best word to translate
00:14:10 girl, it is not the word that comes closest to
00:14:13 the meaning and this makes the
00:14:16 translation very confusing. I would say that
00:14:19 the translations are always confusing.  a lot
00:14:22 because the situations in which
00:14:25 you would use each phrase and the word in the
00:14:28 two languages ​​can be very different and
00:14:31 this is what I consider the
00:14:34 main problem of duolingo which is the lack of
00:14:38 context and the problems with
00:14:40 doing translations and this coupled with  the
00:14:43 problems of the exercises that you are
00:14:45 learning to answer exams and not
00:14:48 learning the language I think are the
00:14:51 main problems of tube lingo and
00:14:53 the reasons why I do not use it nor
00:14:56 will I use it and I do not recommend that other
00:14:59 people use it unless they  there really is
00:15:02 n't any other resource to
00:15:05 learn that language and we'll see you in the

00:00:04 period of time in which the
00:00:08 Iberian Peninsula' the Iberian Peninsula was part
00:00:13 of the Roman Empire
00:00:16 and things things that the Romans did
00:00:20 that the Romans built that
00:00:24 we still have that we still use now
00:00:28 yes
00:00:30 [Music]
00:00:35 hello  Well, in the previous episode it is
00:00:40 explained how in the Iberian Peninsula
00:00:44 there were several tribes there were tribes and there
00:00:49 were the Iberians and there were the Celts
00:00:54 and the Greeks came and the Phoenicians came
00:01:01 and in the 2nd century in the 2nd century before
00:01:07 Christ the 2nd century before  Christ are
00:01:12 the years
00:01:15 no less than one hundred and something in the second
00:01:20 century before Christ the Romans came
00:01:24 the Romans were not in Italy they were
00:01:30 in Rome' they came they came to the
00:01:34 Iberian Peninsula and first they
00:01:38 found the Iberians and the Iberians
00:01:42 didn't care much  the romans
00:01:46 conquered they conquered a part of
00:01:49 the peninsula but there were places on the
00:01:53 peninsula where there was resistance the
00:01:57 romans
00:01:57 met
00:01:59 resistance there was an area  Between
00:02:04 the Iberians and the Celts, where
00:02:08 the Celtiberians were, the Celtiberians were a
00:02:13 mixture, a mixture of cultures, a
00:02:18 mixture of Iberian culture and Celtic culture,
00:02:21 and the Celtiberians put up resistance
00:02:26 to the Romans invading them, to the
00:02:29 Romans invading the territory, and there were
00:02:34 three  wars there were three great wars
00:02:36 between the celtiberians and the romans and
00:02:40 there were also other wars with other
00:02:43 tribes other tribes of the
00:02:46 iberian peninsula and finally finally in the
00:02:51 year 19 the year 19 also before christ
00:02:57 that is -19 was when the romans
00:03:02 managed to invade  all
00:03:05 only the entire Iberian peninsula belonged
00:03:09 to the Romans and the peninsula the
00:03:16 Romans called it Hispania or Spain they
00:03:22 called it Hispania and at this time
00:03:26 Hispania served the Romans
00:03:30 because olive oil was produced in Hispania
00:03:33 and wine was produced yes yes already in this
00:03:37 time a long time ago, more
00:03:41 than 2000 years ago
00:03:43 , wine was already made and
00:03:46 olive oil was made in Spain and also in
00:03:51 Hi  spania there was metal metal was brought to
00:03:56 rome
00:03:57 and the different tribes the people who
00:04:02 lived in hispania were changing their
00:04:06 culture their culture was adapting
00:04:09 resembling roman culture the
00:04:12 culture of the romans
00:04:14 there are some cities cities that
00:04:19 expanded became bigger
00:04:21 when they came  the romans for example
00:04:25 tarragona tarragona or in the past
00:04:29 tarraco and also the romans
00:04:34 started new cities such
00:04:37 as zaragoza
00:04:40 zaragoza mérida valencia they were
00:04:46 cities founded by the romans that did not
00:04:49 exist before and were founded by the romans of
00:04:53 course the language we speak is
00:04:56 spanish  it also evolved from Latin it
00:05:01 came it came from Latin brought by the
00:05:05 Romans
00:05:08 many most most
00:05:11 of the words of the Spanish words
00:05:13 come from Latin and the Romans also
00:05:18 had an effect another effect is that in
00:05:23 the 4th century in the 4th century
00:05:29 the 4th century is the 300s whatever
00:05:34 after christ in the 4th century the
00:05:39 empire  the roman empire changed to
00:05:42 christianity it changed to christianity and
00:05:46 that also affected hispania also all of
00:05:50 hispania changed to christianity and the
00:05:54 roman empire the roman empire in the
00:05:57 iberian peninsula' lasted until the fall
00:06:00 until the fall of the
00:06:03 western roman empire not the roman empire had  two
00:06:08 halves and the western part fell in
00:06:13 the 5th century 5th century in the years I don't know what
00:06:19 year the year 400 or so
00:06:23 the Roman Empire fell
00:06:26 yes and then the Iberian Peninsula
00:06:30 was invaded again
00:06:35 invaders came who took over the Iberian Peninsula
00:06:39 but no  it was the muslims the

00:00:37 a  sometimes sometimes when we hear music from
00:00:42 a country it
00:00:44 seems all the same when we hear it it seems
00:00:49 very the same right but in truth
00:00:54 in spain there are many different
00:00:59 types many different types of music and today
00:01:04 I am going to talk about rumba

00:01:44 [Music]
00:01:50 [Music]
00:01:53 but today today I am going to talk about the rumba
00:01:59 the rumba originates from Cuba from Cuba
00:02:05 the rumba comes from Cuba and came from Cuba to
00:02:11 Spain and this is  the Cuban rumba
00:02:16 heard heard
00:02:21 [Music]
00:02:27 but the Cuban rumba is very different it's
00:02:32 different it changed a lot when it
00:02:37 came when it came to spain
00:02:40 in the rumba in cuba- they use drums they use they
00:02:47 use drums
00:02:52 but in spain it changed  a lot and it evolved it
00:02:56 evolved into two types of rumba very
00:03:00 important is the flamenco rumba and the
00:03:04 catalan rumba
00:03:07 and they use musical instruments and
00:03:10 instruments more from Spain more from Spain he
00:03:16 doesn't use the drum he doesn't use drums he uses the

00:03:30 this cajón the catalan rumba is a
00:03:35 musical genre a type of music not a
00:03:39 style of music that develops in
00:03:43 Barcelona especially in Barcelona by the
00:03:47 gypsy community by the gypsies and it was
00:03:53 in the decade of the  60 in the 1960s 1960 and
00:04:01 in this decade was when the gypsies the
00:04:05 gypsy community of Barcelona began to
00:04:09 play Catalan rumba
00:04:11 examples of the Catalan rumba are Pérez

00:04:23 is the rumba of the pod
00:04:27 and also Gato Pérez del Sabor
00:04:34 and that life in the mirror of  feel
00:04:37 multicolored

201,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about the Bourbon restoration
00:00:06 of the return of the kings the kings the
00:00:11 royal family the bourbons
00:00:14 returned to Spain there was a time a
00:00:19 time when there was a republic there
00:00:22 were no kings the kings returned and there was a
00:00:26 time a time when  the
00:00:31 government stabilized
00:00:35 a calm was achieved a calm
00:00:39 that we had not had for a long time
00:00:43 ah
00:00:44 [Music]
00:00:47 hello well yes today we will talk about the period
00:00:54 between
00:00:56 1875 and
00:00:59 1902 yes we finally finally reached the
00:01:04 20th century to the 20th century yes and in the
00:01:09 previous video  or it was explained that we returned to
00:01:14 the monarchy we once again had a king with
00:01:19 alfonso 12 that alfonso 12 was the son of
00:01:23 isabel segunda isabel segunda her son
00:01:28 was alfonso 12 no then before
00:01:33 alfonso 12 there was the first republic of
00:01:37 spain a government without a king no  it had
00:01:41 kings but in the end the
00:01:45 situation was very unstable there was a
00:01:49 coup d'état in pavía
00:01:52 coup d'état in pavía and so at
00:01:56 this time many people wanted
00:02:00 a king to return they wanted to have them again  be
00:02:03 king and if alfonso 12 will be king from
00:02:08 1875 to
00:02:13 1885 and in
00:02:17 1885 when
00:02:20 alfonso 12 died he had no sons he
00:02:25 had no sons who were sons he did
00:02:29 have daughters but he had no sons
00:02:32 but the queen in
00:02:35 1885 the queen was pregnant she
00:02:39 was  pregnant and after
00:02:44 alfonso 12 died her son was born
00:02:49 her son who would also be king who will be
00:02:53 alfonso 13 then well we
00:02:58 will return we will return here but for now we are going to
00:03:02 talk about how the government was during
00:03:05 these years and the person who thought of this
00:03:11 restoration who thought
00:03:20 Cánovas del Castillo was the one
00:03:30 who designed the
00:03:38 Return of the Kings.
00:03:41 many problems and I did not want to return to
00:03:45 these problems the problems between the
00:03:48 right and the left no then
00:03:51 cánovas del castillo created two
00:03:55 political parties  s the conservative party and the
00:03:59 party
00:04:01 and they create a constitution a new
00:04:05 constitution the constitution of
00:04:08 1876 that lasted for a long time lasted
00:04:13 until
00:04:16 1931 then what he wanted was to
00:04:21 prevent coups d'état to prevent
00:04:25 the military from carrying out coups d'état
00:04:29 as had happened so many times  times before
00:04:32 then their system was turnismo it was
00:04:37 that the conservatives and the liberals
00:04:41 took turns
00:04:44 they kept changing the power of the
00:04:48 government although in truth the population
00:04:51 was allowed to vote the people were
00:04:55 going to vote but if when the people
00:04:59 the government voted they did not
00:05:01 change the votes were manipulated the
00:05:05 votes were manipulated the elections
00:05:08 that the government was changing and all
00:05:12 the people in power
00:05:14 were happy
00:05:17 then this was possible because the two
00:05:22 parties did have some
00:05:25 ideas in common some ideas that were
00:05:28 equals agreed to have a
00:05:32 monarchy to have a king or queen
00:05:35 agreed to  have
00:05:38 private property in which people could
00:05:41 have land they could have money or
00:05:44 have companies they agreed to
00:05:47 have a constitution
00:05:49 they agreed to have a
00:05:53 unitary state in which the entire country of spain
00:05:56 was controlled from a single place from
00:06:01 a single government
00:06:02 although good  there were still people
00:06:06 who did not agree, for example
00:06:09 the Carlists, the people who still
00:06:12 thought that this queen and this king
00:06:15 were not correct, also the
00:06:18 republican people, the people who did not want to have a
00:06:22 king or queen, did not want to have a
00:06:24 monarchy and, well, also the classes
00:06:27 the working classes with less with less
00:06:30 money than normally, well, they are a
00:06:34 bit out of what the politicians want,
00:06:37 no, and well, the truth is that
00:06:41 this system
00:06:42 worked quite well until
00:06:47 1898 until
00:06:49 1898 it was quite well then
00:06:54 cánovas del castillo was the leader of the
00:06:57 conservatives
00:06:58 and then sagasta sagasta was the leader of
00:07:03 the liberals and they alternated
00:07:07 in power
00:07:08 can  ovas del castillo and sagasta and well
00:07:11 the system continued until 1898 but in
00:07:17 this time from 75 to 98
00:07:22 some things did happen in 75 they
00:07:26 were still fighting the
00:07:28 third carlist war the carlists
00:07:31 who wanted another king still
00:07:35 travel they kept thinking they wanted another
00:07:39 king he was  and the third war and again they
00:07:42 lost as always the Carlists
00:07:45 lost then in
00:07:48 1878
00:07:50 1878 was the war in cuba a war was fought
00:07:55 in cuba in which
00:07:58 spain lost spain lost the war but hey
00:08:02 we will talk about this in another in another video and
00:08:05 then in
00:08:07 1885 the king dies then when the
00:08:12 king dies his wife was
00:08:15 pregnant his son was born and when his
00:08:18 son was born they immediately made him
00:08:21 king they said you are the king but of course the
00:08:24 king was a minor the king was a baby
00:08:27 and then at that  At the moment they
00:08:30 made his wife the network
00:08:34 his wife was the queen regent his wife
00:08:38 María Cristina yes María Cristina but she is
00:08:43 another Maria Cristina we already saw a Maria
00:08:47 Cristina in the 1st century  9 At the beginning of the
00:08:52 19th century this was another Maria
00:08:56 Cristina and Maria Cristina was there
00:08:59 from 1985 to
00:09:02 1902 and one important thing is that in
00:09:07 1890 universal suffrage was approved, what
00:09:12 they called universal suffrage at that
00:09:15 time, suffrage means voting
00:09:18 voting in the elections  That the people
00:09:21 could choose who was going to be the
00:09:23 government, not even though they
00:09:26 weren't real elections, it
00:09:29 was rigged, it was rigged, and at that
00:09:32 time they called it universal suffrage,
00:09:35 but in truth,
00:09:37 we would call it universal male suffrage
00:09:41 because women couldn't
00:09:46 vote, it was only  men but if it
00:09:49 was much broader than before
00:09:53 only a
00:09:57 very small percentage of men could vote and
00:10:00 now at least it was all
00:10:04 men then this system had a
00:10:08 problem and that is that each party depended a
00:10:12 lot on its leader each party
00:10:16 basically  represented the image
00:10:19 of cánovas del castillo and sagasta
00:10:23 then something happened and  n
00:10:26 [Music]
00:10:28 1897 a man an italian anarchist a
00:10:34 man from italy who was an anarchist who
00:10:37 did not want any form of government
00:10:41 killed cánovas del castillo lolo murderer and
00:10:46 then instability was created in the conservative party
00:10:50 none of his successors
00:10:53 none of the people he wanted  being
00:10:57 the next leader was
00:10:59 good enough he had
00:11:02 enough friends within the party
00:11:06 enough people who believed in him
00:11:09 within the party and in
00:11:12 [Music]
00:11:13 1903 sagasta sick he got sick and
00:11:18 also died and the liberal party
00:11:22 had the same problem if also in
00:11:28 1898 Spain loses its last
00:11:33 territories in America it is the disaster
00:11:37 of 98 and well I will talk more about this in
00:11:43 the next video I will tell you exactly what
00:11:46 happened but hey Spain there was a war
00:11:49 in America and Spain lost so this
00:11:54 was the disaster of 98 so this was
00:11:59 bad for the economy of spain and
00:12:02 it was also bad for the image of
00:12:05 spain globally spain stopped being
00:12:10 a world power  ial and if what happened
00:12:14 here hurt the pride of many
00:12:19 people and this caused a
00:12:23 movement known as
00:12:26 regenerationism to begin and regenerationism
00:12:29 sought to improve Spain improve
00:12:34 people's education
00:12:36 trying to improve the economy and
00:12:40 good in the future in  We will see another video we will
00:12:43 see what happened to this system that
00:12:47 was ending
00:12:49 earlier in the next video we will see what
00:12:53 happened in America
00:12:55 we will see what happened in the war in Cuba
00:12:59 the war between the US and Spain
00:13:03 tell me who you support

005,"00:00:00 Today we are going to talk about the differences
00:00:04 between elections and voting in
00:00:09 Spain and the US because although
00:00:15 there is democracy in both and in both there is a
00:00:19 figure called the president, there
00:00:23 are still many differences and even the
00:00:26 president of Spain has
00:00:30 different functions  of the president of the usa and today
00:00:35 we are going to talk about those differences
00:00:40 [Music]
00:00:44 hello well yes today we are going to talk about the
00:00:48 national elections of the elections
00:00:52 at the national level the elections of the country
00:00:57 we are not going to talk about
00:01:00 regional elections or local elections that
00:01:04 there are also no  in spain we
00:01:07 have autonomous communities we have madrid
00:01:11 catalonia galicia andalusia there are several
00:01:15 autonomous communities and in these there
00:01:19 are also votes and then in each municipality
00:01:22 in each town or city there are also
00:01:26 votes but today we are not going to talk about
00:01:29 these we are going to talk about the
00:01:32 national elections the elections  for the
00:01:35 government of the country and we are also going to compare
00:01:40 them with the elections in the USA, the
00:01:44 elections that  and they are presidential and from
00:01:48 congress that we are also going to see that in
00:01:51 Spain it works differently
00:01:55 and the first difference is the date the
00:01:59 day they are made in the US there is a
00:02:03 fixed day it is always a Tuesday it has to
00:02:08 be a Tuesday and it is always  the first
00:02:12 week of november in november the
00:02:15 first week
00:02:17 is decided anyway when it's the first
00:02:20 week and then it's Tuesday no
00:02:25 and this in spain is different in spain
00:02:30 the voting is on sunday it's always
00:02:34 done on sunday because there are
00:02:36 more people on sunday  who has a party that they can go
00:02:40 to vote because in the US it's a Tuesday
00:02:44 and it's not a party it's not a national holiday a
00:02:49 lot of people have to go to work that day
00:02:53 okay then if in Spain it's a Sunday
00:03:01 but there is no fixed date you don't have to  be
00:03:05 certain Sunday specifically and it is not
00:03:09 the same day every year
00:03:12 it is not even the same month it does not
00:03:15 have to be the same month as it is in
00:03:19 Spain
00:03:20 in Spain the national elections
00:03:24 are also every four years as e  In the
00:03:27 USA, not in the USA,
00:03:30 they vote for the president every four
00:03:34 years in Spain, the maximum is four years,
00:03:39 it cannot be more than four years since
00:03:43 the last elections. I don't know if there are
00:03:46 any exceptions.
00:03:53 every four years that passes that the
00:03:57 elections can be advanced if for
00:04:00 any reason the government decides that it
00:04:03 wants to advance the elections or because they
00:04:06 are in a situation in which the
00:04:09 government does not work, it cannot decide
00:04:12 anything or because they think that if they hold the
00:04:17 elections sooner they will  to get more
00:04:20 votes than if they hold the elections
00:04:24 later because the government
00:04:26 to advance can hold
00:04:29 early elections that we say and you can vote
00:04:33 before and that is why there is no fixed date and it
00:04:36 can be different for each vote
00:04:39 but well if it is always every four
00:04:43 years  or less then another difference in the
00:04:49 usa you vote for congress you vote that
00:04:54 I don't know if which party or which members
00:04:57 you want to enter congress and
00:05:00 then you leave  You vote for the president in
00:05:03 separate elections you vote for congress
00:05:07 every two years and for the president every 4 years
00:05:12 in spain it's only one vote you only
00:05:16 vote for the members of congress you
00:05:19 vote for who you want it to be you vote for one
00:05:23 party only you only vote for the
00:05:26 party the party that has  More than
00:05:30 you have removed more members of the congress
00:05:33 because then in the congress they will have more
00:05:36 power to vote and once
00:05:40 the members of the congress are decided then the
00:05:44 congress votes who they want to be the
00:05:47 president that congress has to
00:05:50 choose the president if there is a party
00:05:53 that has  more than half of the congress
00:05:56 then they choose the president and
00:06:00 normally it is already known
00:06:02 normally there is a person who is the
00:06:06 leader
00:06:07 if the leader of the party would be said to be
00:06:10 the one who is going to be chosen as president
00:06:13 but without any party he gets more
00:06:18 than half  of the votes because the parties
00:06:21 have to ally themselves they have to make
00:06:24 agreements with other parties to
00:06:28 help them vote to choose a president
00:06:31 not e  So it is the Congress that chooses
00:06:34 the next president, we do not
00:06:39 vote for him directly, now he is called the
00:06:43 president in Spain and the one from the US is
00:06:46 also called president, but in
00:06:49 truth, his functions are the figure of the
00:06:53 president of Spain, he is really like
00:06:57 a prime minister, he is like the  prime
00:06:59 minister of other countries is more similar
00:07:02 to the functions of a prime minister and
00:07:05 not to those of a president of the
00:07:08 republic
00:07:09 and not only that in the usa there are not two but
00:07:13 three the president is not voted for the house
00:07:18 of representatives and the senate in spain
00:07:22 We also do not vote for the House of Representatives
00:07:25 and the Senate separately. We do not
00:07:29 vote for the Congress, no lie. In
00:07:33 Spain, we also have two, we have the
00:07:36 Congress and the Senate, they are
00:07:39 separate votes, but the Congress is chosen
00:07:44 only by the voters, the more people
00:07:48 vote for a party, well, the
00:07:51 more  there will be more seats, more representatives
00:07:55 from that party in congress,
00:07:58 so when we vote we choose the
00:08:03 deputies from our province  start in spain
00:08:07 there are several provinces there are the provinces
00:08:11 are equal to or smaller than the
00:08:15 autonomous communities
00:08:16 for example in catalonia we have 44
00:08:21 provinces we have tarragona lleida
00:08:24 girona and barcelona some communities
00:08:29 like madrid have only one
00:08:32 province so each province is worth
00:08:38 depending on the population of how many
00:08:41 people  vivan can choose between 2
00:08:46 37 deputies 2 and 37 representatives in
00:08:52 congress this is for congress and
00:08:55 we vote for congress then the
00:08:58 senate the senate is a little different and
00:09:02 for the senate when we vote
00:09:06 each province each province chooses
00:09:10 up to four senators four  people
00:09:14 for the senate but then the
00:09:18 autonomous communities also vote they
00:09:21 also choose more senators and here
00:09:26 it does depend on the population the
00:09:29 number of people in each
00:09:32 autonomous community is a bit complicated but
00:09:36 well the result is that both in
00:09:39 congress and in the  senate
00:09:43 the provinces the provinces with little
00:09:47 population  with few voters they are
00:09:51 overrepresented their votes affect
00:09:55 more their votes have more power more
00:09:58 influence than the votes of people in
00:10:02 places like barcelona or madrid where there is
00:10:05 a large population and of course this system
00:10:09 also causes many votes to
00:10:13 be thrown away no  be
00:10:16 taken into account if there has been a
00:10:20 vote you have two members of
00:10:23 congress and there has been a vote
00:10:27 and one party has not one party
00:10:31 has 35 percent and the other 35
00:10:37 percent because all these votes are
00:10:42 ignored they are thrown away they are not useful for  nothing
00:10:45 also has this effect if
00:10:48 party a has one million
00:10:52 one million votes and party b has
00:10:56 one million votes in a province in
00:11:01 here in a province well they will win
00:11:06 congressman a representative in
00:11:09 congress if party faith
00:11:13 has here I don't know  it has 100,000 it has
00:11:19 100,000 but then in other provinces it
00:11:21 also has 100 thousand 100 thousand 100 thousand
00:11:25 100 thousand and adding adding it reaches a
00:11:29 million
00:11:31 devotees it may be that it has no
00:11:35 rep  resenting in congress with
00:11:39 the same votes that does not have
00:11:42 anyone in congress no then well congress
00:11:46 is chosen and congress
00:11:49 then votes to choose the president
00:11:53 and this is a big difference in the usa
00:11:57 the president is voted directly no and
00:12:02 by  that in the usa before the
00:12:07 presidential elections there the primaries
00:12:12 and well the entire presidential campaign
00:12:15 and primaries lasts more or less a year that
00:12:20 for us is incredible a year of
00:12:24 political campaign campaign
00:12:27 so the primaries in the usa are very
00:12:32 complicated because in each state
00:12:35 It also works differently It is
00:12:38 difficult to explain exactly the system
00:12:42 In all the states in the USA You vote You
00:12:48 vote for nine months From the first
00:12:51 state to the last They spend nine months in
00:12:55 Spain The campaigns The electoral
00:12:59 campaign The campaign to encourage voters to
00:13:04 vote for you  it's 15 days only 15
00:13:08 days
00:13:09 if two weeks is already only that and
00:13:13 there are some things that are only
00:13:17 allowed during e  These fifteen days that
00:13:20 outside of these fifteen days are not
00:13:24 prohibited, although in practice
00:13:27 we already know that politicians
00:13:31 are always campaigning, they are always thinking
00:13:35 about what they do, how it will affect their
00:13:40 voters, how it will affect their votes in
00:13:44 the future, so in  USA when you
00:13:49 vote for the president, something similar happens
00:13:55 something similar to this:
00:13:59 if people vote for the president
00:14:03 but the president with the most votes is not chosen, the
00:14:07 most people have voted
00:14:11 in each state in each of the
00:14:14 states of the USA, the votes are added to
00:14:18 a candidate for a president and
00:14:22 a winner is chosen, the person who
00:14:25 has won in that state is chosen if
00:14:30 candidate has taken 51% and candidate of 49%
00:14:38 since this candidate takes 100%
00:14:44 takes 100% of the votes of that  been
00:14:48 here there are many votes many many
00:14:52 votes that may be being thrown
00:14:55 away that are ignored no
00:14:58 in general it seems it seems that the
00:15:02 percentage of votes the percentage of
00:15:05 votes that are ignored that are thrown away  The
00:15:08 garbage in the US is bigger than that of
00:15:13 Spain I think it seems the same as in Spain
00:15:16 the votes of the states with fewer people
00:15:20 with less population are more
00:15:23 important They affect the result
00:15:27 more They have more power than the votes than a
00:15:31 vote from a state where a lot of people live  People
00:15:34 like California, for example, where they have
00:15:37 less weight, have less strength,
00:15:40 less power, no, and these problems also
00:15:44 exist in primary voting, but
00:15:48 as I have told you, that is more complicated and
00:15:51 there are several different systems, and it is
00:15:53 difficult to explain, and there is another
00:15:56 very important difference.  in the
00:15:59 campaigns it
00:16:01 is how they are paid how they are financed
00:16:04 where does the money come from to pay for an
00:16:07 electoral campaign in spain the
00:16:11 elections are financed with
00:16:14 public money with money from the state with
00:16:17 money that comes from taxes according to
00:16:21 the number of members that your party
00:16:24 you have in congress in the senate depending on
00:16:28 the number of votes you got in
00:16:32 the last elections you will receive more
00:16:35 or less  money for your campaign and that
00:16:40 is 80 percent 180 yes yes 80
00:16:45 percent of the money that you can spend in
00:16:49 the elections the other 20% is from your
00:16:54 own money or donations it is a small part
00:16:58 because why is this
00:17:01 supposedly done with  this
00:17:06 reduces corruption reduces levels
00:17:08 of government corruption you reduce the
00:17:11 effect that rich
00:17:14 people rich people have on
00:17:17 democracy they have on the government and yes it
00:17:21 reduces corruption but it also makes it more
00:17:26 difficult for new parties to start no
00:17:30 it's not impossible because there are rules  They
00:17:34 make it a little easier, they make it easier
00:17:36 for small parties to start, but in
00:17:40 general, they don't have this help,
00:17:44 as big as it is in the United States. In the United States,
00:17:51 campaigns in general are mostly
00:17:56 paid for with private money. There is a way
00:18:00 to get public money for
00:18:02 campaigns, but  It has many limitations,
00:18:06 in general, they are paid with private money, they
00:18:09 can pay
00:18:11 and contributions, donations are made to the
00:18:15 campaigns of the different  ering candidates to
00:18:18 be president there
00:18:21 are no limits there are limits on how much
00:18:25 money a single person can give to a
00:18:28 campaign and companies are not allowed to
00:18:32 give money directly to a
00:18:37 candidate no but there is another way since
00:18:43 2010 a company can with its own
00:18:47 money  you can campaign politically you
00:18:50 can pay for ads you can hold
00:18:54 events to support a candidate a
00:18:58 candidate for president of the usa as long as you
00:19:02 don't communicate don't coordinate don't
00:19:05 talk to the president's campaign you
00:19:08 can support him separately on
00:19:12 your own spending all the money you
00:19:15 want  and sometimes these companies spend
00:19:20 more than the official campaign they spend more
00:19:24 money than the candidate
00:19:27 sometimes sometimes it has happened so of course
00:19:31 there are people who think that
00:19:36 this can influence
00:19:40 politicians politicians may feel that they have
00:19:44 to return the favor they have to
00:19:48 help these  companies that have helped them have not
00:19:52 and can cause politicians to
00:19:56 influence the  rich people
00:19:59 and companies that have a lot of money
00:20:01 then the voting is over and
00:20:06 the president is chosen how the government is formed
00:20:11 we are going to talk once you have
00:20:14 the president how the government is formed
00:20:18 in the two countries in spain and in the usa in
00:20:22 spain the president chooses the
00:20:26 ministers ministers
00:20:29 to the ministers the ministers are in
00:20:32 charge of the different ministries
00:20:35 there is the ministry of health of education
00:20:38 of culture they change sometimes even
00:20:44 in each election the ministries change
00:20:47 sometimes there I don't know culture and sports or
00:20:51 education and culture have changed
00:20:55 over time they have changed but it is the
00:20:58 president who chooses them the
00:21:01 minister of defense who leads the
00:21:04 army of spain chooses the minister
00:21:07 of the interior chooses the different
00:21:10 ministers in the usa instead of ministers
00:21:14 there are secretaries and he is also the
00:21:17 the president who chooses the
00:21:20 secretaries but in the usa the senate has
00:21:25 to approve the candidates the senate
00:21:28 has to decide  r that it is worth it that the
00:21:31 candidate that the president has chosen is
00:21:35 good to be secretary of that
00:21:39 department of that department of the
00:21:41 state of the usa and these are the
00:21:45 most important differences in
00:21:48 voting and how we choose
00:21:52 our rulers
00:21:55 well in addition to the fact that in spain  we don't
00:21:59 choose hollywood stars or
00:22:03 reality show actors and so
00:22:06 let me know if you are interested in more
00:22:10 comparisons like this in other
00:22:13 comparisons for example comparisons
00:22:17 of the law of how the law is applied or
00:22:22 how laws are chosen how the law is changed
00:22:25 in different  countries
00:22:28 health comparisons of the health of
00:22:32 the hospitals comparisons of the
00:22:35 education of the schools of the two
00:22:37 countries tell me in the comments
00:22:40 which one you want me to explain and if you

",3
237,"00:00:01 what a shocking news
00:00:06 [Music]
00:00:09 hello guys well yes I suppose you
00:00:13 have already heard or have already seen the news
00:00:16 that the former prime
00:00:20 minister of Japan undoubtedly sees has been assassinated they
00:00:24 have killed him yes
00:00:27 well it is very surprising news of
00:00:30 course especially coming  from Japan and I saw
00:00:34 the news when it was not yet known if he
00:00:38 had died or not they had not yet
00:00:41 announced his death,
00:00:43 only that he had been shot and
00:00:47 I did see the news and I contacted
00:00:49 friends from Japan and such and we were very
00:00:52 surprised no
00:00:55 and well  I am going to explain a little who
00:00:58 was without a key and the news
00:01:01 what happened and without a key was that he was prime
00:01:05 minister until 2020 until only
00:01:09 a couple of years ago when he retired he left the
00:01:14 position due to health problems he said
00:01:17 that because of  health problems he has had the
00:01:20 longest tenure of any
00:01:23 president of any prime minister
00:01:25 of japan this past eight-
00:01:29 year term and before that he
00:01:32 had previously served as prime minister for two  Its
00:01:35 years okay so they attacked him when he
00:01:40 was on the street giving a speech he
00:01:42 was giving a political speech
00:01:45 supporting another person from his
00:01:48 political party nothing nothing it is a city
00:01:51 near osaka in the kansai area of
00:01:55 japan and if he has been shot by a  man with
00:01:58 a homemade shotgun
00:02:01 a homemade weapon that has been manufactured by
00:02:03 himself who has been found on his
00:02:06 computer browser history that has
00:02:10 searched for ways to build
00:02:15 homemade weapons to build homemade bombs and
00:02:19 in that man's apartment they have found
00:02:21 more weapons and bombs  So, if
00:02:25 he was attacked at that event, at the event,
00:02:29 there was little security, there was very little
00:02:31 security, which is common,
00:02:35 normal in Japan, because there are not usually
00:02:38 these types of incidents, there is very little
00:02:40 violence in Japan, so it seems that
00:02:44 the weapon the man was carrying  attacker had
00:02:47 two shots fired once and hit
00:02:51 a bird in the neck and it seems that he turned
00:02:55 to look at where
00:02:58 the shot was coming from and then  it hit him and it hit him in
00:03:01 the heart and it seems that this is the
00:03:04 main reason he died
00:03:07 so the first news was that he
00:03:10 had had a
00:03:13 cardio-respiratory arrest, a
00:03:16 heart and breathing arrest, not
00:03:20 although it seems that in Japan it is common
00:03:23 say that before it is
00:03:27 100 percent confirmed that the person is dead
00:03:30 before a doctor confirms it then
00:03:33 right there right after the shooting they
00:03:36 arrested the assailant they arrested the
00:03:39 attacker and took him to the police at
00:03:43 the police he confessed he didn't try  fleeing
00:03:46 did not deny that he was guilty he confessed what
00:03:50 he had done and he has said that he has
00:03:53 attacked bird because bird was helping
00:03:58 to promote a religious group in japan
00:04:01 a religion and this person the attacker
00:04:06 hates this religion because this
00:04:10 religion had taken away his  he
00:04:13 had made his mother money he had
00:04:16 brainwashed his mother and made his
00:04:19 mother lose all her savings
00:04:21 bankruptcy with no money
00:04:24 i guess i guess i saw  there are going to be
00:04:27 many conspiracy theories because
00:04:31 in this case when important people die
00:04:33 there is always some
00:04:36 conspiracy theory in this case also the
00:04:40 day after the death of birds
00:04:42 there were elections in japan they were
00:04:47 the elections of the house of
00:04:49 councilors the house  of councilors it is the
00:04:52 upper house of the government of japan it is
00:04:55 like the senate no and his party won
00:04:58 abe's party won these elections
00:05:01 that's good one more reason for there
00:05:04 to be conspiracy theories but i think
00:05:08 it's unlikely it's unlikely
00:05:10 any kind  of conspiracy the man
00:05:13 who shot him
00:05:15 lived near where the event took place
00:05:18 the event was scheduled the day before
00:05:22 just the day before so it would have been
00:05:25 difficult to prepare some kind of
00:05:27 conspiracy the attacker
00:05:31 he confessed that the day before just the day
00:05:34 before he had already tried  kill a bird
00:05:38 in another event in a different event
00:05:40 but he had not succeeded and well
00:05:43 after that the police went to the apartment of the
00:05:47 attacker they found more homemade weapons they
00:05:51 found homemade bombs in the
00:05:54 internet history they saw that he had
00:05:56 searched for information on the internet about
00:05:59 how to make them and well and this man
00:06:02 also had no criminal record he had
00:06:05 no criminal record he had not been tried
00:06:07 before for any crime and also the
00:06:11 person who  he has died he was no longer prime
00:06:14 minister at that time he was no longer
00:06:17 perhaps as important a target as he
00:06:20 could have been before when he
00:06:22 was still prime minister so if in japan
00:06:25 there are very few violent crimes that
00:06:30 is why this news is also more surprising
00:06:32 but that also makes  there is less
00:06:35 security at the event there was little
00:06:38 security many times the police in
00:06:41 japan do not even carry a gun they do not
00:06:43 even carry weapons and it is the first
00:06:47 time since the days of the
00:06:49 japanese empire of the second world war and
00:06:53 this is the first time that a
00:06:56 politician has died who  is or has been prime
00:06:59 minister
00:07:00 not so much during the japanese empire
00:07:03 during the japanese empire  yes it was
00:07:05 quite normal to kill each
00:07:09 other politicians who had different
00:07:11 opinions was basically the way of
00:07:15 doing politics at that time but since
00:07:19 then no it hasn't been common
00:07:22 so who was ave ave was a
00:07:26 right wing politician was a
00:07:30 nationalist politician quite a few of  his policies
00:07:34 are nationalist and during his tenure
00:07:38 when he was prime minister he had some
00:07:42 controversies he took some measures that
00:07:45 were
00:07:46 criticized by some and well applauded
00:07:50 applauded or praised by others not one
00:07:53 example is reducing the limits of the
00:07:57 japan self defense forces
00:08:00 japan has a bigger army  or less but
00:08:04 they don't call it an army they call it
00:08:06 self defense forces
00:08:09 because after the end of the second
00:08:12 world war since peace was signed
00:08:15 with the usa the
00:08:17 usa imposed a new constitution and in
00:08:22 the constitution it is said that japan
00:08:24 cannot have an axis
00:08:26 yes that  they have the self defense forces
00:08:29 but they are prohibited from leaving outside the
00:08:34 territory of japan of i  To help
00:08:37 Japan's allies there are quite a few
00:08:40 rules, no, and one thing that Ave did was
00:08:45 eliminate some of these rules, change
00:08:48 some of the rules to give more roles
00:08:52 and put fewer limits on the self-defense forces,
00:08:55 and then it has also had
00:08:57 problems with Korea, with  china first
00:09:02 denied the crimes some crimes that
00:09:06 the japanese had committed in
00:09:08 korea during world war ii and
00:09:11 worsened relations with korea and
00:09:14 was generally regarded as a
00:09:17 historical revisionist as someone who
00:09:20 wanted to not
00:09:23 accept history as it had been explained
00:09:25 until then  And I wanted to explain the
00:09:28 story, change the story a bit
00:09:30 so that it was more favorable to Japan,
00:09:33 although a few years later he did
00:09:36 admit those crimes that Japan had
00:09:40 committed in Korea, although despite the fact that he
00:09:44 had critics, his murder has been
00:09:48 received negatively, it has been
00:09:50 criticized almost unanimously almost
00:09:54 everyone all the important figures from
00:09:57 other countries and within Japan  They have
00:10:00 not condemned the attack and the murder
00:10:05 of sindo ave and this video is up to here if

002,"00:00:00 Hi everyone how are you my name is
00:00:03 Agustina I'm from Argentina and in
00:00:08 today's video I'm going to talk about five things
00:00:12 I don't like about the United States
00:00:17 these are things about the culture and
00:00:22 people in general in the United States that
00:00:27 I personally don't like  I like them a lot
00:00:33 [Music]
00:00:37 Let's start off well first of all the
00:00:41 first thing I don't like very much
00:00:45 about the United States is that there are a lot of
00:00:51 crazy people and I know this seems like a joke it
00:00:56 seems like a joke but it's true when
00:01:01 you go to the United States you see  lots of
00:01:06 crazy weird people on the street and i'm not
00:01:11 talking about the clothes people
00:01:14 wear i'm not talking about
00:01:19 how they look not how they look that doesn't matter to me i
00:01:23 'm talking about the things that make the
00:01:28 way they act  They behave in
00:01:32 a very
00:01:35 strange, very strange way. This usually happens
00:01:40 in the biggest cities, for example,
00:01:44 in New York, there are many people shouting,
00:01:49 drugged, I don't know, jumping in the streets,
00:01:54 entering, not being inside the
00:01:59 stores of the businesses.  and breaking
00:02:02 things
00:02:03 very very strange But in addition to happening in
00:02:10 big cities it also happens in
00:02:13 smaller cities mainly
00:02:18 in stores there aren't many people who are
00:02:22 super super weird when they buy things
00:02:26 when they go to a restaurant there are a lot of
00:02:30 people very
00:02:33 How to say it very rude no  she
00:02:37 's angry that she's bad with the
00:02:40 people who work and that's weird there are a
00:02:45 lot of people arguing fighting in my
00:02:49 experience in other countries that doesn't happen that
00:02:53 much and something related to this issue is
00:02:58 that many times there are weird people who
00:03:02 are clients who  buy things in a
00:03:06 business in a restaurant in a store
00:03:09 and the customer is rare is a person who
00:03:14 treats the seller badly the
00:03:20 employee the person who is working
00:03:22 but another thing that I saw and that I noticed
00:03:28 many times in the United States is  that
00:03:32 the employees are also
00:03:35 very rude not like they are very
00:03:41 reserved and like they treat you badly they
00:03:45 treat the customer badly this happens
00:03:49 mainly in cheaper places yes it
00:03:52 did not happen to me in a restaurant  elegant or
00:03:57 charge but it happened to me in
00:04:01 fast food restaurants and in normal restaurants
00:04:04 Not that many times the people
00:04:07 working do not have patience, they
00:04:12 cannot wait for you to decide or they
00:04:15 do not want to explain to you if you do not understand and it
00:04:19 is something that in other countries I do not
00:04:22 I lived so much again, they exist everywhere
00:04:26 Yes, but it seems to me that much more happens in the United States
00:04:29 than in other places. The
00:04:33 second thing that I don't like very much about the
00:04:36 United States is that the United States is
00:04:40 a very, very Federal country. What do I mean
00:04:44 by very Federal?  each state has In
00:04:49 my opinion too much Independence I
00:04:53 think this is because I come from another
00:04:57 culture and in Argentina life and the
00:05:03 laws the rules the economy is very
00:05:07 similar in all the provinces in
00:05:11 Argentina for example you can drive
00:05:16 you can drive at the  same age at
00:05:20 17 in all provinces you can
00:05:23 vote for president at 16 in
00:05:28 all provinces etcetera etcetera
00:05:30 not all regulations are the same  It is
00:05:34 throughout the country because the country is one but
00:05:37 in the United States
00:05:39 everything is super super different, that is, you
00:05:43 go to a state and they have some laws and some
00:05:47 rules and then you go to another and they are
00:05:49 totally different rules and this happens with
00:05:53 things that are simpler or  They don't matter
00:05:56 as much as, for example,
00:05:59 I don't know at what age you can drive. Not if it's
00:06:04 at 15 or 16, well, it doesn't change much,
00:06:08 but then there are things that are very, very
00:06:12 drastic, such as the death penalty,
00:06:16 not being killed if you commit  if
00:06:21 you do a very important crime
00:06:24 then for me this is wrong yes
00:06:30 why because it makes people
00:06:33 have a
00:06:36 completely different experience in the same country
00:06:40 because it is not the same to be a person
00:06:43 who was born and raised in texas i don't know than to
00:06:47 be a person  who was born and raised in
00:06:51 Michigan no So what about this
00:06:56 when people have to decide they
00:06:59 have to vote for a president or
00:07:03 other things when people have
00:07:06 to form an opinion about their country
00:07:10 they are not in  working on an opinion of the country,
00:07:14 they are not creating a general thought, they
00:07:18 are creating a super
00:07:22 individualist thought of the culture and the place
00:07:25 where they grew up. So from that side,
00:07:29 I don't really like the idea that
00:07:32 each state is so independent from the
00:07:36 others. Well now  We move on to a
00:07:40 much less
00:07:42 controversial topic, it's a calmer topic and
00:07:46 it's coffee and being Argentina with
00:07:51 Italian descent I have to
00:07:54 talk about coffee because it's very bad
00:07:58 guys coffee in the United States is
00:08:01 horrible it's water Ok
00:08:05 first that's super super bad  It's very
00:08:10 watery, it doesn't taste like coffee. Second,
00:08:14 it's normal to drink sugar
00:08:20 because it's not coffee anymore, that with Starbucks and
00:08:25 all the chains, it's normalized that
00:08:28 drinking coffee is drinking a Frappuccino and
00:08:32 no, I like Frappuccinos,
00:08:36 I like them.  the lattes with I don't know flavor of
00:08:41 chocolate caramel I like I can
00:08:44 drink it But that's not a coffee, no, and if
00:08:50 you go to the United States and ask for a I don't know, a
00:08:54 cappuccino doesn't taste like  Coffee is very
00:09:00 difficult, for example, here in Argentina
00:09:02 we have the cortado, which is a coffee with
00:09:07 milk, much more coffee than milk, a
00:09:10 very very good short intense coffee. And if I
00:09:15 want that in the United States, it is super
00:09:19 difficult to find it.
00:09:22 It's almost all
00:09:26 milk, it tastes like milk, not coffee, and a
00:09:30 cappuccino isn't, the coffee is
00:09:33 n't strong enough, so
00:09:36 finding good coffee in the United States is
00:09:40 super, super difficult, and not only that,
00:09:44 I also have another problem, which is that
00:09:48 the coffee shops, not the stores that  They sell
00:09:52 coffee, they
00:09:53 close super early and this is related
00:10:01 to meals and the hours, for example,
00:10:05 of dinner in the United States, which is very
00:10:09 early, it's like six seven,
00:10:11 so after two in the afternoon
00:10:15 you can't find coffee and that's  It bothers me a
00:10:22 lot because I like
00:10:25 coffee and I like to have coffee in the afternoon
00:10:28 at 5 in the afternoon, no, because I have dinner
00:10:33 at 8, not at 9, so I need a
00:10:38 little coffee, something sweet to  to eat at 5 in the
00:10:42 afternoon and in the United States I can't
00:10:45 find it, that is, the only thing that
00:10:48 is still open at that time is
00:10:53 Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, I don't eat brands or
00:10:57 coffee chains of that style, but
00:11:01 they don't have real coffee.  that the
00:11:05 United States please
00:11:07 learn to drink coffee yes Well then
00:11:12 we continue with another issue that bothers me
00:11:15 but I accept I accept that it is wrong that it
00:11:20 bothers me and it is the traffic but not the
00:11:26 traffic in the sense that there are many
00:11:29 cars because that
00:11:32 happens in Argentina it happens in  everywhere No
00:11:35 but what bothers me is how they
00:11:38 drive in the United States
00:11:42 but this bothers me and affects me
00:11:47 because I am from Argentina Yes because for
00:11:50 example in Europe it is the same way
00:11:52 so I accept that no it is not a  error
00:11:57 is not necessarily a bad thing in the
00:12:00 United States But I still wanted to
00:12:03 comment on it because it is something interesting and it
00:12:06 is that in Argentina we drive
00:12:10 fast, that is, we drive, we
00:12:14 are very practical
00:12:17 and it is like everything sees  Everything flows super fast
00:12:21 Yes, and if you, for example, stop at
00:12:26 a stop sign, at a stop sign in
00:12:29 Argentina, they start to touch you,
00:12:33 go ahead, what are you doing standing up? No, so
00:12:36 for me when I go to the United
00:12:39 States and see how people drive  Super
00:12:43 slow, respecting all the rules, it
00:12:48 's terrible for me. I mean, people
00:12:52 stop at a stop
00:12:56 sign when there's no one on the street, they
00:13:00 stop at night and it's like why, I mean,
00:13:03 why do you do that?  It bothers me, it
00:13:06 bothers me a lot to pass, for example,
00:13:09 on the highway on the road when
00:13:12 a car has to pass another, they wait
00:13:15 20,000 years for everything to be empty to
00:13:19 pass, perfect in Argentina, you pass Between
00:13:23 four cars you go, no, and well, it's
00:13:27 something that when I  I'm in the United
00:13:30 States and I'm with someone in a
00:13:33 I always say oh god please speed up,
00:13:36 we're taking twice as long but
00:13:41 hey I accept that it's safer yes it's
00:13:46 safer to do it like in the United States
00:13:47 so it's a bit of a mistake  from Argentina
00:13:51 Yes but also when I go it
00:13:56 's really annoying Well now we come to
00:13:59 the fifth thing that bothers me about the United
00:14:03 States that I don't like this country very much
00:14:06 and this thing is that traveling within
00:14:12 the country is very expensive guys I really
00:14:18 don't understand  why is it so expensive because
00:14:24 even using Traveling on
00:14:30 low cost airlines that are not low cost but well
00:14:34 like Spirit Frontier not among others
00:14:38 Southwest more or less It's still super
00:14:43 super expensive so for me it's
00:14:48 crazy to pay I don't know 600 dollars to go
00:14:53 from  from the center of the United States to the
00:14:57 east coast or the west coast when for
00:15:01 200 dollars you can go to the Caribbean I
00:15:06 can't tell you I don't know about the Dominican
00:15:09 Republic or the Bahamas it's not like it's super super
00:15:13 expensive and I'm not just talking about the
00:15:16 most touristy places like  New York Los
00:15:20 Angeles I'm talking about all the
00:15:23 places, that is, you can go to I don't know in
00:15:28 Lewis, not that it's a big city but
00:15:31 it's not the most touristy city and a hotel
00:15:34 in San Luis is going to cost you  or you will not
00:15:38 get a minimum of 100 dollars per night, which
00:15:43 is not normal in other parts of the world,
00:15:46 obviously in Argentina due to inflation
00:15:50 and the economic situation, it is super
00:15:54 super cheap and I do not expect the United
00:15:59 States to be like Argentina, I do not expect
00:16:02 that  the prices are the same but if we
00:16:06 compare the United States with certain
00:16:09 countries in Europe that are good, for
00:16:12 example France Germany Spain among
00:16:17 others in those European countries you have
00:16:21 many more opportunities to travel
00:16:24 to get a flight or a train or a
00:16:29 cheap bus to get the first option of
00:16:33 no cheap hotel and in the United States that
00:16:37 is very difficult so I feel that
00:16:42 internal tourism is not justified to
00:16:45 travel within the United States because
00:16:49 you are paying almost the same price as
00:16:52 if you went to places much further away and
00:16:56 with more different cultures and that for
00:17:00 It is more interesting for me to know why it
00:17:03 is not your own culture, but hey
00:17:07 guys, here is today's video of the
00:17:11 five things I don't like about Es  United
00:17:14 States obviously This video is just
00:17:17 for
00:17:18 fun and to expose a bit of the
00:17:22 differences that I, from my point of
00:17:25 view and from my culture and my
00:17:28 experience as Argentina, see as
00:17:32 different Or maybe bothersome in the United
00:17:35 States but obviously I am not saying
00:17:38 that Argentina is  better than everything
00:17:42 we do It's better or that those
00:17:44 things are necessarily wrong they're just
00:17:48 things that I personally find
00:17:51 weird and don't like very much I'm going to make
00:17:54 a video about the things I
00:17:58 do like about the United States I'm going to make a

056,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about why it is better not to
00:00:05 speak
00:00:06 when learning a language when we study
00:00:09 a language especially at the beginning and
00:00:13 for a long time when we start
00:00:16 to learn it I think it is better not to speak
00:00:20 not to practice speaking the language and in
00:00:25 this video I am going to  explain why
00:00:29 [Music]
00:00:33 well
00:00:35 hello as you can see I'm on the beach
00:00:40 I'm on a beach with boats boats
00:00:46 and today I'm not in Thailand no now
00:00:51 I'm a few days several days I'm in
00:00:55 Malaysia I've come to Malaysia mainly
00:00:59 because of the visa issue  passport visa
00:01:03 I don't need a visa to
00:01:06 stay in Thailand any longer and I
00:01:09 came here to the island of Penang, it's in
00:01:13 Penang, in Malaysia,
00:01:16 and
00:01:18 I want to tell you why because I think
00:01:21 it's better not to speak, not to practice
00:01:23 speaking a language
00:01:27 above all.  at the beginning, especially the
00:01:30 first months or years,
00:01:35 and that is why
00:01:37 I think that when we learn
00:01:40 a language, it comes from outside, we learn
00:01:44 with input, we do not learn by listening to
00:01:47 reading,
00:01:49 but at the beginning it is better.  listening and
00:01:54 speaking speaking has a problem and the
00:01:58 problem is that at the beginning before
00:02:03 reaching a good level
00:02:05 we don't know how to speak we don't know the sentences
00:02:09 we are saying we don't know if they are
00:02:13 well said if the grammar is correct if
00:02:17 the other person is going to tell us  understand or not
00:02:20 we do not know if the sounds the sounds the
00:02:25 pronunciation we are saying it well or
00:02:28 not or we are not saying it well
00:02:31 and when we speak our brain at the
00:02:37 beginning still does not know it does not know
00:02:40 the grammar well it does not know the sounds well the
00:02:44 phonetics the sounds the pronunciation
00:02:47 You still don't know them well so
00:02:50 when we speak our brain has
00:02:54 to use it has to take other things not
00:02:57 the real sound not the real grammar
00:03:00 of the language but it has to
00:03:02 take other things and the brain takes well
00:03:07 the grammar of our language takes the
00:03:11 pronunciation  of our language or take
00:03:15 our idea of ​​grammar or our
00:03:18 idea of ​​pronunciation in the other
00:03:20 language but we still don't know
00:03:23 it well  Because we still haven't
00:03:27 listened enough, we haven't listened much and we
00:03:31 have to listen a lot, a lot,
00:03:34 and I never tire of repeating it and I'll keep
00:03:37 repeating it, we have to listen a lot and
00:03:40 before having listened for hundreds of
00:03:42 hours, before having listened
00:03:44 possibly for a thousand hours, our brain
00:03:48 still hasn't heard.  You know how it sounds and you don't
00:03:51 know what the grammar of the
00:03:54 language is,
00:03:55 so take the grammar of the
00:03:59 pronunciation of our language or take
00:04:02 the grammar and pronunciation that
00:04:03 we think we know
00:04:06 but that we still don't know
00:04:09 well and mix it up  with the things
00:04:13 that we do know with the part of the
00:04:16 sound the part of the grammar that
00:04:19 we know the things that we have already
00:04:22 learned that we already know well
00:04:25 mix them and it all ends up being a mix
00:04:29 an odd mix of well
00:04:33 said and well pronounced things  and of things
00:04:37 that are not well said, which is
00:04:40 a mixture with
00:04:41 the lamatica of our language, for example,
00:04:44 if we are learning  ndo Spanish but when
00:04:48 we were little we learned English our
00:04:51 language our mother tongue our
00:04:53 mother tongue is English and we are
00:04:56 learning Spanish we try to say
00:04:59 we try to say things in Spanish
00:05:01 we try to speak Spanish but we end up
00:05:05 mixing up the grammar of English
00:05:08 we end up not using the subjunctive or
00:05:13 not knowing the words  if they are
00:05:16 masculine or feminine
00:05:17 mixing it up and we get used to it we get into
00:05:22 the habit of saying things wrong not to
00:05:25 say them in another way and this is very
00:05:29 difficult then forgetting no we
00:05:32 do not forget it
00:05:34 is very difficult to stop these bad habits
00:05:38 forget the things we have learned
00:05:41 wrong and above all  it is not necessary it is not
00:05:45 necessary because to learn to speak you have
00:05:48 to listen you don't need to talk a lot
00:05:52 especially at the beginning
00:05:55 so why talk if above
00:05:59 all it is going to be something bad no better talk
00:06:02 later talk when the
00:06:06 sounds already when the grammar
00:06:08 we already know it well then we can
00:06:12 start talking and we will improve
00:06:15 we will improve very quickly and for me
00:06:20 this is happening now now I have
00:06:23 started to speak Thai and at the
00:06:28 beginning when I started to speak I
00:06:31 had already listened to Thai for maybe two
00:06:34 thousand hours
00:06:37 and I am a bit extreme there is no need to be
00:06:40 so extreme but in  My case 2000
00:06:43 hours of Thai and I started to speak and
00:06:48 at first in my head
00:06:51 Thai sounded differently in my head and
00:06:54 Thai in my mouth sounded different
00:06:57 but I had to practice speaking to
00:07:01 speaking I have spoken for a few hours maybe I
00:07:05 don't know five  or ten hours of speaking
00:07:08 Thai and now it's the same what sounds
00:07:12 in my head and what I say what I
00:07:15 pronounce sounds the same and I realized
00:07:19 that because I had listened and listened a
00:07:22 lot before now I have had to
00:07:25 practice speaking very little very little
00:07:28 and I've already come to speak speak well
00:07:33 because I haven't practiced
00:07:36 speaking I haven't tried to speak before
00:07:39 I haven't mixed or I haven't mixed much
00:07:44 Thai with other languages ​​and
00:07:48 pronunciation  When I talk to people,
00:07:50 Thai people understand me well and it is
00:07:54 difficult for many foreigners who
00:07:57 come to Thailand. They try to speak
00:07:59 Thai and end up speaking very very badly
00:08:03 with sounds that they do not understand, they
00:08:07 do not know what they are saying and for this
00:08:10 reason I think it is good to
00:08:12 speak.  leave talking for later don't
00:08:17 talk don't talk don't practice speaking
00:08:19 at the beginning and for a long time
00:08:22 for hundreds of hours several hundred
00:08:26 I don't know five hundred thousand hours surely it's
00:08:30 worth saying write me below what do
00:08:34 you think okay come to god
",3
255,"00:00:00 no you don't understand what you hear you can't
00:00:04 speak you can't say a sentence without
00:00:08 first having to think in English or
00:00:11 your language and then translate in
00:00:14 your head Well in this video I'm going
00:00:19 to explain the solution I'm going to explain
00:00:24 how to fix the problem
00:00:28 [  Music]
00:00:32 Well I know that many of you have
00:00:36 this problem because you write me a lot of
00:00:40 comments on YouTube and I see many
00:00:44 people asking this question on
00:00:47 internet forums and so on because it is
00:00:51 a big problem and why is it a
00:00:53 good problem first when you are
00:00:57 receiving  input when you are watching
00:01:00 videos and if you are translating in your
00:01:04 head you get tired you get tired you get tired more
00:01:08 you get tired faster so every day
00:01:12 you can watch less content you can't
00:01:15 watch so many hours of content because
00:01:19 you get tired very quickly another problem is
00:01:23 that if  when you are listening you hear a
00:01:27 word and you start translating it in your
00:01:30 head you are missing the next
00:01:33 words all the words that come
00:01:37 after you don't  you are listening you are not
00:01:40 paying attention another problem is that
00:01:44 even if you translate a word you take a
00:01:48 word and translate it translate it into
00:01:51 a word in your language many times
00:01:54 you still do not understand it you do not understand it
00:01:57 Because this word in this situation is
00:02:02 not used in your language would you use a
00:02:04 different word does not fit in this situation
00:02:08 So if you solve this problem if you
00:02:12 manage to fix this problem you will be
00:02:14 able to directly connect the
00:02:18 sound of a word with its meaning
00:02:22 with what it means you will
00:02:25 connect them just like
00:02:28 native speakers of the language connect them you will be able to process what
00:02:32 you hear more  faster you will be able to understand what
00:02:35 you hear faster you will be able to understand
00:02:38 when people speak fast they speak
00:02:41 speak speak when they speak very
00:02:43 fast you will be able to understand them and of course
00:02:46 because you will not have to concentrate
00:02:50 so much you will be able to Listen Every day many
00:02:54 hours many hours listen or read
00:02:57 many hours of Spanish every  day and you will
00:03:00 advance faster faster  o
00:03:03 So why does this happen why
00:03:06 translate in your head well first I
00:03:12 have to confess one thing to me it doesn't
00:03:15 happen to me I don't have this problem This
00:03:19 is not a problem that everyone has, it
00:03:21 is a problem that you have because of the
00:03:26 way you  You study a language
00:03:29 So, since I learn languages ​​with
00:03:33 comprehensible input, it usually doesn't
00:03:37 happen to me It doesn't happen to me at least
00:03:39 in a general way In a general way
00:03:42 I never think of entire sentences in
00:03:47 Spanish or English and then I translate them
00:03:50 into another language no sometimes yes  that I have
00:03:55 connected a word for example I am
00:03:58 learning Thai Well I have connected a
00:04:01 word in Thai with an
00:04:04 English word for some reason because someone
00:04:07 has told me what it means in
00:04:10 English or something yes some word Yes and
00:04:14 these words when I hear them I give
00:04:17 account Oh yes I have translated it I am
00:04:20 thinking about the meaning in another
00:04:22 language but in general no
00:04:26 so that is why this problem occurs
00:04:29 because you have studied the language
00:04:32 connecting the words of the
00:04:36 Spanish language for example with the words of
00:04:39 your language or because you have
00:04:43 studied them from a book because you have
00:04:45 looked at them in a dictionary or because you
00:04:49 have thought about it you have seen a word
00:04:51 in Spanish and looking at it in the context
00:04:55 you have thought or well  this in english
00:04:58 means
00:05:00 chair or whatever no So how do we
00:05:04 solve this problem with
00:05:08 understandable input bye
00:05:11 this is not a joke I'm going to explain why
00:05:15 but hey the answer will not
00:05:18 surprise you Because these videos in all
00:05:22 these videos in the end the solution is
00:05:26 comprehensible input no but really
00:05:29 this problem is a very very
00:05:33 clear situation of the benefits of comprehensible input it
00:05:36 is one of the problems
00:05:39 with which it helps the most that it solves the best
00:05:43 so to start solving this
00:05:47 problem you have to realize one
00:05:51 thing you have to accept  one thing is
00:05:55 that you probably don't know so many
00:05:59 words you
00:06:00 think you know surely you don't
00:06:03 know so many words  open you have to
00:06:08 realize that the words you have
00:06:11 studied the words you have
00:06:14 learned
00:06:15 translating them translating them
00:06:17 connecting them with a word in English
00:06:20 those words you still don't really know you
00:06:24 don't know yet you don't
00:06:28 know it acquired they are not yet they are not
00:06:31 yours And you still have to
00:06:34 acquire them  So what do I recommend? I
00:06:37 recommend that you look at content
00:06:41 that is easier than that you look at content at a
00:06:44 lower level because if you have learned
00:06:48 you have studied many words and
00:06:51 translating translating in your
00:06:54 head you could understand a higher
00:06:57 level but the goal here is not to
00:07:01 have to translate in your head
00:07:04 then lower the level so that you
00:07:08 understand so that most of the
00:07:11 words that today are words that
00:07:14 you have already acquired that you don't have
00:07:17 to think to understand them a
00:07:20 very easy way to know if something is at
00:07:25 the right level for you is that
00:07:28 you can understand  the content Even if the
00:07:32 person talks fast even if he talks  e
00:07:35 pretty fast if you need to listen to
00:07:38 it slower if you have to watch it a few
00:07:42 times to understand it
00:07:44 probably the level is
00:07:48 too high and you need to watch
00:07:51 something a bit lower level So
00:07:55 my advice is to keep watching
00:07:58 content keep writing input But
00:08:01 input that is really understandable
00:08:05 to you see you later And if you want to
00:08:09 know the best way to improve
00:08:13 your Spanish Take a look at
00:08:17 our method page where we explain how to
00:08:21 improve at each level and how to use
00:08:25 our videos how to watch our
00:08:29 videos to learn Spanish in the best
00:08:33 way

",3
067,"00:00:00 Do you remember that I asked you a question I
00:00:05 asked you what is your
00:00:09 favorite thing in Spain or Latin America well
00:00:15 in this video I am going to say I am going to summarize
00:00:19 the answers the answers that
00:00:23 you have given me
00:00:27 [Music]
00:00:30 ah
00:00:31 hello well yes you have given me many
00:00:35 many  answers and many people have
00:00:40 chosen various things many people
00:00:43 like various things from Latin America,
00:00:46 Spanish America or Spain
00:00:50 but there is one thing there is one thing that is
00:00:54 good it is the winner it is the thing that
00:00:57 most people like and it is good quite
00:01:02 obvious because  It's the food, not the food.
00:01:06 Well, we all love
00:01:09 food and many of you like
00:01:14 Spanish food. Do
00:01:16 you like food from a country in
00:01:20 Latin America, Mexico or some other
00:01:23 place in Latin America,
00:01:26 and yes, for many of you, food
00:01:31 It is a great motivation to learn
00:01:34 Spanish, surely because you want to be able to
00:01:38 go to the restaurant and order,
00:01:42 please, sir, some tacos, some tacos,
00:01:44 thank you, right, sure, the second thing
00:01:49 Secondly, it is also something
00:01:52 quite well known in
00:01:56 Spanish America, especially in Spain - but it
00:01:59 is also a little known, but
00:02:02 above all in Spanish America, which is very
00:02:05 famous and it is
00:02:08 music, Latin American music, not Latin music,
00:02:13 and in Spain as well.  There are also
00:02:18 well-known groups and singers, but especially in
00:02:21 Latin America because there are many styles
00:02:24 of both singing music and dancing
00:02:28 that are well known throughout the world
00:02:32 and in many countries of the world you can
00:02:35 listen to music in Spanish, music in
00:02:38 Spanish,
00:02:39 you can listen well to the  Shakira but
00:02:42 also, of course, slowly and a
00:02:45 lot of music in Spanish
00:02:50 is heard all over the world and it
00:02:53 is also something that you like and you
00:02:57 know many groups, also groups
00:03:00 that sing in Spanish or artists that
00:03:02 sing in Spanish who are not  very
00:03:05 well known are not very popular so I
00:03:08 think many of you have
00:03:11 investigated you have found out a little
00:03:14 you have searched m  music in Spanish and
00:03:18 you have met you have found something
00:03:21 that you really like and then there are less
00:03:25 people but there are still a lot of people
00:03:28 there are 44 people who have said they
00:03:31 like the culture the culture in
00:03:35 general the culture of the country or the
00:03:38 aesthetics someone commented on the
00:03:42 Aesthetics, indigenous clothing, for example, he
00:03:45 likes
00:03:47 and other people rather culture in
00:03:50 general, art and other things from the
00:03:54 culture of the countries
00:03:58 and tied with the culture also with
00:04:02 four people who have commented it is
00:04:05 the people the people we the people of
00:04:10 Spanish-speaking Spanish-Americans
00:04:13 or Spanish
00:04:16 some of you say you
00:04:19 like people you like personality
00:04:22 our personality how we treat
00:04:26 people that perhaps in many
00:04:29 Spanish-speaking countries people are quite
00:04:32 friendly they are nice they like to make
00:04:37 friends they like to have a good time they like
00:04:40 the party and well it can be I think that
00:04:44 in many Latin American countries
00:04:47 people are kinder and more yes more am  It should be noted
00:04:52 that in many places in Spain in Spain
00:04:55 there are also differences between north and
00:04:58 south and different areas there are more
00:05:01 or less friendly people who like to
00:05:03 make friends more or less and well in
00:05:07 Latin America there are also no
00:05:08 differences but I would say that in many
00:05:11 countries in  Hispanic America, well, they are
00:05:15 nicer, friendlier than in Spain,
00:05:19 but the two countries continue to be
00:05:22 friendlier,
00:05:23 people from northern Europe or other
00:05:26 countries, for example, and the next thing
00:05:29 is the climate, the climate, the climate is
00:05:33 said a lot about Spain, there is very good
00:05:35 weather a lot of sun it doesn't rain a lot
00:05:39 but one person from the comments
00:05:42 likes the weather
00:05:44 the weather in costa rica during the
00:05:47 rainy season the weather when it rains when it
00:05:50 rains a lot he likes it maybe he likes it he

00:06:38 Spain also on television in
00:06:40 Spain we also have soap operas and they
00:06:43 are quite famous I think they
00:06:45 are quite famous in many countries and
00:06:49 well things like that are
00:06:53 normal here but there are a couple of people who
00:06:58 have said things  specific not on the
00:07:01 same topics the same previous topics such
00:07:04 as culture or music or dance
00:07:08 that have given very specific answers
00:07:11 and a person has said that he loves
00:07:15 tango he really likes tango tango
00:07:19 and tango is a dance a dance  from
00:07:23 argentina or at least it is very popular

00:07:33 travel argentina only for  to dance
00:07:36 to dance tango
00:07:39 and lastly a person who
00:07:43 likes music spanish
00:07:48 renaissance music
00:07:52 renaissance music renaissance music i
00:07:55 don't know what it's like i don't know what it's like
00:07:59 spanish renaissance music the
00:08:02 renaissance was a long time ago  a
00:08:05 long time ago in the century I don't know the 18th century or
00:08:10 thereabouts but I don't know exactly how it is and in
00:08:13 the person the person who wrote the
00:08:16 comment put a link has put a
00:08:18 link a link to watch watch a video
00:08:21 with renaissance music so I
00:08:24 'm going  I'm going to look at it
00:08:27 [Music]
00:08:33 okay if it sounds familiar I think I've heard I've
00:08:37 heard music like this I don't
00:08:40 know it I don't know it well but I do think that for
00:08:43 example in music Spanish music from the
00:08:47 war music from the time of the
00:08:50 civil war music from  war
00:08:52 was quite similar it was a bit
00:08:55 similar to this the way they sang and
00:08:58 the melody and such was something similar
00:09:02 so it sounds good to me it sounds quite
00:09:05 good to me and well I'm glad I'm glad you
00:09:07 like it and here it ends  That's it,
00:09:11 these are all the things that you have

00:00:42 play yes then this is the game no
00:00:46 dream on and in this game we have 2
00:00:50 minutes
00:00:51 we have two minutes to tell a
00:00:55 story but a story that  it is a
00:00:58 dream
00:00:59 we are not sleeping we have a dream
00:01:03 and we have letters we have letters
00:01:08 and with these letters the letters have
00:01:10 pictures have pictures and with these
00:01:15 pictures
00:01:16 we have to tell a story
00:01:21 and then we have to remember to
00:01:24 remember the story
00:01:27 and the story begins with a  excavator
00:01:33 there is an excavator
00:01:36 we have two minutes our cards
00:01:54 okay then come prepared ready that
00:01:58 's it excavator was in a
00:02:01 field full of wheat a field of wheat and
00:02:03 it was not destroying stables  a rampaging
00:02:06 because that bulldozer had been used
00:02:09 for a crime to kill a person
00:02:12 a person who had a pipe a pipe
00:02:16 and that person was a panda bear a panda bear
00:02:20 who liked to smoke a pipe that
00:02:23 person also found a letter in the
00:02:26 middle of  The entire camp found the
00:02:28 letter for that reason or they murdered him
00:02:32 [Music]
00:02:37 and they took him to the hospital they took him to the
00:02:40 hospital but he didn't die he died
00:02:43 the doctor who treated him was very angry
00:02:47 but god raised him up god raised the
00:02:52 dead man the dead oysters  and the doctor the
00:02:57 doctor was happy he's dead of
00:03:01 something all the books he
00:03:03 'd read all the books were in
00:03:06 him
00:03:08 in full rare because they break he
00:03:11 had 13 gigs guys it
00:03:14 was rare worldwide and everyone
00:03:18 is in the universe that they would donate
00:03:21 alien had not thought then and
00:03:23 camellia 3 no
00:03:26 these aliens came to earth
00:03:28 they showed up on a plane on a plane
00:03:32 that followed the rainbow to find out where to
00:03:34 land
00:03:37 a rainbow  that hit in a very
00:03:42 leafy forest in a forest specifically fell
00:03:45 into a cake and the aliens
00:03:47 were able to taste the cake of the earth
00:03:49 also the birds that inhabited the
00:03:51 forest were able to taste this cake a
00:03:54 cake so good that it reminded the one
00:03:57 that mom used to make  our mother was doing and she's
00:04:00 already counting the time two minutes is already
00:04:05 very good and very long very long and very
00:04:10 strange strange to see if we can if
00:04:14 this is our dream our story and
00:04:18 these are the points our points not
00:04:22 knowing how many points we got ok
00:04:27 then  who starts at 15 agrees
00:04:32 and I start there was a bulldozer
00:04:36 a dream with a bulldozer has started
00:04:39 I know very well two points are already are
00:04:43 already agreed so two points stacks
00:04:46 let's go so this bulldozer
00:04:50 was bulldozing
00:04:53 bulldozing a field of wheat a field
00:04:57 where  there was wheat with the wheat it becomes
00:05:00 pam pam pam haq and the bulldozer
00:05:03 was destroying it it was not destroying
00:05:07 12 points
00:05:08 if I agreed I agreed I agreed
00:05:11 well and in this field there was a man if
00:05:15 I remember correctly dead yes with the
00:05:19 excavator I had hired an exact man
00:05:25 here she is dead fat and
00:05:29 now next to this person of this
00:05:32 dead man there was an object yes but I
00:05:35 don't remember the object there was something that  there was
00:05:38 a letter
00:05:41 no we don't have to help
00:05:49 if that dead man smoked a pipe and
00:05:54 since we helped sonia it's
00:05:57 one point one point only one point is
00:05:59 worth and the dead man walked the meter if the
00:06:04 dead man was a panda he was a bear apples
00:06:08 or send  a panda bear who liked to
00:06:10 smoke a pipe very well the panda bear
00:06:15 when he was found dead they
00:06:17 took him to the hospital he went to the hospital there
00:06:22 was no letter next to the pan bear anymore
00:06:25 and also in addition to the pipe there was a
00:06:28 load of the letter a letter  what happened
00:06:31 with the letter nothing not at all
00:06:36 when checking a letter
00:06:39 okay what else
00:06:45 I don't remember now what comes from
00:06:47 history maybe
00:06:49 whenever we have it seems to me that now
00:06:53 with the dead man they took him to the hospital
00:06:58 I know very well  No, yes, it's worth two points,
00:07:05 but he was already dead and he's dead, the
00:07:10 doctor got angry, exactly, he's very
00:07:13 angry because the doctor was, but the
00:07:17 doctor, the doctor was angry because
00:07:21 he couldn't do his job, but he's already
00:07:24 dead, because why did he bring it to me, what else,
00:07:28 but God  I think God revives the
00:07:32 results enough and everyone agrees
00:07:38 and the panda and it's enough to search is has
00:07:43 exalted it was the band and it is revived and the
00:07:47 back and it seems to me that now it comes when the
00:07:51 whole pile of
00:07:58 books is someone who was angry and  the
00:08:03 doctor got very angry not now it's
00:08:06 past but it's here now as he
00:08:15 was alive again the doctor
00:08:19 the doctor thought that good that I
00:08:23 have studied I have studied many books
00:08:26 is now god help me because I have read
00:08:29 many books yes here no no  It makes a lot of
00:08:33 sense but if the doctor says it pays
00:08:36 very well to be a doctor you have to read a
00:08:39 lot he says you have to read read a lot very
00:08:41 well
00:08:46 these books where
00:08:50 these books were they came out
00:08:55 of a forest
00:08:57 not n  or I think they were inside
00:09:02 a usb stick from a usb drive,
00:09:08 not
00:09:09 that I remember now and I even remember
00:09:13 the next one but Latvia
00:09:18 it seems to me
00:09:23 I don't remember helping me
00:09:26 [Music]
00:09:37 this was unique in the whole world exactly
00:09:41 for the world it was even  strange in the
00:09:45 universe where we went to the back where
00:09:48 the aliens live these these
00:09:51 terrestrials came to earth in a plane
00:09:57 and followed you can pass it to me where to
00:10:00 land
00:10:02 rainbow they followed them ok that
00:10:07 rainbow ended in a forest yes a forest
00:10:12 in leafy forest very leafy tree  it is
00:10:15 very very tight very tight from jara and it
00:10:17 seems that now it comes in the cake menu
00:10:21 not to him
00:10:28 the
00:10:30 street cake is not a cake
00:10:34 and he hopes
00:10:36 that the aliens ate the
00:10:39 cake but also the little birds
00:10:42 of the forest ate the cake no
00:10:48 [Music]
00:10:49 and
00:10:53 end of the story they
00:10:56 didn't eat the little birds and someone else
00:11:02 but I don't remember not the cake was
00:11:05 so delicious they resorted to remembering
00:11:08 their mom's mom's cake yes that's true  to
00:11:12 remember the mother's cake well very
00:11:16 well we have remembered ourselves enough I
00:11:18 think yes I think it has not gone bad
00:11:20 we have here minus two points
00:11:25 - 2
00:11:27 okay here we have
00:11:31 1 2 3 4 5
00:11:37 + 5 and here
00:11:41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 30
00:11:53 15 230 30 points in total
00:11:57 33
00:12:00 33 let's see what the game says
00:12:07 between 31 and 45 it's not 33 if you manage to
00:12:13 reconstruct entire scenes from your
00:12:16 dream no this is our dream and then
00:12:20 we wake up and remember  of
00:12:23 scenes of whole pieces of our
00:12:25 dream and during the rest of the day our
00:12:29 hearts are gratified we feel good
00:12:31 well it's that my dream has reminded me of me
00:12:34 my dream is going very well yes it's
00:12:37 fun right and very much of the day
00:12:39 thank you for coming and you're welcome  help me
00:12:43 play

060,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about extensive reading,
00:00:04 which is a method that I
00:00:07 recommend and that works very well for me
00:00:09 to improve to improve in a language
00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:17 oh
00:00:19 well, first of all, I would like to say that
00:00:25 extensive reading is not something that I
00:00:28 recommend for everyone.  the world I do not
00:00:30 recommend it for everyone I do not recommend it
00:00:33 if you are not at a certain level at a
00:00:37 certain level in the language you are
00:00:39 learning if you are learning
00:00:41 Spanish I do not recommend starting to start
00:00:45 reading until you are very
00:00:49 used to it until you know very
00:00:52 well how  It sounds like Spanish
00:00:55 sounds, the sounds of Spanish, that's why in this
00:00:59 and all the other videos I
00:01:02 recommend first, first, listen and
00:01:05 listen for a long, long, long time
00:01:08 until you're at an
00:01:10 intermediate-high level,
00:01:13 but once once you've already heard a
00:01:17 lot, you've heard hundreds.  hours
00:01:20 maybe even a thousand hours so I think
00:01:25 it's a good idea to start reading by reading
00:01:29 reading is a very good thing to improve
00:01:32 our vocabulary  io to learn
00:01:34 new words because only by
00:01:38 talking to people or
00:01:40 listening to series or movies you
00:01:44 learn vocabulary but it is a certain
00:01:47 vocabulary and in books when you read
00:01:50 a different vocabulary is used and
00:01:53 reading is very good to improve to
00:01:56 learn that vocabulary
00:01:59 and there is  different types of reading there are
00:02:01 different ways to read from reading a
00:02:04 book or reading any text and one
00:02:07 way that I do not recommend is
00:02:10 intensive reading intensive reading is
00:02:14 intensive because you have to concentrate a
00:02:17 lot or not with intensive reading
00:02:20 we read we read a book but also
00:02:23 we analyze we analyze we think about
00:02:26 grammar
00:02:27 we look up words in the dictionary
00:02:29 we look in the dictionary we look at how
00:02:32 that word is said in English or in
00:02:35 our language we use that translation and
00:02:38 analyze and do other things
00:02:42 maybe we read we read the same thing several times
00:02:44 but extensive reading is
00:02:49 different  extensive reading is how
00:02:53 we read our own language  but
00:02:56 when I read a book in Spanish I
00:03:00 am not thinking I want to improve my Spanish
00:03:03 I am not thinking I want to improve my
00:03:06 grammar or my vocabulary I read a
00:03:08 book in Spanish because I like the
00:03:11 book because it interests me because I want to
00:03:13 know something new I want to learn something or
00:03:17 because  I want to entertain myself I want to
00:03:19 have fun reading a book reading a
00:03:22 novel for example
00:03:24 extensive reading is the same thing we read
00:03:28 for pleasure we read something we like and
00:03:32 we don't stop we don't stop to look up
00:03:35 words in the dictionary we don't
00:03:37 stop to think about the grammar to
00:03:40 analyze no  we read and if there is a
00:03:44 word that we do not understand we
00:03:47 skip it and we continue reading
00:03:51 there are several good things about extensive reading
00:03:56 the first is that it is fun
00:04:00 we do not get bored and we do not get tired we do not get
00:04:04 tired and since we do not get tired
00:04:06 we read more  we read more quantity we read a
00:04:10 lot and we also read more often more
00:04:14 frequently we read more days because if it
00:04:18 is something that is fun than  we don't get
00:04:21 bored it's not tiring we're going to
00:04:23 do it more because we like it we're going to
00:04:25 do it more times and that's a very
00:04:28 good thing about extensive reading
00:04:30 another thing is that because of how we learn
00:04:35 how to learn a word or
00:04:38 learn an expression we have  we have to see it
00:04:41 several times we have to see it
00:04:43 many times used in different
00:04:46 situations used in different
00:04:49 contexts and extensive reading gives us
00:04:52 that we don't have to focus we
00:04:55 don't have to analyze this word I
00:04:58 don't know it to see what this word is
00:05:00 no because this word is  we will
00:05:03 see it again we will see it more times and with
00:05:05 extensive reading it is a bit like
00:05:08 how to listen extensively the same as
00:05:11 my videos in the end extensive reading
00:05:15 is the same the same as my videos is
00:05:20 is in my videos you are listening to something
00:05:22 and you don't have to stop  and look in a
00:05:27 dictionary and things like that, I don't
00:05:30 explain the grammar or vocabulary to you either,
00:05:33 because with extensive reading it's the
00:05:36 same, you take what you are  ready
00:05:40 to know you take what is easy for you to
00:05:43 know
00:05:45 if there is a word or something you don't
00:05:47 know you skip them and pass it
00:05:51 and extensive reading has
00:05:55 helped me a lot now I use extensive reading
00:05:58 to improve to improve my
00:06:01 Japanese I speak Japanese  well I know how to
00:06:05 speak it well but there are many words
00:06:07 words used in literature abused
00:06:11 in books that I still don't know very well and
00:06:14 with extensive reading you can improve
00:06:16 improve that then to extensive reading
00:06:22 I met her I met her because there is a
00:06:25 school in Japan that uses it there is a
00:06:27 school in japan where they teach
00:06:31 children english children are taught english
00:06:34 and in japan in japan there are not many people
00:06:38 who speak english well but in this
00:06:41 school they have been very successful in this
00:06:44 school the children have learned a lot they
00:06:46 have improved a lot using extensive reading
00:06:51 and what they do in this school is have
00:06:54 a list each child each child the books
00:06:58 they read write them down on a list they write down
00:07:01 how many words each book has
00:07:05 they add up they add up words they
00:07:08 have a goal they have a goal and the
00:07:12 first goal the first goal to
00:07:15 reach to reach is a million
00:07:19 words if a million one followed by 660
00:07:24 a million
00:07:25 and me with Japanese I've finished I've reached
00:07:30 my goal that's the  first objective and
00:07:33 you can do it too you
00:07:36 can read books look at each book you
00:07:39 read how many words how many words it
00:07:41 has and add them up and so you can see you can
00:07:45 see 5% or 20% you can see how much you have
00:07:50 left to reach your objective
00:07:53 and in this school in  this school in
00:07:56 japan what they have seen their experience is
00:08:00 that when children read 3
00:08:04 million 3 million words they read
00:08:07 books
00:08:09 for a total of 3 million words
00:08:11 so their level is already very good their
00:08:15 level already allows them to read everything read
00:08:18 any  book with that level of 3
00:08:21 million words and right now
00:08:23 with the Japanese that I am
00:08:26 trying to reach that level of having
00:08:29 read 3 million words and something
00:08:34 very important  It is important because in this school in
00:08:36 Japan they have many students they have
00:08:39 many students and one very
00:08:41 important thing they have seen is that the
00:08:44 students who go faster the students
00:08:47 who improve their level faster are the ones
00:08:50 who read books that they understand very well
00:08:53 read books that they understand  more than 95%
00:09:00 95% 95
00:09:03 means that perhaps there is perhaps one
00:09:07 word in 20 that they do not understand a
00:09:10 word in 20 that they do not yet know

00:09:50 words out of 20 you already know them you already

00:00:29 work because  we are on a
00:00:32 relatively small island but still there are
00:00:34 many things It seems that it will be a
00:00:37 long journey ok there are provisions
00:00:43 there What else is there a sign
00:00:46 prohibited parking ships or
00:00:49 spectral demonic motorcycles or zombies on

00:01:27 going to find it.
00:01:36 Able to
00:01:37 sell us on Madison, right? I think I
00:01:40 needed to take the pressure off her in another
00:01:41 way,
00:01:43 okay?
00:02:02 It's like a unit, it's not that
00:02:05 little piratical,
00:02:07 focus is okay Hello, how come I know it,
00:02:11 it's hard to believe that after so many
00:02:13 years you're still here,
00:02:16 I've been declared a historical figure,
00:02:20 this place doesn't look like I
00:02:22 remember it, I'm going to find the secret,
00:02:24 tell me something about it  loom Well I
00:02:27 wonder if he's coming
00:02:28 you're coming
00:02:31 I've heard that the secret is nothing more than an
00:02:34 advertising claim that only
00:02:37 the deluded and naive would go looking for it
00:02:41 okay
00:02:42 What is it tell me something about him
00:02:47 I'm sick of pirates
00:02:49 asking me about
00:02:51 light  get lost
00:02:54 okay it's been a pleasure it doesn't seem like I
00:02:57 have
00:03:00 anything to interest me interesting to tell me yes yes okay there is
00:03:04 a stupid painting it's those three clowns
00:03:06 at the dinner table
00:03:12 I'm going to look in
00:03:15 the kitchen
00:03:17 to see if there's a mop Guy Blast, what a
00:03:20 pleasant surprise. How are you?
00:03:31 favorite also paid your bill when
00:03:33 you stopped coming
00:03:35 ok
00:03:37 follow the administration I messed up on
00:03:40 our anniversary we are further
00:03:42 apart than I would like we are
00:03:44 further apart than I would like
00:03:49 but you
00:03:51 continue today yes we continue we just that
00:03:55 we are very busy is a relationship  It's a
00:03:56 lot of trouble, very busy. Well, my health,
00:04:02 buy a mop. Let's see, do you know where
00:04:06 I can buy a mop?
00:04:09 Buy it. Don't buy a mop. You're a
00:04:12 pirate because you're going to buy a mop.
00:04:20 As abject as a scourer, a
00:04:23 noble tool for a more civilized cleaning,
00:04:25 also a Spanish invention, you will never
00:04:28 succeed with someone else's mop.
00:04:31 or
00:04:33 you have to make your own a
00:04:35 perfect utensil that you will keep and
00:04:37 use all your life wow man I have
00:04:39 to make my own mop
00:04:42 once I make it for you it is a mop it
00:04:44 will be your faithful companion your tool and
00:04:48 a means of defense against any
00:04:49 dirt you have to defend yourself against  society
00:04:53 I have made it I can't steal it I'm a
00:04:57 pirate I can steal
00:05:00 things wood is the heart of the stick
00:05:03 Heart is the cooks stick you are
00:05:07 only one it is very philosophical all this
00:05:09 none of it helps me you must find a
00:05:11 certain tree one especially suitable
00:05:14 for  make mop sticks
00:05:16 carve your stick And from a branch of
00:05:18 that tree
00:05:23 any questions
00:05:29 like that the head for Look for ask
00:05:34 What about the head of the mop head
00:05:37 Oh you need one like that But almost
00:05:40 anything is worth the stick is what  take
00:05:42 it seriously
00:05:44 I don't know if taking it seriously I should
00:05:47 take it seriously this
00:05:49 man what wood the tree
00:05:53 is made of that is something you have to find out for yourself
00:05:58 when you do it  find out you will know that it
00:06:01 has always been inside you that you
00:06:03 have always known
00:06:05 I am going to ignore it for now If
00:06:08 I need more information then what's up
00:06:11 you have mistitled the story It should be
00:06:14 in search of the mop
00:06:17 When we get to the pirate action
00:06:20 even in the  coolest professions you have
00:06:23 to scrub more than you imagine It
00:06:26 seemed crazy to me too but don't
00:06:28 forget that it was all to get on a
00:06:29 ship take command and Sail
00:06:31 to Monkey Island But first I had to
00:06:34 mop myself
00:06:39 Get away from me  mop I can't steal the
00:06:43 mop it's not a mop of course
00:06:49 worms how active these bugs are
00:06:53 eh Let's see I
00:06:57 remember that as if it were yesterday
00:07:01 The stove Come closer pleasantly scorching
00:07:06 things that are disgusting well rancid food
00:07:10 good for now I'm going out here to
00:07:14 see what there is a wooden seagull on the
00:07:17 plaque it commemorates the seagulls of
00:07:19 remote looms
00:07:21 there is a rope I think someone tried to
00:07:25 tie a boat with this good take a
00:07:27 rope ah  Now I have a piece of string
00:07:30 I can untangle it, it won't untangle, okay,
00:07:39 I'm just going to leave the door open
00:07:42 here, a relative
00:07:46 looks like a mug shot,
00:07:49 okay,
00:07:51 I don't know if they'll tell me differently,
00:07:53 I'm sure I can't convince you to finance
00:07:55 my expedition to Monkey Island,
00:07:58 let's suppose  I wonder what
00:08:00 skills you have exactly
00:08:03 I completed all three tests although the
00:08:06 three tests they have already said that they do
00:08:08 n't care much about
00:08:10 the ghost
00:08:12 surrounding you the chat I defeated
00:08:15 Chuck's ghost pirate
00:08:17 several times it's
00:08:19 ironic that sailing with him is
00:08:22 your only option  to go to Monkey Island
00:08:23 If I already know, then I was director
00:08:27 of combat operations for the
00:08:28 British navy and wrote two books on
00:08:30 nautical tactics I am the same founder
00:08:33 and director of the red fleet with a
00:08:35 record of civilian casualties in Santo Domingo
00:08:37 de Santo Domingo  Venezuela I am
00:08:39 an expert in 17 forms of hand-to-hand combat
00:08:41 3 invented by me I served with
00:08:44 melami tips and Roberts before they
00:08:47 suffered a mu  A premature death
00:08:49 that I had nothing to do with so
00:08:51 you know. This is the level we're waiting for. It's
00:08:56 okay. I think that defeating when kicking out
00:08:59 is also quite good. But hey,
00:09:02 let's go explore the city a little bit.
00:09:07 go to the
00:09:10 street
00:09:12 that is in the street is the Statue the
00:09:15 bad thing about this statue is that it is not from
00:09:16 Element it is the best governor of scrum
00:09:19 it is not law
00:09:23 There is nothing here the note has already looked at it they are
00:09:27 going to close authentic
00:09:31 voodoo voodoo  they sell must be authentic and
00:09:33 culturally and historically accurate it
00:09:35 says it on the sign it says authentic they are going to
00:09:38 close next csd of business this place
00:09:41 is an institution they are going to close the
00:09:44 shop Looks like it has been here
00:09:46 before goats to the international house of
00:09:49 mojo this place  It hasn't changed in years
00:09:58 what a joy to see you here
00:10:01 I've been waiting
00:10:05 to see you It's been years I'm going to look for the
00:10:07 secret of Monkey Island
00:10:09 I'm thinking of
00:10:12 navigating with the chats Reckless but it's
00:10:16 what you should do Well more
00:10:17 confirmation that I have to get on your
00:10:19 ship allows me to request wisdom from
00:10:21 you It will cost me something
00:10:24 pride free will almost nothing and see
00:10:28 will is like freedom of action no
00:10:33 the path to the secret is like a
00:10:35 snake that bites its tail has
00:10:38 many  obstacles
00:10:39 snake obstacles understood
00:10:44 a snake that bites its tail
00:10:45 has obstacles
00:10:48 you must walk the path Although you already
00:10:51 did it And now I'm going back
00:11:00 he gave me a book when you have doubts
00:11:02 to move forward this book will guide you on
00:11:05 what is to come but it tells the
00:11:07 future
00:11:09 in a way consider it a
00:11:11 clue book What is really
00:11:15 a clue book
00:11:18 use it wisely know too dwindle
00:11:22 to the journey make the journey

00:11:45 costume what a cool symbol What does a
00:11:49 mean  It used to contain magical costumes but

00:11:56 Exactly, what a pity that a
00:11:58 magical costume is out of stock, I think it's something very useful. There
00:11:59 is always the famous Johnnie patch
00:12:03 in the Museum, I'm sure it no longer has
00:12:05 magic left  but i think i could restore

00:15:19 hacking is changing and giving way to
00:15:22 black magic voodoo is fun And so on
00:15:24 But it's not what the new
00:15:26 generation wants  I'm ashamed at the
00:15:29 forefront and earning a fortune I'm
00:15:31 about to set up a franchise okay
00:15:35 the town seems to be going down ever
00:15:39 since Captain Madison
00:15:41 dembélé her base d  e ops
00:15:43 people have been complaining they say he's a
00:15:46 bad influence on the town but that
00:15:48 bad influence is spending a
00:15:51 lot of money on maps So he's good enough for him
00:15:53 so what do you want him to do
00:15:56 do the right thing instead of trying to make you
00:15:58 rich  that's what i do right for
00:16:01 wally the right thing for myself
00:16:04 ok bye

00:16:29 boxer short shape
00:16:32 those stairs suspicious to a window
00:16:35 Hey Wally what is this window ladder for I
00:16:38 use it to keep an eye on the
00:16:42 neighbors anyway It's good to have a hobby it's
00:16:46 worth
00:16:51 the high street Look at the graffiti even
00:16:54 in the soup What kind of person would paint
00:16:56 something like that on a wall well maybe it's
00:16:59 a clue  this looks like the symbol of
00:17:02 anarchy but like that on the side no
00:17:05 other graffiti was on i would never have
00:17:08 tolerated this when i ruled
00:17:11 this place it has gone bad ok
00:17:14 then I need the splinter not a
00:17:18 splinter a piece of wood from the tree
00:17:21 Meanwhile on the right boat

00:18:26 be terrorizing the seven seas
00:18:28 spreading terror wreaking havoc
00:18:31 something more chat style I'm sick of

00:00:33 [Music]
00:00:36 ah
00:00:37 hello well this web series is what a
00:00:42 sad life what a sad life because the
00:00:46 character the protagonist of the story
00:00:50 well has a life a bit a bit
00:00:53 sad no and it's a web series a web series
00:00:58 with episodes  quite short and this
00:01:02 series became very popular when I
00:01:05 was at university when I
00:01:08 was studying at university in
00:01:12 2006 in 2006 is when it appeared when
00:01:16 this series began and in 2006 I don't know I don't know
00:01:21 if YouTube already existed or not but this
00:01:26 series had  its website had its own website
00:01:28 it was not on youtube and well in 2006 it
00:01:33 was when online video was beginning video on the
00:01:35 internet was
00:01:38 beginning there was very little very little
00:01:40 video on the internet  et
00:01:42 is a series about two friends two friends
00:01:46 two boys two basque boys two boys
00:01:50 from the basque country in the north of spain and
00:01:54 well above all about borja borja is the
00:01:57 name of the protagonist of the main
00:02:00 character of this series and borja talks about
00:02:04 his life he talks about  everything in his life about
00:02:07 the things that happen to him he talks about his friend he
00:02:11 talks about his girlfriend he talks about
00:02:14 his friend's girlfriend that he doesn't like very much he doesn't
00:02:17 like him very much he
00:02:18 talks about his work he works on a tow truck
00:02:25 carrying a tow truck driving a tow truck he
00:02:28 talks  videogames he likes
00:02:31 videogames above all he likes fifa
00:02:34 he likes to play fifa the
00:02:36 soccer game and he likes
00:02:40 bruce willis movies he likes the actor bruce
00:02:43 willis and well i think the series is very
00:02:46 funny the series is funny the
00:02:49 videos
00:02:51 They are very funny, the
00:02:54 way Borja talks, how he communicates, and the
00:02:58 things he thinks and the things he does
00:03:00 are very funny, and many things are
00:03:04 everyday things, things from real life, and
00:03:07 I think that people love  We Spaniards
00:03:10 liked it because we can identify
00:03:13 with many things, there are many things that
00:03:17 Borja does that are not perfect or
00:03:20 even not very good, but that we
00:03:23 identify with that many Spaniards
00:03:26 did or have done
00:03:29 and we can identify quite a bit with
00:03:32 those things
00:03:34 and this series is not  Let
00:03:37 's see, it's a series for Spaniards,
00:03:40 so it's not very, very easy to
00:03:43 understand, but I don't think it's one of the
00:03:46 most difficult series. I think you do
00:03:50 need an
00:03:52 intermediate-high level, perhaps, but well, try and
00:03:56 try to watch this series and tell
00:03:59 me, tell me  If it seems easy to you, it seems
00:04:01 difficult to you,
00:04:02 the Spanish they use, the vocabulary they
00:04:05 use is very colloquial Spanish,
00:04:08 very everyday Spanish, very real Spanish that
00:04:12 the Spanish really use and the
00:04:14 videos. Most of the videos are
00:04:17 recorded in his flat, he records them in his flat.
00:04:20 in his room where he lives and well
00:04:23 they became very famous they became so
00:04:25 famous that they were broadcast on television they
00:04:29 also made a contract  a contract
00:04:33 to make new episodes for
00:04:35 television and between 2008 and 2010 they were
00:04:40 broadcast on television it was on
00:04:42 television in Spain' they
00:04:44 made new episodes for television and
00:04:47 well that's it the series lasted from 2006 to
00:04:51 2010 but now you can still see the
00:04:55 episodes you can  watch online and

177,"00:00:00 Hi guys, once again I am Mexican
00:00:03 here talking to you how to
00:00:05 install today I hope you are very
00:00:07 well and what you think today we bring a
00:00:10 little historical topic a little more
00:00:14 information that I want to share with
00:00:16 you so that you can also learn a
00:00:18 little about  what is Mexican culture
00:00:20 and some things that are important and that
00:00:23 is why today we are going to talk about
00:00:25 the indigenous languages ​​of mexico and in
00:00:29 mexico and that is why we are going to do it
00:00:34 [Music]
00:00:37 well guys if we talk about indigenous languages
00:00:40 in mexico  We have to understand
00:00:42 that this refers to this because it has
00:00:46 been the languages ​​or languages ​​ok
00:00:52 that are spoken in this
00:00:54 Mexican territory the different ways of
00:00:56 speaking and we have to begin to know that
00:00:59 in Mexico there are different cultures
00:01:02 different languages ​​ok and that there is a
00:01:06 enormous diversity, that is, there is a lot of
00:01:09 variety and around history, well
00:01:13 , throughout history, which is
00:01:14 great, sometimes we do not know how
00:01:17 great this history is.  We also have to
00:01:20 understand that they have discovered more
00:01:24 or less 350 indigenous languages, that is,
00:01:30 other variant languages,
00:01:33 different ways of speaking and studies have said
00:01:37 this, so
00:01:40 today there are 69 languages.
00:01:51 There are 69 languages ​​of which
00:01:56 360 variants have been found. What do I
00:02:01 mean by this, it may be that
00:02:04 there is a language but from there
00:02:06 another language is derived or comes out because it has different accents,
00:02:10 the intonation is different,
00:02:14 yes, or it can change completely as if
00:02:17 we were speaking.  from Spanish and English these
00:02:19 are two different languages ​​but since
00:02:23 other types of variant languages ​​can come out of them
00:02:26 that are changing and are
00:02:29 considered as variants or
00:02:31 different ways of speaking in order
00:02:34 to understand these numbers a little better,
00:02:36 we are going to know that of the 69
00:02:40 languages ​​of  the languages ​​that I am speaking to you are
00:02:42 ok,
00:02:44 68 languages ​​are indigenous and well, the one that is
00:02:48 missing to make it 69 is Spanish,
00:02:52 so  in mexico there are today 69
00:02:56 indigenous languages ​​and spanish
00:03:00 ok 68 indigenous languages ​​and spanish 69
00:03:04 in total 68 indigenous languages ​​and one more
00:03:09 that is spanish so that they give the 69
00:03:11 for and admittedly i really like
00:03:16 knowing this because i know that in  In general,
00:03:20 my country is very rich, each country has its
00:03:24 own. My country, Mexico, is very rich
00:03:27 in, well, in culture
00:03:30 and thanks to this and all the history
00:03:33 that Mexico has lived through,
00:03:36 we can say that we are from the ten
00:03:39 nations or from the  ten countries where there
00:03:45 is a greater variety of
00:03:48 native languages ​​languages ​​know how to see it is the
00:03:51 largest of the ten countries where there are
00:03:56 these this diversity different languages ​​well
00:04:01 you will not believe it but we rank
00:04:03 second on this list of 10
00:04:06 countries we rank second  place and
00:04:10 then the first place is occupied by Brazil
00:04:14 what a coincidence, don't you know that
00:04:17 I am here in Brazil right now and
00:04:20 that is also good to know that
00:04:24 Brazil where I am occupies the first place  Gar
00:04:26 and Mexico are in second place but it is very
00:04:29 good even so in Latin America it is
00:04:32 incredible incredible well speaking of the
00:04:35 history of these languages
00:04:38 we know that studies have done that well
00:04:41 science not history tells us
00:04:45 that they existed around the 18th century they
00:04:49 existed more  Of 100 languages ​​spoken in
00:04:53 Mexico right
00:04:54 now we are talking about 69 languages,
00:04:56 already with Spanish and beforehand, imagine 100
00:05:01 languages, how complicated that must be,
00:05:05 because it was then that more or less
00:05:07 after the independence of
00:05:11 Mexico many indigenous peoples already
00:05:13 had  You have to know how to speak Spanish,
00:05:18 understand Spanish to be able to communicate and not
00:05:21 have this language barrier, because if
00:05:24 there is a language barrier,
00:05:27 you can't understand people,
00:05:29 that's why the indigenous peoples had
00:05:31 to start
00:05:33 learning, okay, but that doesn't end there.
00:05:38 By the 20th century it was the only
00:05:42 language taught, only Spanish was taught
00:05:46 and only this teaching was for the
00:05:50 indigenous  because their
00:05:54 objective was for them to learn to speak
00:05:56 Spanish and learn to write and
00:06:00 then also read and other things
00:06:03 to have a knowledge of this
00:06:07 language and be able to communicate with other
00:06:09 people but as I was saying this there
00:06:13 was no other way for these people
00:06:16 indigenous people had no choice but to
00:06:18 learn to learn because they had to
00:06:21 learn like when they take us to school when we are
00:06:23 little, well they take you by
00:06:26 force, when I say by force it is that
00:06:29 you don't want to go to school or maybe you
00:06:31 do, but most of  The children do not
00:06:34 want to go to school and when they go
00:06:36 to school it is because their parents
00:06:38 force them to go to school no and it is more or
00:06:40 less this happened but a little more
00:06:43 aggressive with these indigenous peoples and
00:06:47 that was in mexico when they arrive  the
00:06:51 conquistadors, which was the arrival of the
00:06:53 conquistadors in Mexico, because this began
00:06:58 to happen as a result of some
00:07:02 shipwrecked people who came in some ships
00:07:06 or some ships of the co  nquistadores,
00:07:08 some ships of people
00:07:12 from Europe, okay,
00:07:15 these people, given the history that two
00:07:18 people who were shipwrecked arrived on
00:07:21 these islands or this island or this land
00:07:25 not called New Spain or well-
00:07:27 known Mexico today,
00:07:30 these two people well began to
00:07:33 understand this these new languages ​​for
00:07:37 them and then one of those people of
00:07:41 the two characters we find that according to
00:07:43 the story says that Jerónimo de Aguilar
00:07:46 was one of the people who came to
00:07:49 this island or from this to this land and
00:07:53 later on in  history
00:07:56 becomes the interpreter of hernán
00:07:59 cortés and we know that hernán cortez well
00:08:04 if you don't know hernán cortez was a
00:08:07 person who became a
00:08:09 conquistador who came from another place to
00:08:12 conquer the lands of
00:08:16 new spain or mexico not then
00:08:20 Since the arrival of these people here,
00:08:24 New Spain to Mexico,
00:08:28 these people had the objective of
00:08:33 making these indigenous peoples
00:08:36 they understood, well,
00:08:38 they acquired Spanish,
00:08:41 Castilian for them as a language
00:08:44 so the people who were in charge
00:08:46 of doing this were often the
00:08:49 missionaries the missionaries were people
00:08:51 who entered these
00:08:54 groups like ok we have a group here we are not
00:08:57 going to give a great example  with these
00:09:00 markers we have a group here this
00:09:04 group speaks a language then the
00:09:06 missionary arrives and the missionary enters the
00:09:10 group here and begins to study he begins to
00:09:13 study well the language that was spoken
00:09:18 in that place and he begins to study he
00:09:21 begins to study and then that
00:09:23 The missionary has the mission of
00:09:28 evangelizing these groups, that is, once again we
00:09:32 find religion, these
00:09:35 missionaries also had the objective of
00:09:39 giving or imposing this religion on a
00:09:45 Catholic Christian religion, you
00:09:48 know how all this
00:09:50 religion came to put these ideas
00:09:53 into the  indigenous to these people who
00:09:57 lived in new spain in mexico and
00:09:59 because they wanted to do this evidently  Before
00:10:02 it was because they wanted their riches they
00:10:05 wanted their goods the things that
00:10:08 they belonged to them because they came
00:10:10 from outside they came from another side and
00:10:13 came to conquer the lands to take
00:10:16 everything but if they killed them all well
00:10:19 they were not going to know how  treat
00:10:21 the land or they would not know the
00:10:24 special magical things that these indigenous people
00:10:27 knew how to do then that they had to
00:10:30 do by force, just like when a child
00:10:33 goes to school they
00:10:35 had to make them speak
00:10:36 Spanish than speak Spanish and
00:10:39 only with the benefit of being able
00:10:41 control this group of people
00:10:44 control driving and thus make them
00:10:49 do what these people wanted
00:10:52 ok it's so cold it's not like
00:10:57 when a child goes to school it's a bit
00:10:58 ugly but well that's how the
00:11:02 story went and that's why I entered  1900 and
00:11:08 2000 and the year 2000, since practically
00:11:12 all the indigenous peoples were
00:11:15 already already all spoke Spanish and they
00:11:18 were all with this religion in the güero it
00:11:22 was quite a show for the  It's like something
00:11:24 sad but this was the dream of the
00:11:26 conquerors
00:11:28 and it was achieved and whoever didn't felt like I
00:11:31 don't want I don't want I want my
00:11:33 indigenous language I want my
00:11:34 indigenous language they came to kill something a
00:11:37 little more bloody they used them as
00:11:39 slaves, some no, but some who
00:11:43 said no, I don't want to, they killed them, they
00:11:45 are slaves, and they began to impose
00:11:49 or give them customs that they also
00:11:50 had there in Europe, and well, guys,
00:11:54 after so much sadness from all this,
00:11:56 what is sad to me, always
00:11:58 this  Religion, religions in general,
00:12:00 is kind of ugly because they always go against
00:12:03 the human being, I think, I think,
00:12:07 and speaking of numbers, we are going to talk about
00:12:10 numbers that today it is estimated that 7
00:12:13 million Mexican men and women speak
00:12:15 an indigenous language. We are talking about
00:12:19 many many people that
00:12:21 perhaps we would think that over the years
00:12:24 this number of speaking people has been
00:12:27 reduced and yes it has been reduced but
00:12:30 we still have people  so that they speak languages ​​well
00:12:34 these languages ​​these indigenous languages ​​and it
00:12:37 was then in recent 2015 that a
00:12:42 group called inegi which is the
00:12:44 national institute of statistics and geography here
00:12:47 in mexico is a group that is dedicated to
00:12:49 conducting surveys remember that every
00:12:52 year always everyone  Over the years they do
00:12:54 surveys to find out how many people
00:12:57 serve in your house and in 2015 they
00:13:00 did another survey in
00:13:03 Mexico City and they discovered that 8 million ok
00:13:08 8 million people
00:13:10 almost 9 million people who live in
00:13:14 Mexico cities of that one of those 8
00:13:19 million us 8 million people
00:13:22 8 percent describe themselves or say
00:13:25 they are indigenous perhaps they do not speak the
00:13:29 language but their ancestors were
00:13:31 indigenous so they also say
00:13:34 I am indigenous no and more or less that 8.8
00:13:38 percent would be like 700 700 thousand almost
00:13:43 800  thousand people who say they are
00:13:47 indigenous or who describe themselves as
00:13:50 saying they are indigenous, then
00:13:54 we will know that from that total that
00:13:56 we are talking about people  As in
00:13:58 Mexico City there are
00:13:59 129,000 more or less approximately
00:14:04 the people who speak this
00:14:06 indigenous language, as I was saying, there are 700,000
00:14:10 people who say they are
00:14:13 indigenous, but of those 700,000 only
00:14:17 almost 130,000 speak an indigenous language,
00:14:22 surely they have ancestors who
00:14:25 They came from these indigenous languages
00:14:27 that used to be indigenous but
00:14:30 they don't speak them anymore so that's why the
00:14:32 number of 130,000 people who
00:14:37 really speak in Mexico City
00:14:40 doesn't and something else like that super super cool
00:14:44 super important and I would like them to
00:14:47 They knew is that they remember that I told them
00:14:49 at the beginning that there are 68 ok
00:14:53 indigenous languages ​​because Spanish is 69 but
00:14:56 68 of those 68 indigenous languages ​​in
00:15:00 Mexico City are spoken 55, that is, a
00:15:04 lot
00:15:06 and it is incredible that
00:15:08 all this continues to exist in me  opinion but
00:15:11 if we talk about the entire country of all of
00:15:13 mexico seven million seven
00:15:18 million people speak an
00:15:20 indigenous language ok and of these seven million
00:15:24 p  Well, 25 million recognized themselves as
00:15:29 indigenous, maybe they don't speak the language
00:15:30 as I told them, but they say that well, they
00:15:34 have ancestors who came to do well,
00:15:37 indigenous, so we have people
00:15:41 who claim to be indigenous but who don't
00:15:43 speak the language, so well, there it is
00:15:46 more or less and  Of these people who
00:15:49 speak the language, we will always
00:15:51 find mostly the speakers in
00:15:53 the south, ok, in the south of the country, that is,
00:15:57 downwards, downwards, towards Brazil, towards here
00:16:00 where I am,
00:16:02 if we go up towards the north,
00:16:05 we will find another type  Tonada,
00:16:08 another type of Mexico, another type of Spanish, you
00:16:11 know, we are going to find different
00:16:14 variants, not like the variants
00:16:17 that other languages ​​have had. If we
00:16:19 go further north of the country, we are going to
00:16:22 find people who speak this language
00:16:25 or indigenous languages, but mostly  They are
00:16:29 concentrated below in the south of the country and
00:16:34 above if we approach when
00:16:36 I have gone to the north of the country you always
00:16:39 meet people who  They
00:16:43 speak Spanish, which is this language, which is
00:16:45 like a mix, a mixture between Spanish
00:16:50 and English, no, but they hardly speak
00:16:53 any indigenous language, if there are people,
00:16:56 but mostly it is Spanglish or
00:16:59 Spanish is like that, and well, which one is it?  the language
00:17:03 that is spoken the most in mexico
00:17:06 we are going to begin to understand that
00:17:09 in mexico it does not exist as a language so
00:17:13 this is the language that has to be
00:17:15 spoken in mexico that is why
00:17:18 over time
00:17:21 it has been established that the 69  languages, that
00:17:25 is, 68 indigenous languages ​​and Spanish have
00:17:29 been established as non-official languages,
00:17:34 but they are recognized
00:17:36 in Mexico and are respected, they have the
00:17:38 same value if you speak an indigenous language other
00:17:40 than Spanish, you have the same
00:17:42 value before society, it should be like that, I
00:17:44 don't know  It supposes that this is how it should be and, well,
00:17:48 obviously, if the question is what is
00:17:51 the language or the language that is most spoken
00:17:53 in Mexico, yes, it is Spanish, but the
00:17:57 other 68 indigenous languages ​​are also
00:17:59 well respected, and well,
00:18:01 yes, but  Well, the
00:18:04 percentage of people who speak
00:18:07 indigenous languages ​​here in Mexico is very low, although it is a
00:18:10 good number, but for all the people who
00:18:12 live in Mexico, if it is a small number,
00:18:14 then of those 68
00:18:18 indigenous languages, which
00:18:20 ones stand out the most?  They are the most important
00:18:22 of those 68,
00:18:25 since there are 3, it is worth that they are Lago Tin,
00:18:29 Maya and Mixtec. Those are the three
00:18:32 languages ​​that are the most widely spoken and well,
00:18:36 first of all we have
00:18:40 Nahuatl and then Maya and
00:18:43 after Mixtec and  others others there are
00:18:46 other languages ​​that are in danger of
00:18:50 extinction with many things here in this
00:18:53 society but of the languages ​​that are one
00:18:56 of the languages ​​that is in danger
00:18:57 of ending extinction and that there is
00:19:00 no more speaker is Zapotec that
00:19:03 is in the  list well well below
00:19:06 that surely unfortunately it
00:19:09 can disappear due to all this that
00:19:13 is well in this world not but we are going to
00:19:16 talk right now about the Mayan
00:19:18 language the Mayan language is mostly spoken  ada this
00:19:22 is the second place ok this is
00:19:24 mostly spoken in the south
00:19:27 if it is spoken sorry in the in the south if it is
00:19:30 spoken mostly well in the whole country
00:19:32 but
00:19:33 the group of people who speak
00:19:36 this language the most this language goes to the
00:19:39 south to  below ok and it is also spoken in
00:19:43 places like yucatan and campeche
00:19:46 quintana roo among others that are many
00:19:49 states but in the states of mexico
00:19:51 these are where these speakers are mostly found
00:19:53 as i told you
00:19:56 there are many variants of these of
00:19:59 these languages
00:20:01 and maya one  One of the variants of the Maya
00:20:05 is the Yucatec Maya, which by region
00:20:08 will always change the language a lot or
00:20:11 a little, but they can tell you a variant
00:20:14 of the Maya, a variant of Nahuatl, a variant
00:20:17 of Zapotec, you know, and it is one of
00:20:21 those places
00:20:23 in Yucatan, it is one of those  places where
00:20:25 this Yucatec Maya is spoken
00:20:28 in 2012 said that there were, according to
00:20:35 studies, there were 800,000
00:20:39 Mayan speakers 800,000 Mayan speakers, that is, it is
00:20:42 a fairly large number, but  That was
00:20:45 in 2012. Let's hope that right now it
00:20:48 hasn't decreased much, although I know that
00:20:50 as the years go by these things are
00:20:55 having much fewer speakers
00:21:00 and, well, the cool thing or the exciting thing about
00:21:04 this language is that this language has a
00:21:08 lack  In other words, it does not exist, it does not have
00:21:11 the letters of g, efe
00:21:15 and r. These four letters are not
00:21:18 used in the alphabet or in the
00:21:21 daily life of this Mayan language, and yes, they are
00:21:25 letters that they use and their
00:21:27 alphabet has 24 letters, obviously that
00:21:32 at  Over the years, as with everything,
00:21:35 this language has also evolved a lot,
00:21:37 so we can find a
00:21:39 difference between the Mayan language that was
00:21:42 used 200 years ago and the Mayan language
00:21:45 of today, such as Spanish or
00:21:49 English, as they know, there have been
00:21:52 variants as well and  things have changed
00:21:54 we are going to learn a word of this
00:21:58 maya we are going to learn like this and
00:22:01 I am going to read it because I am not a speaker
00:22:04 of this language so I do not want to lose
00:22:06 a single letter
00:22:08 mick ave or vix abel beats abel opinion
00:22:12 is like these opinion
00:22:17 and now we are going to talk about the
00:22:19 language number 1 which is Nahuatl and
00:22:22 Nagua if you look closely this is like
00:22:26 water I really like that feeling
00:22:28 try it Nahuat and it's great  not many
00:22:32 people can do it but it's a good father
00:22:34 this language is mainly spoken
00:22:37 by nahuatl speakers the nahuatl well
00:22:40 it's these people who speak it's
00:22:42 the nahuas it's these people who speak
00:22:45 this language and it's well found in
00:22:48 puebla in veracruz in oaxaca in durango
00:22:51 yes  Look at this state, which is
00:22:56 called Durango, it is to the north if there
00:22:58 are people who speak this to the
00:23:00 north, but as the one of the
00:23:03 most widely spoken indigenous languages ​​in Mexico says,
00:23:06 we found that there will be a greater
00:23:08 variety of speakers throughout  of this
00:23:11 country, not in Mexico,
00:23:14 although, well, most of it is found
00:23:17 more below than above Mexico,
00:23:18 but even so, we continue to find it, and
00:23:21 also in Mexico City, this is spoken a
00:23:23 lot.  this language well now I
00:23:28 am going to tell you how this language is known
00:23:32 this language in water which is known as
00:23:35 the Mexican language in the past it used to be
00:23:39 called that way I am going to read it because if not
00:23:42 this is not going to come out the name is too long
00:23:45 in the  In the past it was called as a
00:23:48 week water here that of the semar avocado
00:23:53 the awning is difficult it is difficult as you
00:23:55 saw it is difficult and that is why with the passage
00:23:57 of time they said no no this is very
00:23:59 difficult we are going to change it and they changed it
00:24:02 to this language that today in  day we know
00:24:05 how in water this is in water which
00:24:09 is known as the meaning can be
00:24:12 translated as the word of the universe
00:24:16 this is more or less what
00:24:17 the Nahuatl word means
00:24:20 obviously like any other
00:24:23 language when the conquerors
00:24:26 arrived and put this  Spanish this
00:24:29 Castilian to New Spain to Mexico
00:24:32 obviously they lost many
00:24:35 speakers in the water the Mayan the Zapotec
00:24:38 the all all the languages ​​lost
00:24:41 speakers that is people who spoke
00:24:43 this language  Uh no but the Europeans
00:24:47 wanted to retain this language
00:24:53 because they wanted to continue learning and they
00:24:56 wanted to continue conquering more
00:24:59 indigenous groups so they stayed with
00:25:02 this language a lot and that is why even today it is the
00:25:05 number one language, well Spanish and
00:25:07 then there is this Nahua language tweet  You know,
00:25:10 it's number one, it's still being used, there are
00:25:13 words that right now I'm going
00:25:15 to tell you that there are words that
00:25:17 we still use that come from
00:25:18 Nahuatl, but this is because the
00:25:20 conquistadors wanted to keep
00:25:22 these words with some things
00:25:24 to have a little more d
00:25:27 knowledge and there are words that they did not
00:25:29 have and that they used as the
00:25:31 words of water that are ok of these
00:25:34 variants because there are always variants
00:25:38 in the languages ​​and this is not the exception
00:25:40 there is also the Nahuatl of the sierra
00:25:43 the water of Oaxaca the lava tilde la
00:25:46 huasteca  potosina is a variety of
00:25:50 different variants that is
00:25:54 complicated but there are many variants of
00:25:57 the uatre ok  In NATO it is like in water and
00:26:00 then the water of Oaxaca on the web where they
00:26:03 populate waters where many variants
00:26:06 now we go with our participant the
00:26:09 third place goes to the Mixtecs
00:26:13 or the Mixtec language which is
00:26:17 well found in Oaxaca in Puebla and
00:26:20 Also in Guerrero
00:26:22 in 2010 and Mexico, which is this group that
00:26:25 is dedicated to conducting surveys and
00:26:27 statistics and so they said that there were
00:26:32 more or less there were or over 500,000
00:26:34 speakers of this language and the important thing
00:26:39 about this language is that it is the language with the
00:26:42 highest  number of variants, that is, 81
00:26:46 variants, this language has, but
00:26:48 we had little with which the water was
00:26:51 Nahuatl, Nahuatl, one from Oaxaca,
00:26:54 Nahuatl, Nahuatl from Puebla.
00:27:05 Well, many variants of
00:27:07 which these 81 variants exist: the
00:27:10 Mixtec of Guerrero, the Mixtec of the
00:27:13 Northeast, among others, and well, guys,
00:27:16 after knowing all this and a
00:27:18 little bit of history that happens
00:27:20 today with these languages, what
00:27:23 happens is that
00:27:25 the Mexican constitution, which is where they
00:27:27 exist, where the laws and
00:27:30 things that we should follow as
00:27:31 Mexicans have been written, there it was said that they were going to
00:27:36 do everything possible that  They are doing everything
00:27:39 possible so that these languages
00:27:42 are accepted and so that they are seen with
00:27:44 respect and all that and that is why
00:27:47 the national group of indigenous peoples has been created,
00:27:49 which is a national
00:27:51 institute where they try to respect the
00:27:55 differences to help these
00:27:56 indigenous people everything but evidently as
00:28:01 in everything there are still differences and not
00:28:04 only here we say we have in mexico
00:28:08 an expression that is here in china that is
00:28:10 here in brazil there in mexico there are in
00:28:14 europe
00:28:15 there in asia everywhere there are
00:28:17 still differences of all no
00:28:20 only by language for speaking a
00:28:24 language not specifically but well it's
00:28:28 about seeing
00:28:29 but there continues to be this indifference no
00:28:34 and these languages ​​as I saw  We have many
00:28:37 variants, so they can be somewhat or very
00:28:39 complex. It is not the same to say a
00:28:43 Spanish from Spain to a Spanish from Mexico. It
00:28:46 will be that we understand each other like Pablo and
00:28:49 I understand each other well, but there are times when
00:28:53 we have words that I say what
00:28:55 that means, not  I understood there are words
00:28:58 that we don't understand maybe because of the
00:29:00 context or the story or what he's
00:29:03 saying I'll understand but
00:29:05 maybe I won't know 100% of the
00:29:07 words he's going to use and he won't
00:29:10 know all of them  the words that I
00:29:12 could use and that is why there
00:29:17 are many variants in these
00:29:20 indigenous languages, such as accents, words and
00:29:23 expressions like I say, go out to the
00:29:26 room for me, etc. It is something that
00:29:29 exists that I do not know if I believe, but it could
00:29:31 be  a variant
00:29:33 is not something rare but these words that the
00:29:36 conquistadors adopted and that continue to
00:29:39 exist today are the following:
00:29:42 molcajete molcajete is comes from the
00:29:47 original word this word originates
00:29:50 from the water that  e that comes in water
00:29:53 you would say molt cats crowd I don't know I'm not
00:29:57 very good but this is it I think
00:30:01 everyone has seen it is like a stone its
00:30:04 meaning would be a container for stews
00:30:07 and this is a kitchen appliance that was
00:30:10 widely used for years and years  back and still
00:30:13 today this is still being used I have not
00:30:16 seen it in many places in my house we have
00:30:18 many houses in Mexico it is like a
00:30:21 stone and it has another small stone
00:30:23 where you crush you die it could be
00:30:28 sauces chiles tomatoes there is a
00:30:31 restaurant in mexico in my  a city that
00:30:34 I like very much and there they make the
00:30:37 sauces at the moment they
00:30:39 grind the tomatoes, the chilies,
00:30:42 all the onion and they make some
00:30:45 very delicious spikes, the richest sauces are made
00:30:48 on that special stone called a
00:30:50 molcajete, well, there are different things they do
00:30:52 there  uses but generally it is
00:30:55 for the kitchen that is used there is another
00:30:58 thing that is the petate pita which is a
00:31:01 word that follows because it comes from the
00:31:04 Nahuatl ok and from blue water it is derived
00:31:08 as peta  your duffel bag is now the
00:31:11 duffel bag and this is a woven material like a
00:31:15 little thing like this, a material woven like this
00:31:19 intertwined with the palm of
00:31:29 the palm tree
00:31:32 .  very funny because this
00:31:34 word is derived from or means to kick the
00:31:38 paw in mexico it means to kick the paw
00:31:43 and the verb for this would be petate arse
00:31:46 this ski expression lies petate or
00:31:49 we use this a lot but it comes it comes it
00:31:52 comes from this petate ok this in the
00:31:57 past the  ancestors used this
00:31:59 as if they were a step, a
00:32:04 report or a carpet or this mat
00:32:08 to exercise in the gym or
00:32:10 so imagine something like that but made of
00:32:13 palm tree and they used this mat
00:32:16 as a camera it was their bed and it is supposed that
00:32:22 their  duffel bag that you used since you were born
00:32:25 in the duffel bag that you were going to use
00:32:27 until you died
00:32:30 maple duffel bag means to kick the bucket,
00:32:34 that is, to die then when
00:32:38 people died  they wrapped themselves up
00:32:42 in this petit duffel bag not the tactile pe in
00:32:47 Nahuat he is imagine that it is the
00:32:50 baseball player the person always slept in his
00:32:53 duffel bag ok
00:32:54 he always slept if this person died
00:32:57 they were supposed to roll him up in his duffel bag
00:33:02 and he went to consult  They buried the tomb
00:33:06 with the petate and other
00:33:08 things, but it was more or less like that, the
00:33:10 idea they had then was like
00:33:12 kicking the petate and well, we have
00:33:16 continued to have other words such
00:33:18 as skiing, which is a corn snack.
00:33:21 a a a mix that they make with grains of
00:33:26 corn that is still being sold in
00:33:28 Mexico they are great lots you know and
00:33:32 apapachar also avocado avocado and
00:33:36 I am going to tell you but it means testicle
00:33:39 and this word well also comes from
00:33:41 Nahuatl which is avocado that is avocado
00:33:46 we have  the chocolate obviously the
00:33:49 cigarette and all that and well if you look closely
00:33:52 we still have words that are from
00:33:55 these languages ​​although I don't speak
00:33:58 any indigenous language but I do have
00:34:01 these words  ras in my day to day and I use them
00:34:04 and these words come from the history
00:34:06 of my ancestors
00:34:08 how good in my experience when I
00:34:12 travel to the south of the country I always find
00:34:15 people who speak languages ​​I don't know how to
00:34:18 tell you well that person is speaking
00:34:20 Nahuat and that person  He's speaking Mayan
00:34:23 I don't know but what I do know is that it's an
00:34:26 indigenous language since I don't know
00:34:28 it I can't understand ok but generally
00:34:32 the people who sell products like
00:34:35 bracelets rings necklaces make you
00:34:38 fake tattoos those people
00:34:41 are generally from
00:34:45 indigenous people  who speak some
00:34:49 indigenous language and generally those
00:34:51 people are the ones who are always
00:34:52 speaking
00:34:55 yes because you can walk in the center and
00:34:58 you will always hear someone who
00:34:59 is speaking another language that is not
00:35:01 Spanish or English and it is very interesting
00:35:05 once I had  a guide on a boat who
00:35:09 took us to learn many stories about
00:35:13 caves and mountains and he had
00:35:17 all the knowledge of what it was
00:35:19 So he was the one who spoke with
00:35:22 other people who spoke another
00:35:24 indigenous language and could help us, they gave us
00:35:27 food and gave us a house and so on, and
00:35:31 at school when I was younger,
00:35:33 indigenous people came to sell well,
00:35:36 blouses, shirts, things made  by hand and
00:35:40 that's incredible because they have
00:35:41 a culture of making things by hand, not
00:35:44 all of them are ok but they make things by hand and
00:35:47 I'm a fan of these things that they do
00:35:49 I love it and well guys this is all
00:35:52 for today the subject is a little long but
00:35:54 I think it was quite interesting,
00:35:56 what did you think, did you like it, now you know a
00:35:59 little more about the indigenous languages ​​in
00:36:01 Mexico, this was your Mexican, and see
00:36:05 you next time, take care bye
00:36:07 bye

183,"00:00:00 On this channel we teach Spanish with
00:00:04 comprehensible input and I have told you a
00:00:09 lot about comprehensible input but
00:00:14 I have never explained where it comes from how it
00:00:18 started what the story is today I am going to
00:00:24 explain the history and the current state
00:00:28 how it is now
00:00:30 if it is going well or is going  bad
00:00:36 [Music]
00:00:39 hello well yes I am going to explain the
00:00:44 history and current state of
00:00:48 comprehensible input first I am going to explain
00:00:53 a method in 1977 to tpr
00:01:01 james yesterday invented pr tea so
00:01:05 this was before the
00:01:11 expression comprehensible input existed not yet
00:01:14 It was called comprehensible input but
00:01:18 yesterday james invented a method to
00:01:23 teach children it is to teach children
00:01:27 it is taught by telling them to do things by
00:01:31 telling them child take the marker
00:01:36 walk see there come here orders are given
00:01:42 then it is a method that uses
00:01:45 comprehensible input
00:01:48 and in the same year
00:01:51 in the same year there
00:01:54 is the input hypothesis of steven crash
00:01:58 in also in 77 steven crash in
00:02:02 public his inputs and prosthetics in the
00:02:07 70s and the years  s 80 steven crash in
00:02:11 development comprehensible input theory
00:02:14 not in 1984 also based
00:02:21 on comprehensible input by nikko mason
00:02:25 creates extensive reading
00:02:28 to come
00:02:30 mason then from extensive and reading
00:02:33 too either extensive reading has been talked about
00:02:36 or it has been talked about elsewhere  video
00:02:38 by nikko mason created a method to
00:02:42 learn languages ​​by reading only by
00:02:45 reading reading interesting things things
00:02:50 at your level that would be fun to
00:02:54 read that you and beni co would like to read are
00:02:57 also a disciple of steven crash
00:03:00 in and still now
00:03:03 steven ibérico and also collaborate  lg was created in 1984
00:03:10 lg is the method that I
00:03:16 rely the most on and I am the one on which it is based the most
00:03:19 dreaming spanish a lg by marvin brown
00:03:23 and this is where
00:03:27 the dreaming spanish marvin
00:03:30 brown method also came from  based on steeven craig
00:03:33 also based on steven's theories
00:03:35 in class
00:03:36 first he created a method that he called
00:03:39 listening approach the listening approach
00:03:41 and then renamed changed the  name
00:03:45 to lg and the same as dreaming spanish is a
00:03:50 method based on listening listening
00:03:53 listening a lot not speaking not
00:03:56 translating not translating from one language to another
00:04:00 then in 1990 story listening
00:04:06 story listening by benny co mason
00:04:08 also come and ccoo a bit adapts  his
00:04:12 method of teaching to learn by
00:04:16 listening no then it is done
00:04:19 through stories also talking
00:04:22 the teacher talks and tells stories is
00:04:26 very similar to lg they are very similar
00:04:30 so beni co's method is also
00:04:34 very similar to ours to the dreaming
00:04:37 spanish so also in  the 90s
00:04:42 in the 90s t prs t prs appears for
00:04:48 blade rey de prs as you have seen
00:04:52 the name is very similar to tpr because they
00:04:57 talk king he started using tpr but he
00:05:02 realized that it was a bit limited he
00:05:06 could give orders to the children tell them
00:05:11 ok
00:05:12 take the marker  blue takes the
00:05:17 red marker but after using it for a while
00:05:23 he didn't know how to follow how to teach other
00:05:27 vocabulary other words that weren't
00:05:30 things around him  I didn't, so I
00:05:35 extended prs with stories and the tps
00:05:42 includes the teacher and the students
00:05:47 creating a story together tps also
00:05:51 has reading they also have to
00:05:55 read tpr yes there are actually several techniques there
00:05:59 are a few techniques and te prs is
00:06:03 important because it is used  it is used a
00:06:07 lot in many schools in the usa
00:06:12 so many schools many
00:06:14 institutes especially at the good level
00:06:17 of 12 years and up in the usa have
00:06:21 started using tpr s
00:06:24 and this has helped a lot so that more
00:06:28 people know what comprehensible input is
00:06:33 then tpr that  It is a bit difficult to
00:06:36 say exactly what is te prs and what
00:06:41 is not prs because each teacher does it
00:06:46 a bit in their own way and just like tpr s
00:06:50 there are other teachers in the usa who also
00:06:55 use comprehensible input in other
00:06:58 ways perhaps closer to story
00:07:01 listening or in a slightly
00:07:04 different way not following the following
00:07:07 exactly what is prs then in
00:07:12 2013 in 2013 was when I knew
00:07:18 what all this was when I knew  what was
00:07:21 the comprehensible input who is steven
00:07:25 crash what is lg in it was when i got to
00:07:29 know all of this not
00:07:33 finally in 2017 it
00:07:37 was when i started dreaming spanish i
00:07:41 started in 2017 in march not january february
00:07:46 march march 2017 what else later
00:07:51 also in 2017  later later in
00:07:56 2017 some youtube polyglots on
00:08:02 youtube a start talking about
00:08:05 comprehensible input like steve kaufman
00:08:10 and olé olé and richards make videos they
00:08:15 both made videos about
00:08:17 comprehensible input starting in 2017 with the two of them
00:08:21 with steve gorman
00:08:22 all and richards have
00:08:24 collaborated in dreaming spanish
00:08:27 you can see the videos with them
00:08:31 in 2018
00:08:34 there are also two very
00:08:38 important videos to help expand the
00:08:42 knowledge of comprehensible input 1 is
00:08:45 from poli
00:08:48 lot
00:08:50 a lot who made a video about him
00:08:53 learning Arabic and learning to  speak
00:08:56 arabic with comprehensible input and the other one
00:09:00 is what i've lert who also made a
00:09:06 video explaining comprehensible input
00:09:08 that many people have seen  so
00:09:12 recently also duolingo started
00:09:16 with their podcasts no duolingo has a
00:09:20 few podcast episodes where they
00:09:24 speak a little bit in english and a little bit in
00:09:27 spanish which is also good if it's
00:09:31 hit or miss it's a shame duolingo
00:09:34 hasn't really committed
00:09:37 or invested yet  on
00:09:40 comprehensible input it hasn't really created a
00:09:43 lot of comprehensible content it
00:09:46 seems like they haven't really
00:09:49 made a serious attempt yet to teach
00:09:52 with comprehensible input what I do see
00:09:55 is
00:09:55 more and more people recommend on
00:10:00 sites like reddit for example they
00:10:02 recommend learning  with
00:10:05 comprehensible input I have seen many
00:10:08 youtube channels that imitate dream in spanish
00:10:11 that teach the same as dreaming spanish
00:10:15 they teach russian they teach english they teach
00:10:22 german they teach several different
00:10:27 languages ​​imitating the dreaming
00:10:30 spanish style and this makes me very happy
00:10:34 because more and more  and more people will
00:10:38 know what comprehensible input is
00:10:40 and will have an easier time  il learn a
00:10:44 language learn a language well
00:10:46 learn it quickly and very easily
00:10:50 so i think that nowadays comprehensible input is
00:10:54 going well i hope we
00:10:57 continue with this inertia that we move
00:11:01 forward
00:11:02 today i am not going to ask you to write a
00:11:06 comment below i am not going to ask you  that you
00:11:10 go to your favorite social network that you
00:11:14 go to twitter to facebook to instagram
00:11:18 anywhere and write your
00:11:22 experience with comprehensible
00:11:25 input write how comprehensible input has helped
00:11:29 you share it with
00:11:32 your friends with your acquaintances
00:11:35 so that more and more people know what you  is
00:11:39 the input understandable okay come bye

00:00:06 you know who Alba Flores is, the actress who
00:00:10 plays Nairobi in this series, but did
00:00:14 you know that in Spain the last name Flores
00:00:18 is a very famous last name and not because of this
00:00:23 actress in this video I am going  I'm going to tell
00:00:35 you about Alba Flores's grandmother and why she is a super important icon of Spanish culture. Do you know who I'm talking about?
00:00:41 [Music]
00:00:44 I am the soul of Granada in Spain and in
00:00:48 this video I am going to tell you the story of
00:00:51 one of the  most famous characters of the
00:00:54 twentieth century in spain'
00:00:57 no las flores or las flores was born
00:01:00 in 1923 in the city of jerez de la
00:01:06 frontera in the south of spain in the
00:01:09 province of cadiz
00:01:11 she was born into a humble family it was
00:01:15 a family that was not very  Poor but they
00:01:18 didn't have much money either.
00:01:22 Lola's mother was a seamstress, a seamstress is
00:01:26 a woman who makes clothes,
00:01:29 sews clothes, and her father, Lola's father,
00:01:33 was a manager of a tavern, a bar, they
00:01:38 had a tavern in Dutch from  very
00:01:42 little when she was very little she
00:01:45 liked to sing and dance a lot she used to
00:01:50 climb on the bar where
00:01:54 her parents worked and sang and danced
00:01:57 and she liked the show a lot since
00:02:01 she was very little when she was
00:02:03 around 5 years old lola went to
00:02:08 Seville with her family her family
00:02:10 moved to Seville and lola went to school
00:02:14 there she went to
00:02:17 school a Catholic religious school
00:02:22 when a few years passed lola and her
00:02:26 family returned to xerez then
00:02:29 when they returned to xerez
00:02:31 lola was about 11 years old and she
00:02:36 started  to go to different academies
00:02:41 schools to learn to dance
00:02:44 she wanted to learn to dance like the
00:02:48 folkloric like the artists of the
00:02:51 time at that time in the 30s
00:02:55 of the 20th century in that decade of the
00:02:58 30s it was very very popular the
00:03:03 Spanish song is a  type of song a type
00:03:07 of music a
00:03:10 very
00:03:12 typical genre of Spain and also of the south of
00:03:17 Spain it
00:03:18 is that musical genre it is known as
00:03:22 copla it is called copla' that type of music
00:03:26 that type of  e song so lola was
00:03:30 learning
00:03:32 to be a good
00:03:35 couplet artist lola started performing in small
00:03:41 shows at small events when she
00:03:45 was very very young with 12 or 13 years old
00:03:49 she started performing at different
00:03:52 private parties and small events
00:03:58 but when she was 16 years old
00:04:02 lola got a bigger role
00:04:05 in a show in a slightly
00:04:09 bigger theater in her city and around that
00:04:13 time when she was 16 years old a
00:04:17 film director who was looking for an
00:04:20 actress for his new movie found
00:04:25 lola and he offered her a role  In his
00:04:31 film, the director offered Lola
00:04:34 a lot of
00:04:37 money, it was a considerable amount of money for the time,
00:04:41 so Lola went to Madrid and made the
00:04:45 film with this director, and in the end, she
00:04:49 decided to move to Madrid with her family.
00:04:53 Lola's family moved to  Madrid
00:04:55 also with her so that he could
00:04:59 get her more roles so that she could
00:05:02 continue
00:05:04 participating and working in different
00:05:06 shows then  In Madrid,
00:05:10 little by little she was getting more and
00:05:14 more important shows, she was becoming
00:05:17 more famous and more recognized and in one of
00:05:22 these shows she met a
00:05:26 singer who was already very famous, he was
00:05:29 even more famous than her and she fell
00:05:33 in love with him.
00:05:34 lola fell in love with this singer and
00:05:38 so for many years they
00:05:42 were working together on his
00:05:46 show and they also had a relationship
00:05:50 they were a couple
00:05:53 that relationship lasted for many hard years
00:05:56 well not many years but it lasted about
00:06:00 seven or eight years
00:06:02 and when the relationship ended
00:06:06 lola  and this man stopped working
00:06:10 together their show together ended
00:06:14 then when lola was
00:06:18 alone again when she separated from this man
00:06:21 and stopped making movies and shows
00:06:25 with this man a
00:06:29 very important spanish film producer looked for lola and
00:06:34 offered her  a very large contract
00:06:37 offered him a contract to make many
00:06:41 movies television shows
00:06:46 to even tour America by
00:06:49 countries  from latin america but also from the
00:06:54 usa so during those years lola
00:06:58 was traveling around america she was
00:07:03 touring
00:07:05 and she also became very popular very
00:07:08 famous in many latin american countries
00:07:10 people liked flowers a lot
00:07:14 because they had a very very special style she
00:07:19 had a had a lot  charisma was very
00:07:23 passionate and had a
00:07:28 very very special style of acting also at this time in
00:07:32 the 50s
00:07:34 lola met a
00:07:38 very famous guitarist and also fell in love with him and in
00:07:42 the end they both got married and had
00:07:45 three children they had two daughters and  a son
00:07:50 but unemployed it was not always easy to
00:07:54 maintain his success because in
00:07:59 the 60s people the public began to be
00:08:04 interested in other musical genres
00:08:09 in the 60s the pop that came from the
00:08:15 usa became very popular and the preferences
00:08:19 of the public  They changed a bit so
00:08:23 Lola had to reinvent herself, she had to
00:08:28 adapt to the new times in
00:08:32 order to continue maintaining her popularity,
00:08:35 but in the end she  she always managed it
00:08:38 she continued to participate in many
00:08:42 television programs and continued
00:08:45 making movies she continued her
00:08:49 work as a couplet artist when
00:08:52 lola had already established herself as a
00:08:55 very important couplet artist in a
00:09:00 very iconic figure of the Spanish couplet
00:09:04 or Spanish song  lola had a
00:09:09 problem with the treasury a legal problem they
00:09:14 accused lola of not paying taxes of
00:09:19 not paying the money she owed to
00:09:22 the spanish state for three years
00:09:28 so she had to go to court and in
00:09:32 the end she didn't have to go to jail
00:09:36 But he had to pay a fine of a lot of
00:09:40 money for this crime, but
00:09:43 this problem with the Spanish justice system
00:09:47 did not really affect the character of Lola
00:09:51 Flores much because she had already
00:09:54 established herself as a very important icon
00:09:58 in Spanish culture and in
00:10:03 Spanish music.  of the 20th century lo las
00:10:06 flores died of breast cancer in
00:10:10 1997 a cancer that had been
00:10:13 diagnosed in 1972 she had had
00:10:20 many operations  s and many treatments
00:10:23 but in the end
00:10:28 the cancer could not and she died at her home in Madrid
00:10:32 in 1997
00:10:35 and although it has been more than 20 years since the
00:10:39 flowers died, many Spaniards still
00:10:43 remember her with affection for being such a
00:10:47 charismatic character, so
00:10:51 passionate and so  human and this is the
00:10:55 story of lola flores

00:01:08 certificate of the birth certification document so
00:01:10 now it has become a little stricter
00:01:13 on the subject
00:01:15 but they never ask for this no no it is not one it
00:01:18 is a new requirement that
00:01:20 now they ask us for it
00:01:22 well but no  they did none of that to me they do
00:01:29 n't have it or they don't have the
00:01:30 birth
00:01:33 certificate okay wait wait a minute I'm going to
00:01:35 call I'm going to call my superior
00:01:37 yes yes sir sir lópez yes
00:01:41 I have a client a traveler who if not
00:01:45 you  You have the birth certificate I think you
00:01:46 haven't found out about the new
00:01:48 requirements
00:01:50 so well wait a minute
00:01:54 well I think you've been lucky you have
00:01:57 I can confirm it online I can access
00:02:00 the government website confirm your
00:02:03 birth
00:02:08 certificate ok
00:02:10 I see that in the passport  you have visas you
00:02:14 have a visa for canada
00:02:19 you have you have your departure flight
00:02:22 I don't really know when you will return
00:02:26 but that is a requirement you have to
00:02:28 have a departure flight to prove
00:02:30 that you are going to leave the country within
00:02:32 the visa period so I  I bought
00:02:35 my flight but it was open and I return
00:02:41 to the airlines, they let them do it
00:02:43 because you can buy another
00:02:45 return flight with another company or whatever,
00:02:49 yes, but in order for me to give you the
00:02:52 boarding pass, I need you to show me that you
00:02:55 have a ticket to  leave the country
00:02:58 within the time that the visa lasts,
00:03:00 well, but if I saw this document that
00:03:03 says that I have it as open, I know that I
00:03:06 bought it but it is open, it works  I'm sorry
00:03:09 but you're going to have to go now if you want
00:03:12 with your mobile phone and buy a flight
00:03:13 on the internet and then if you show it to me
00:03:16 then I can give you
00:03:19 the boarding pass I have to do it
00:03:22 now
00:03:24 if you need it to  For me to give you the
00:03:26 boarding pass, it is a requirement
00:03:27 of the Canadian government that they ask
00:03:30 us for it and if we cannot prove that
00:03:33 the travelers have a departure flight,
00:03:36 it is a problem and we can
00:03:39 have problems too
00:03:45 , so you are telling me that  I can't
00:03:46 travel I need to buy it now my
00:03:48 ticket even if I have it open like this
00:03:52 even if you have an open flight for
00:03:54 me now to give you the boarding pass
00:03:55 to be able to get on your flight you have to
00:03:58 show me a flight out of Canada
00:04:00 so I think it's one each  option is to
00:04:02 buy it now because online
00:04:07 ok only for a second from gm they didn't tell me that
00:04:11 the young man didn't notify him it's

00:11:46 luggage
00:11:51 in those areas
00:11:55 It's the only option
00:11:58 we could change him, give him another flight, he

00:12:03 fault, he didn't arrive on time and we
00:12:04 can't give him another flight,

00:02:53 whatever you want to call it it's almost the end I
00:02:55 also have  or what to buy ok but since
00:02:57 I'm going to change my house everything is fine
00:03:00 everything is fine later shared this is I
00:03:03 like to do a lot of this because well they
00:03:05 have recommended it for being healthy and
00:03:08 other issues but in general I love this salt I
00:03:11 love it I love it and  Well,
00:03:14 to continue with that,
00:03:17 as I told you, the water here in Mexico
00:03:18 is not as good to drink, you can drink it,
00:03:22 you don't die, but I don't
00:03:26 recommend it to drink, and it also tastes like
00:03:31 it doesn't taste good, it's not that from but the
00:03:34 blood, but you know  when you try something and
00:03:36 in your mind something like this is good anyway
00:03:39 this is something else that's why I'm talking about
00:03:41 water why
00:03:43 we put a few drops in water I don't know
00:03:47 if you also use it in your
00:03:49 countries
00:03:49 we put a few drops in water and
00:03:52 disinfect the  vegetables like
00:03:55 I don't know any vegetable or anything
00:03:58 you want to disinfect about 34
00:04:02 minutes apparently 10 minutes I just read
00:04:05 it I've done it most everything in my life I'm
00:04:08 full of microbes
00:04:09 no so
00:04:12 for about 10-15 minutes a  Apparently and your
00:04:15 little things are disinfected next,
00:04:22 almost when I get fat, that's another
00:04:25 matter. I don't know if I already talked to you or if I
00:04:28 haven't talked to you, I'll talk to you soon when
00:04:31 I went to study abroad in Canada, I
00:04:33 gained about 20 to 25 kilos
00:04:36 I've lost weight and I've learned to eat a little
00:04:38 healthier. I think I'm not
00:04:41 so bad now
00:04:45 and well now I do it for myself because I
00:04:48 feel very good with my body and everything and
00:04:50 this is
00:04:54 coconut oil coconut oil I don't like to use
00:04:58 canola oil  I don't even like the extra virgin much,
00:05:04 which
00:05:05 is coconut oil. I like it a lot. I use
00:05:08 almost everything, but this one has to be
00:05:10 put in small portions because it's
00:05:12 very caloric, but it doesn't matter,
00:05:15 you can't miss the coffee, the coffee is
00:05:18 also  It's running out I think that in
00:05:21 a week the coffee is over, it's too
00:05:24 big, that's the size of my face, it
00:05:26 's a big mountain, the coffee has to
00:05:29 always be there because I love to drink
00:05:31 coffee in the morning or after
00:05:33 training, I like it a lot and  especially
00:05:35 when combined with cinnamon I love it
00:05:40 I love it I love it well
00:05:43 another of them yes or yes I don't know if you
00:05:46 are a vegetarian vegan alien
00:05:50 someone animal I don't know I'm going to share
00:05:54 what I have in my kitchen I'm
00:05:56 trying to change my diet  but
00:06:00 if I have to have eggs yes or yes because they
00:06:05 are a great source of protein I know that
00:06:07 many legumes or cereals
00:06:11 are also good but for now the egg is one of
00:06:13 my favorite things so if I
00:06:16 eat it and I always have to have it in the
00:06:19 fridge myself  myths
00:06:22 another that is not going to take us out of the mood ok
00:06:29 of course I have to have tequila
00:06:31 gentlemen tequila because I am Mexican
00:06:34 all Mexicans have tequila in
00:06:36 our refrigerators in our
00:06:38 houses it is more if I open this door
00:06:42 it is not full of tequila but it should
00:06:45 should I'm not kidding  It is not that
00:06:47 all Mexicans have tequila in
00:06:49 our homes, but it is something that if I
00:06:51 ask, 99.8 percent are going
00:06:55 to have tequila in their homes and they do not usually  n
00:06:58 che I am not the exception that I have
00:07:01 tequila it is a good tequila
00:07:03 if you want don julio
00:07:05 you are not paying for that but it is a good
00:07:08 tequila next speaking of alcohol
00:07:12 I have to also have beer yes or yes
00:07:14 because sometimes I crave this
00:07:17 is a  beer that I've
00:07:18 tried lately maybe beer lovers
00:07:20 will say no what is that very light
00:07:24 as you like trying to eat well and
00:07:26 some things I have seen is that this
00:07:29 is good it has few calories and I
00:07:32 liked it but good in general it should  have
00:07:36 beer yes or yes because then from time to time I
00:07:38 crave it is not that I drink
00:07:40 my tequila every day my beer but I
00:07:43 crave
00:07:44 nothing else we are going to do it with a little bit
00:07:47 of
00:07:51 spice we call it tajín it is from Mexico and it
00:07:55 is a powder  It is going to show here it is this
00:07:59 is a little powder that falls like this and it gets on
00:08:03 the fruits and vegetables and we love it but
00:08:07 you can eat it
00:08:09 like this
00:08:11 I love it it's like acid it has lemon salt
00:08:15 and a little spicy it's a little spicy
00:08:18 but not much it's nothing  For me, it's nothing
00:08:20 but be careful if you don't eat chili, well, only
00:08:25 every time it's
00:08:26 another chili, this is what I have to have, it
00:08:31 's a Brazilian chili, well, I brought it
00:08:34 from Brazil, this is from Brazil, it's called
00:08:38 malagueta pepper.
00:08:41 The pronunciation in Portuguese would be
00:08:44 malagueta pepper, the
00:08:46 same
00:08:50 And speaking of sauces, I also have to
00:08:52 have this thing, you know
00:08:54 what a chimichurri is, what is on top of
00:08:57 the pizza or not on the pizza?
00:09:06 In Italy, I don't know if
00:09:08 I'm wrong, the one with olive oil
00:09:11 and some herbs, well, our
00:09:16 chimichurri, just listen well, only from
00:09:19 my city, this one tastes incredible on
00:09:24 pizza and this tastes incredible,
00:09:29 it doesn't matter if I know you, I'm going to
00:09:31 give you a bottle of this  It's more of a bottle and
00:09:34 a tequila, what do you think is
00:09:37 good? Let's remove that because I
00:09:40 don't know them today, I would like to meet them, but I
00:09:43 don't know them.
00:09:49 sas and all
00:09:52 that is a Parmesan, I know, many will
00:09:58 say that this is not Parmesan, that
00:10:01 I don't know that the one that is false, well, it
00:10:04 does not matter, gentlemen, I like to have
00:10:06 Parmesan because because I like to make a
00:10:08 lot of pasta, I love
00:10:12 gluten-free pasta.  I'm sorry I'm sorry but I love
00:10:15 gluten-free pasta and Parmesan cheese
00:10:18 which isn't Parmesan cheese I
00:10:20 like it too so let me eat well something
00:10:24 else that has to have onion
00:10:28 normally I would have white security
00:10:30 right this red onion pink
00:10:34 onion purple onion I don't feel like it's like that
00:10:37 I have used and I wanted to show you not
00:10:40 this onion
00:10:43 I have to have onion because
00:10:45 it gives it the garlic flavor I don't like garlic
00:10:47 that it is this little thing that tastes very
00:10:50 strong I like it but in sauces or
00:10:54 the flavor is not noticeable but the onion has
00:10:56 I don't like to eat onions
00:10:58 like that, I mean no no no I'm not kidding
00:11:03 but only roasted or in my eggs
00:11:08 in hamburgers in pasta they know to
00:11:13 give it flavor and speaking of flavor I don't
00:11:16 eat  sugar but I like to have
00:11:19 sugar substitutes that are less
00:11:21 caloric and according to this, according to this, they do not
00:11:25 cause as much damage but I only use them from
00:11:27 time to time, like when I make
00:11:30 cupcakes, cakes
00:11:32 , whatever,
00:11:35 yes or yes, because when we eat we
00:11:39 stain our faces, our little hands too  I
00:11:42 know that you do it
00:11:45 napkins napkins
00:11:48 yes or yes I have to have napkins ok
00:11:51 there is no way not to have
00:11:54 napkins and if I don't have well then
00:11:57 plan b we have all done it
00:12:00 toilet paper toilet paper as a napkin
00:12:05 next
00:12:09 I am not going to put them  the spray but this
00:12:13 is white vinegar because I have it here
00:12:15 because when I put it in my
00:12:18 salads that I mostly put it in
00:12:20 salads it sprays super incredible I don't
00:12:24 waste everything it's incredible and I brought it from
00:12:28 Brazil thanks to the person who
00:12:31 gave it to me who  I know you are not watching the
00:12:33 video but thank you
00:12:35 I love it I love it I love it and every
00:12:38 time it runs out I fill it in
00:12:41 well
00:12:42 next things they are going to say well
00:12:46 yes
00:12:50 I talk about e  sto frozen strawberries
00:12:54 I have to have the ones that have to have
00:12:57 yes or yes but frozen strawberries frozen
00:12:59 fruits frozen vegetables
00:13:02 are well the things that mostly
00:13:09 smell good and this is almost
00:13:13 cheaper than buying some strawberries well no
00:13:16 not saying organic but fresh  You know
00:13:19 without freezing this is cheaper
00:13:22 than buying it so if I
00:13:26 buy it frozen it's cheaper and since
00:13:28 I'm studying money you have to
00:13:32 save well speaking of frozen fruits
00:13:38 but yes gentlemen yes guys this used to
00:13:43 be or is still a banana a
00:13:48 banana the yellow fruit of the
00:13:52 minions whatever you want to call it
00:13:56 because it's black because it's been in the
00:13:59 freezer for about a month and it's
00:14:05 still good if I open it with this I make my
00:14:08 smoothies I don't die so I think I
00:14:12 have magical
00:14:14 or biological powers we're almost done

00:14:41 but this one is special because because it is
00:14:45 made here in the drawing you can see that it is
00:14:48 made with corn and nopal nopal nopal
00:14:51 is a commune a cactus made from the cactus
00:14:56 almost from the cactus so they are a
00:15:01 little bit healthier  than the normal ones
00:15:02 that are made of corn ok we
00:15:05 Mexicans do eat flour tortillas
00:15:07 but not very often we do not always
00:15:13 consume more of the corn ones well now
00:15:16 I have the nopal ones with corn but they are very
00:15:19 good I love them and they have half the
00:15:21 calories don't say
00:15:24 well almost to finish I have to have
00:15:27 these look how beautiful they are they are what
00:15:31 we call parakeets they open up

00:18:52 [Music]
",3
179,"00:00:00 Do you remember that Carlos Segundo died without
00:00:05 descendants, he died without having children and
00:00:09 like other times when a king dies without
00:00:13 children a war began and today I am going to
00:00:18 tell you what happened after the death of
00:00:22 Carlos Segundo
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:29 so today I am going to explain the
00:00:33 period between 1707 not between 1700 and 1808
00:00:45 then carlos second before he died he
00:00:49 made a will he wrote in his
00:00:53 will who he chose to be the
00:00:57 next king and carlos second had two
00:01:00 options had had felipe felipe duke
00:01:06 of anjou and had had carlos
00:01:11 carlos of austria felipe of  anjou felipe
00:01:16 de anjou was the grandson of
00:01:19 his half-sister's sister he was the grandson of the daughter
00:01:24 of his father's first wife and
00:01:27 carlos from austria he was the son of his
00:01:31 cousin from carlos second's cousin and
00:01:34 carlos second was not clear no
00:01:36 He knew which one to choose and he chose Felipe
00:01:41 Felipe who will become Felipe Quinto
00:01:44 Felipe Quinto
00:01:47 Felipe Quinto of Spain so the King
00:01:51 of France was the grandfather of Felipe
00:01:54 Quinto and the King of France.  I was very
00:01:57 happy because now France and Spain
00:02:00 would be allies, not France and Spain, which
00:02:05 had fought many times, now they
00:02:08 would be allies, they could work together,
00:02:11 but France and Spain together were a lot of
00:02:17 power, and the rest of Europe, well, the rest
00:02:21 of Europe didn't like it.  they wanted
00:02:23 spain and france to ally themselves then
00:02:27 several other european countries formed the
00:02:32 alliance alliance of the hague alliance
00:02:37 and the alliance of the already says no that the
00:02:41 king had to have been charles of
00:02:45 austria he had to be charles of austria of
00:02:47 course and  then a war
00:02:50 begins the war of the succession begins
00:02:54 then in this war this war was
00:02:57 basically spain and france against
00:03:02 all the others against the rest of
00:03:05 europe then spain begins to wage
00:03:09 battles against other countries and spain
00:03:12 begins to lose it begins to lose
00:03:15 many battles the  territories of the
00:03:19 old kingdom of aragon the territories
00:03:22 of
00:03:23 this area of ​​spain
00:03:27 are in favor of carlos de austria
00:03:31 meanwhile the i  english the english
00:03:35 and english capture gibraltar let's see the
00:03:38 english are going to be green
00:03:41 the english capture gibral gibraltar
00:03:44 capture menorca also then a
00:03:48 few years go by and france wins
00:03:52 some battles quite a few battles and
00:03:55 then a peace is reached it fry
00:03:59 signs the treaty treaty of utrecht
00:04:02 so in this treaty
00:04:07 felipe a new is confirmed as king of spain felipe the
00:04:11 fifth is confirmed to continue
00:04:13 being king
00:04:16 then france was happy
00:04:20 france was happy and carlos I'm going to
00:04:24 make it purple
00:04:26 carlos stays with the netherlands
00:04:32 netherlands with milan and  with naples naples
00:04:36 around here more or less and
00:04:39 england stays with gibraltar and
00:04:43 menorca they keep them but catalonia
00:04:46 catalonia was still against
00:04:51 felipe fifth set and in 1714 on
00:04:59 september 11, 1714 there is an army of
00:05:05 france and spain- that  they get
00:05:09 into barcelona they get barcelona to
00:05:11 surrender and this day is still
00:05:16 celebrated as the day of catalonia as the
00:05:19 diada  from Catalonia
00:05:22 and Mallorca Majorca is also
00:05:26 captured later so Felipe
00:05:29 Quinto was angry he was
00:05:33 angry that these areas had rebelled they
00:05:37 had gone against him and he created the
00:05:41 decrees new plant
00:05:45 decrees which are the new plant decrees he says
00:05:48 that Catalonia that  valencia and that aragon and
00:05:53 mallorca lose rights that have
00:05:56 fewer rights less power than they
00:06:00 had before and because before they had their
00:06:03 own courts their own their own
00:06:06 government and in 1716
00:06:11 in 1716 finally everything is
00:06:17 unified the entire government is unified
00:06:19 felipe is blue  unifies the entire
00:06:23 government of Spain' into a single government
00:06:26 at this time also between Spain and
00:06:33 France a pact is made a pact is made to
00:06:37 always fight to fight together in
00:06:40 wars then there was a war against
00:06:43 austria they fought I have no colors
00:06:47 I need more colors  they fought against
00:06:52 austria against austria to decide the
00:06:57 next king of poland and at the end of
00:07:02 this war spain got  or naples he
00:07:05 got naples then
00:07:10 the wife of felipe quinto appears here the queen was
00:07:15 isabel isabel from farnesio iv a isabel
00:07:20 wanted to recover parts of italy for spain
00:07:25 and got naples got
00:07:28 naples and parma pharma i'm not sure
00:07:32 where parma is but she put her two sons
00:07:35 to govern  naples and
00:07:37 in italy then felipe quinto dies
00:07:43 felipe quinto dies and becomes king his
00:07:46 son fernando the sixth
00:07:49 fernando is not felipe fernando the sixth
00:07:53 fernando the sixth was a modern person he
00:07:57 wanted to modernize the country he wanted to
00:08:01 modernize it based on the principles
00:08:04 of the illustration of the illustration that
00:08:08 It was above all a French phenomenon to
00:08:11 adapt and adapt the illustration to a
00:08:16 monarchy to the monarchy system of
00:08:19 kings of Spain then at this time
00:08:23 between France England between France and
00:08:27 the United Kingdom- there was a war a war
00:08:31 that lasted seven years and Fernando the sixth
00:08:35 decided not to  get involved not enter the war
00:08:38 but at this moment fernando sixth
00:08:43 dies
00:08:45 first he dies  his wife laughed and then he
00:08:48 died he had no children
00:08:51 and the king became carlos the third
00:08:54 carlos the third carlos the third who was
00:08:59 in naples he comes back from naples
00:09:03 to be the king of spain and carlos
00:09:07 does want to enter the war he wants to
00:09:10 enter the  war between france and
00:09:13 england and this war ends with the
00:09:17 treaty of paris in paris the treaty of
00:09:20 paris of 1763 in this treaty france
00:09:30 france had canada and france gave
00:09:34 canada to the british here spain
00:09:39 spain had florida and spain gave
00:09:43 florida to the british and  france to
00:09:47 thank us to thank us
00:09:50 fighting together in the war gave us
00:09:54 louisiana louisiana around here more or less
00:09:58 louisiana created then in 1775 there the
00:10:06 war of independence of the usa that the
00:10:10 usa becomes an independent country in
00:10:14 this war the
00:10:17 usa fights against the colonies no  the
00:10:22 colonies against england and the usa win
00:10:26 then the result is that spain
00:10:30 recovers menorca menorca this small island also
00:10:33 happens to be good now
00:10:37 everything is not t  Everything becomes Spanish, Majorca
00:10:41 already was before,
00:10:42 Menorca becomes Spanish and
00:10:45 Florida Florida Florida also
00:10:51 becomes part of Spain again
00:10:53 so the time of Carlos the Third was
00:10:58 a good time for the economy, it was a
00:11:02 time when the government became  more
00:11:05 modern trade was given more freedom
00:11:10 to trade with the americas more freedom was given
00:11:14 to also earn more money
00:11:16 with taxes the population grew many
00:11:21 areas of spain where there was little population
00:11:24 because it grew the population began to
00:11:27 see more people
00:11:29 we went from 7 to  11 million from 7 million
00:11:34 to 11 to 11 million people and it's
00:11:39 good this is the time of the industry
00:11:42 of the industrial revolution of the
00:11:45 steam engine and coal and a
00:11:48 lot of industry was created in Barcelona and
00:11:51 Valencia
00:11:53 so this is fully the  Age of
00:11:57 Enlightenment and Enlightenment
00:12:00 One One of the values ​​of Enlightenment
00:12:04 is to put an end to absolutism that there
00:12:08 would be no absolutism that there would not be a
00:12:11 king who had all the power  no, but in
00:12:15 spain enlightenment is
00:12:19 transformed into enlightened
00:12:23 despotism enlightened despotism means that the
00:12:26 king the king takes the values ​​of the
00:12:31 enlightenment that interests him tells the
00:12:33 people it's okay to do this yes but but
00:12:37 with a king I'm still here  here but the
00:12:41 other things well I give you freedom no
00:12:44 then after carlos the third came
00:12:48 carlos the fourth again no they were not very
00:12:52 original
00:12:53 carlos the fourth and then at this moment
00:12:57 the french revolution begins
00:13:02 the guillotines kill the king of
00:13:06 france louis 16 no louis 16 is
00:13:11 guillotined then, well, of course, Spain
00:13:15 defended the King of France because Spain,
00:13:19 well, was interested in continuing with a
00:13:22 monarchy, the king wanted to continue
00:13:24 ruling Spain, so after Louis
00:13:28 16 has been guillotined, Spain goes to war
00:13:33 against France, declares a war
00:13:36 against Republican France, and, well,  they fight
00:13:39 for a while spain wins some
00:13:43 battles loses some battles and in the
00:13:46 end a peace is signed pa  z And it must
00:13:50 be said that at this time many of
00:13:53 these decisions were not made by Carlos
00:13:57 Cuarto but rather by Godoy
00:14:00 Godoy was his trusted person
00:14:04 so here Godoy allied himself with Napoleon
00:14:09 Spain and France became allies to
00:14:12 fight against England  at this moment
00:14:17 there is a battle
00:14:19 and france uses the ships it uses the fleet of
00:14:23 spain against england but england
00:14:26 wins and destroys the fleet the navy of
00:14:30 spain and this creates problems for the
00:14:34 business of spain trade with the
00:14:37 americas and here france declares war on
00:14:42 portugal  France is going to fight against
00:14:45 Portugal and asks for permission to cross to
00:14:49 cross Spain to go to Portugal but France
00:14:53 did not have enough with Portugal and
00:14:57 since they were already in Spain they decided, well,
00:15:00 we are going to take Spain, we are also going to
00:15:03 stay with Spain and in 1808, in 1808,
00:15:10 a war began.  war between spain and
00:15:14 france between napoleon
00:15:17 and spain what happened will spain
00:15:21 win defend itself against napoleon let's
00:15:26 see what will happen

122,"00:00:00 Hello, welcome to Fukuoka and today I
00:00:11 want to show you a bit about the city because
00:00:14 I was here. I was in Fukuoka in 2014.
00:00:19 I was only a week but I was
00:00:22 visiting a friend, a friend of mine from Kyoto.
00:00:25 We were friends when I lived in
00:00:27 Kyoto and
00:00:30 he came to  live here
00:00:32 and it was the time when I was
00:00:34 taking a trip all over Japan and
00:00:37 I got here I got to Fukuoka and I decided to
00:00:39 stay here for a few days because that way I
00:00:42 could get to know the city a bit and be
00:00:45 with my friend not
00:00:48 with my friend we used to come a lot to  this
00:00:51 square that is called that with the good
00:00:55 park so that it is called a park is
00:00:57 really it is more like a square
00:01:00 and not like a small park so it is
00:01:02 a bit like a park
00:01:05 and that is called a park that I think
00:01:09 well we used to come here a lot we would sit
00:01:11 You see here and there's plenty of space to sit
00:01:14 down and we sat down and had a drink
00:01:18 or something and here
00:01:20 we'd chat and I was there, my
00:01:23 friend sometimes another friend would come
00:01:28 or depending on the day more
00:01:31 people would come and they were there.  We are here chatting and
00:01:32 hanging out and I am going to show you a
00:01:36 little good here in the park there is not
00:01:38 much to see
00:01:40 there is something a little interesting that is
00:01:42 behind there
00:01:44 I guess you see after a bicycle
00:01:46 and it is because there is an
00:01:49 underground bicycle parking  going down there you can
00:01:52 go down
00:01:53 and everything that is
00:01:55 below the square there is a
00:01:59 bike parking lot you can drop your bike there
00:02:01 and pay by the hour pay for each hour
00:02:04 you have it there and there is plenty of space there is
00:02:07 plenty of space to put the
00:02:09 bikes
00:02:10 but apart from that there isn't anything
00:02:13 much more interesting but today I'm going to
00:02:16 walk around this area a bit and I'm going to
00:02:19 explain a little more about what there is and the
00:02:21 interesting things that are good, the things
00:02:24 that I remember from when I was here in
00:02:27 2014
00:02:30 and one thing is here the building this is to
00:02:33 put solar and plaza
00:02:36 and it's good it's a shopping center I
00:02:39 'm going to go in I'm going to go in I hope they don't
00:02:41 tell me anything I hope there's no
00:02:43 problem I'm just going to show you
00:02:46 the z  one from the lobby and it's not because
00:02:48 it's a very, very interesting building or
00:02:51 anything, it's because I'm going to explain a little bit about
00:02:54 what we did when I
00:02:57 was here
00:03:00 with my friend we played a game and I
00:03:03 'm going to explain a little about the game the game
00:03:06 we used to play so you can see that here
00:03:09 there are well there are trees there are no planters
00:03:14 with trees I think that when I was
00:03:17 here when I came here with my friend there were
00:03:20 also benches there were a few benches
00:03:23 but well the important thing is not that the
00:03:25 important thing is what we did with my
00:03:27 friend
00:03:28 me with my friend and with another friend 33
00:03:32 people we played a game it
00:03:35 's a game of making rock paper scissors
00:03:39 we played the three of us made rock paper
00:03:42 not rock paper scissors until one
00:03:46 person lost until there was a
00:03:48 loser then what about the
00:03:50 loser the  loser
00:03:53 had a good thing like a punishment or a challenge
00:03:57 something that he had to do
00:04:00 and that punishment or that challenge to we decided
00:04:04 it we decided it before before doing rock
00:04:07 paper scissors we decided that  is what
00:04:10 the loser would have to do no
00:04:12 then what kind of things
00:04:15 did the loser have to do well for example the
00:04:20 loser had to go to a person he
00:04:22 had to go to a man and ask him
00:04:25 to marry him or please marry
00:04:28 me
00:04:30 or he had  to go to some people and
00:04:33 ask them excuse me excuse me
00:04:38 now what year is it and when the person
00:04:41 answered well it's 2014
00:04:48 no well something like that wasn't good things
00:04:52 a bit embarrassing that
00:04:55 normally you wouldn't want to go and say
00:04:57 throw yourself at a person  that you don't know is a
00:05:00 person who is not a friend of yours it's a
00:05:03 bit embarrassing a bit of a thing but
00:05:08 that was the funny thing that the
00:05:10 loser had to put himself in an
00:05:12 embarrassing situation in a situation
00:05:14 that was good it was difficult it makes you
00:05:18 nervous  that at the beginning it is difficult to
00:05:20 do it and yes, it is true that
00:05:23 many times before doing it because the
00:05:26 person thought a lot about the loser
00:05:27 , he thought a lot about it, he searched for a long time
00:05:31 because he searched to see what the per  It sounds
00:05:33 ideal to see a person who doesn't have the
00:05:36 face of being very, very serious, no, but
00:05:42 well, it's a very fun game and it's a
00:05:45 game that let's see now, I don't know, I don't know if I
00:05:48 would
00:05:49 do it, yes, it's true that to see you bother a
00:05:53 little  Some people have
00:05:56 fun and some find
00:05:58 it funny, but some don't understand it and it
00:06:01 's like what you do
00:06:03 and well I think it's not one, it doesn't
00:06:07 make their life worse in any way
00:06:10 but well some people don't
00:06:12 take it well
00:06:13 but it is true that the person
00:06:16 who has to say something to
00:06:18 someone who doesn't know him
00:06:20 opens up a lot
00:06:23 [Music]
00:06:24 your comfort zone doesn't expand a lot, it
00:06:27 helps you expand your comfort zone
00:06:30 because something that maybe before  You were
00:06:33 scared maybe you try it and you see that well
00:06:37 , nothing happens either, it's nothing special, it
00:06:40 doesn't hit you, it doesn't happen to you, or
00:06:46 they take you to the police and nothing bad happens to you,
00:06:48 no, so it can help to open up
00:06:51 our world a lot, what  we think
00:06:54 it is possible and expand  dir our
00:06:58 comfort zone so it was a
00:07:01 game we played in the lobby of the
00:07:04 building that a bit just for a while
00:07:06 we were there for a while
00:07:08 and we continued doing that in good on the
00:07:11 street also people we met
00:07:13 on the street
00:07:15 well it was quite quite fun we
00:07:19 I am also going to show a park
00:07:23 another like another square that we were with
00:07:26 also with the same friends that there was
00:07:29 a festival when we went there and there was
00:07:31 just a festival and also well
00:07:35 we were playing the same game I
00:07:38 remember that my friend lost he lost a
00:07:41 round and his punishment  It was going to
00:07:45 go to someone and tell him to go to a guy and
00:07:50 tell him sorry, I broke up with my
00:07:54 girlfriend, I left him with my girlfriend, but my
00:07:56 girlfriend won't let me, she doesn't want to, she doesn't accept, she doesn't
00:08:01 accept that we've broken up that we're not together anymore,
00:08:02 so I  I have told my
00:08:05 girlfriend that I am gay I have said that
00:08:08 I don't like girls that is why we have to
00:08:09 break up and I have told her that I have a boyfriend
00:08:12 and so now my ex asks me for a
00:08:16 photo he wants me to  I'm sending you a picture with my
00:08:18 boyfriend so please we can take
00:08:20 some elf and I would like you to
00:08:24 take a selfie with you giving us a
00:08:26 kiss giving us a kiss the two
00:08:28 boys
00:08:30 and well it was also very
00:08:33 funny the person said well  no no no he did
00:08:34 n't want to obviously but well it's something it
00:08:38 was something very very funny and we did it
00:08:42 in this park that now we're going
00:08:45 to go now I'm going to show you
00:08:48 and also here is a very
00:08:50 cool decision that I'm also going to enter
00:08:52 I'm going to enter  In this difficult area, well, not
00:08:54 inside the building, but I'm going to go up
00:08:57 because there is something very interesting,
00:08:59 something that is not in many places that I
00:09:02 have not seen in many cities,
00:09:05 and let's see now, now we'll see, look at the
00:09:09 thesis of this building
00:09:13 with the entire garden  at all levels
00:09:15 everything like small terraces and up to the
00:09:19 top it
00:09:20 's quite quite impressive
00:09:25 I like I like this this building
00:09:27 all the side of the building is like
00:09:29 this all this side here is like this I'm going to go up vo  and
00:09:33 to go up a bit I think I'm not going to go
00:09:36 up to the top well I don't know we'll see I'm going
00:09:38 to start going up and see
00:09:39 where it leads
00:09:41 and well I'll also show you a bit about the
00:09:45 square the square is here which is also
00:09:48 not something super interesting  It's a
00:09:50 square with a dirt floor, let's
00:09:54 see, it's the place where I said that
00:09:56 there was a festival and that we were
00:09:58 playing the game with my friends
00:10:03 [Music] It
00:10:08 's full of students I don't know what
00:10:11 so many students are doing
00:10:14 but well this is the square there  the
00:10:17 path like this around
00:10:20 and in the center well it's so good today there's
00:10:24 something there's some kind of event or something it's
00:10:27 monday so the kids are going to school
00:10:31 and maybe today well they're organizing something
00:10:34 here and we're going to try going up
00:10:38 to the east garden for  at least 1 or 2
00:10:42 floors so you can see a little how it is no
00:10:46 I think it's open I think it's
00:10:47 open during the day it's open
00:10:49 all day at least until afternoon
00:10:54 and look there are two sides there are two sides
00:10:59 where there are stairs  and I know  You can go up
00:11:01 and well, we're going to try, we're going to go up
00:11:03 all the stairs a bit, so I don't know if there's an
00:11:08 elevator, if you can go up to the top in
00:11:10 an elevator,
00:11:13 but I'm strong, so I'm going to go
00:11:17 up the stairs, well, I don't want to
00:11:20 get sweaty here either.  to sweat a
00:11:23 lot
00:11:24 because yes, it's already October, it's already the
00:11:26 second half of October
00:11:28 and it's like October 22 or 23,
00:11:32 but well today it's fine today it's
00:11:35 quite hot there have been a few days that it
00:11:37 was colder but now since yesterday or
00:11:40 like this it's a little hotter and you
00:11:43 can go you can go well in short sleeves
00:11:47 so I don't want I don't want to sweat
00:11:52 you see well there are many different plants
00:11:56 there is no cedar Japanese cedar that has
00:12:00 these small leaves
00:12:03 and there are good different types of  trees
00:12:06 quite a few trees
00:12:10 the good fact different types
00:12:13 of herb plants and such I also
00:12:17 don't know it seems very interesting is that
00:12:20 in a city like this well it's a
00:12:23 medium-sized city it's not a very big city but
00:12:26 there is a space like this for  To disconnect
00:12:28 here you can come here and disconnect a
00:12:31 bit from the chaos of stress of life in
00:12:35 the city
00:12:37 and well I find it very very interesting
00:12:41 here even if I go up to the top I don't know if
00:12:45 there is something I don't know if it can be seen if you
00:12:49 can see the views
00:12:51 I suppose so a little this summer
00:12:52 because from here, well, I can see
00:12:55 something.
00:12:59 I was saying why there are a
00:13:03 lot of trees and I didn't know if the
00:13:06 trees block the view and don't let you see,
00:13:10 but hey, I'm going to go up, come on, I'm going to go up
00:13:13 and I'll show you.  From above, what is the
00:13:17 view that you can see? Okay, and well, we're
00:13:20 here at the top, finally, the 13th, 13th, or 14th floor,
00:13:25 well, it would be the 14th from here and I've gotten
00:13:29 a little tired,
00:13:31 and if it's placed from a good view of
00:13:35 football  not
00:13:39 here here there is an area that
00:13:43 would be a viewpoint a viewpoint an area
00:13:46 to look around but it is only open on
00:13:49 saturdays sundays and holidays
00:13:53 so today it is closed because it is monday
00:13:55 but hey from here we can already see a
00:13:58 pretty nice
00:14:02 view and if there isn't  too many things to
00:14:05 do  in fukuoka it is not a very
00:14:09 touristy place but
00:14:12 a place that is
00:14:14 good to use is on the island of
00:14:17 the four main islands of japan it is
00:14:21 the southernmost island
00:14:23 and there are many interesting things in

00:01:39 minutes to defuse the bomb
00:01:43 and this bomb is not very complicated, it is not
00:01:45 very big, there are still 33 modules, 3
00:01:48 parts in the bomb and we can make
00:01:51 mistakes three times, if not continue and make
00:01:54 mistakes more than three times, we die
00:01:57 easily if we are going to win  Make no mistake,
00:02:01 never link, come on, let's
00:02:04 try,
00:02:06 we start charging
00:02:12 very well, we have five minutes to see
00:02:16 that the lights come on, okay, then
00:02:19 we have a module with cables, okay, with
00:02:24 four cables, there is room for six, but
00:02:26 there are five cables, and only five, if the
00:02:29 last one is black.  no the last one is not black

00:02:59 another module there are four keys
00:03:03 what  jones keys ok we've
00:03:05 done this before you already know a little bit of what it's
00:03:07 about haha ​​there's a white star ok it
00:03:10 's stuffed ok it's what  And more there is one or
00:03:14 that instead of having the tail
00:03:16 up, it crosses and has it downwards,
00:03:19 another one that is like an ass that on
00:03:24 top has like an eye with a
00:03:26 Welsh comma from the eye, yes, and the other that is like

00:03:37 press ass ass or side the r the war
00:03:43 and the star of the stars very well
00:03:46 and in the end the last module is
00:03:52 like a radar or something if it is like a
00:03:54 grid of blue dots there is a
00:03:57 red triangle that goes around there are
00:03:59 two green circles around two of
00:04:01 the points and there is a white dot there are
00:04:03 directions there are keys to press

00:04:30 first point is in row 1 column 2
00:04:33 f  row 1 column 2 row 1 column
00:04:42 and the 1 with a 2 c

00:07:21 behind, okay, there are two buttons, two
00:07:23 button modules,
00:07:24 we're going to go every now and then, we're not going to look at it.
00:07:37 the name says holtz no according to holtz there
00:07:40 are no batteries ok
00:07:46 there are no batteries
00:07:52 blue and it says hold look
00:07:57 when you press the button and don't let go
00:08:00 ok what color is blue day
00:08:05 then let go when you see a 4
00:08:08 anywhere  Wherever it is, it's ok, there are 4
00:08:10 minutes left and there's another button the same but it
00:08:12 turns yellow and it says board,
00:08:18 it's not blue, it
00:08:22 doesn't say tonight's,
00:08:26 there
00:08:30 are no more than two batteries,

00:08:41 color  red
00:08:46 when you see an escaped 11 we have but a
00:08:50 few seconds
00:08:53 5 4 3 2 1
00:08:58 ok ok its greens very well the four
00:09:01 buttons again the four buttons ok they
00:09:04 can also sing them and from there
00:09:07 the French AEE sings to me sings to me the street makes me very
00:09:14 good  from French
00:09:17 like this when it is but I'm still in Latin
00:09:19 in about five months it's going to cyclopaedia the cycle
00:09:23 for the aee now okay there's already a tiny debt
00:09:29 one of it's tiny like a bird with a
00:09:32 crooked tail for 3ds but it
00:09:35 's upside down
00:09:36 at 66 okay okay  Of course, if it is said, it is
00:09:41 more like a 6, then if there is a
00:09:43 capital letter to the left with a 16 on
00:09:46 top, yes, and there is a stock, the Greek is painted,
00:09:49 but well, it is like a center
00:09:51 with a cup with a stick in the middle, it is
00:09:55 called yes, yes.  yes uppercase  the
00:09:58 if it persists in what order
00:10:00 the reversed chunga is
00:10:05 worth
00:10:08 the neutral extras and the app if it is worth the
00:10:13 next one the same an h with a
00:10:17 little one on top
00:10:19 and good like the y of the Russian which is like
00:10:23 an n towards
00:10:24 him backwards let's say horizontally
00:10:28 the better horizontal  dry with a little thing
00:10:30 up it is tall
00:10:33 then there is one that is like a scar
00:10:35 with a line and two crossed lines if you don't
00:10:38 go and give it a capital omega
00:10:41 yes and again there is it
00:10:43 okay the scar is worth
00:10:49 the nh thing and the omega is okay
00:10:55 we have two  of cables, one has five
00:10:59 cables and the last one is black,
00:11:03 there is a red cable, there
00:11:08 are no black cables, yes,
00:11:11 cut the first one, it's
00:11:14 okay, done the last one, to another, of cables, there are
00:11:17 six cables, six cables, if there are any
00:11:21 yellow ones, it's
00:11:23 not worth looking for the serial number of the
00:11:27 pump  the serial number
00:11:30 5 to 9
00:11:32 9 short of the third cable
00:11:36 although we had 43 seconds left
00:11:41 cheers well we have done six we have gone up
00:11:44 from three elements to six and we have
00:11:48 survived back very good
00:11:53 very good very good we are going to do we are going to
00:11:57 do  er a we are going to do a couple more lime
00:12:00 than what we are we are on a roll

00:12:03 section 3 already unlocked
00:12:05 but hey we can continue little by little not
00:12:10 the widths for 40 seconds the same if we
00:12:13 go little by little this has four
00:12:17 modules
00:12:18 but since the number of modules hasn't gone down
00:12:21 surely they are going to be
00:12:24 more difficult modules
00:12:26 come here we are to see that the light turns on it's
00:12:31 worth four buttons again
00:12:34 the X with a stick crossed
00:12:37 vertically the X with a stick
00:12:39 crossed vertically if the delta
00:12:42 the  from tabal and initial question mark from
00:12:45 Spanish yes and one that is probably a letter
00:12:48 from Arabic but it seems more
00:12:50 common we have and removing the language delta
00:12:55 x question mark language very well done
00:12:59 next to cables come six cables
00:13:02 six yellow cables no excuse

113,"00:00:00 hello good, how is my name sandra and
00:00:04 today i want to talk to you about santander my
00:00:07 city well if i come from santander which is
00:00:18 a city in the north of spain
00:00:23 santander is the capital of cantabria and
00:00:26 of the cantabria region
00:00:29 although well there is also a place in
00:00:33 colombia that  It's called Santander, yes, but
00:00:35 well, I'm going to tell you about the place
00:00:38 where I was born.
00:00:42 Santander,
00:00:44 a more or less small city,
00:00:50 is the capital of Cantabria, which is an
00:00:53 autonomous community in Spain, one of the
00:00:57 regions of Spain,
00:01:01 and
00:01:03 then maybe the  name of santander
00:01:07 maybe you have heard it before
00:01:10 because santander is the name of a
00:01:14 very famous bank the santander bank that
00:01:18 is called like that because it was born in santander
00:01:22 in my city
00:01:25 well what famous things does santander have
00:01:29 let's see
00:01:32 santander is a very famous city for
00:01:35 its  sea ​​and by the sea we have very
00:01:43 beautiful beaches I honestly don't like going to the
00:01:46 beach
00:01:48 I don't like being under the sun
00:01:53 doing nothing
00:01:55 but I do recognize that I do know that it is
00:02:01 a place  very beautiful and that in Santander
00:02:05 we are very lucky to have these
00:02:07 beaches, yes the water is always very
00:02:12 cold because in case you did not know
00:02:16 in Santander the weather is
00:02:21 not usually very good it
00:02:23 always rains it
00:02:26 rains too much in winter in summer
00:02:29 always but well
00:02:33 the truth is  As I was saying, we have a
00:02:38 very beautiful sea, very beautiful beaches,
00:02:41 we have a very famous port
00:02:45 where you will see the boats, you will see the
00:02:49 boats and you will see people
00:02:53 practicing sailing and people who go by
00:02:58 boat on the sea because there is a
00:03:00 very famous sailing school
00:03:03 what else do we have in santander
00:03:09 the place i like
00:03:12 the most the lighthouse the lighthouse a lighthouse is a very
00:03:18 tall tower that emits light
00:03:22 to help ships navigate
00:03:26 the sea
00:03:28 and the truth is that it is a landscape
00:03:32 beautiful
00:03:34 whenever my friends come to see me they
00:03:38 come to visit me I take them to the lighthouse
00:03:42 so they can see
00:03:44 what else
00:03:45 [Music]
00:03:48 well I'm going to tell you about something that I really
00:03:51 like
00:03:52 about Santander well about Cantabria in
00:03:55 general
00:03:56 Cantabria that as I have  Said, it is the
00:03:59 community where Santander is located,
00:04:02 something that I really like are its sweets,
00:04:06 its desserts,
00:04:09 I love rheumatism ice cream, it
00:04:13 is an ice cream parlor, an ice cream shop
00:04:17 that you will see all over Cantabria
00:04:22 and I like them because they are very large ice creams, they
00:04:25 have a giant scoop, very very
00:04:29 big and they are very tasty
00:04:33 and what else I really like is the quesada
00:04:38 the quesada
00:04:41 does sound like cheese quesada
00:04:44 because it's made of cheese and it's like a
00:04:48 kind of cake I don't know how to describe it
00:04:51 the truth is unique and it's delicious I
00:04:58 love it
00:05:00 and then we have  Also the sobaos, which
00:05:04 is like a very soft cake,
00:05:08 very sweet too, and I
00:05:13 miss Saturdays a lot,
00:05:16 how
00:05:19 good that, as I say, is the food. I
00:05:24 think what I miss the most about my
00:05:29 region, apart from my family, my
00:05:32 friends of course  but hey, what I don't
00:05:36 miss, as I say, is the weather, the
00:05:40 rain, yes, because it's always raining
00:05:43 and it tires a little, but hey,
00:05:48 other things that can call our
00:05:52 attention that are surprising
00:05:55 Santander
00:05:58 would be, for example,
00:06:01 the
00:06:04 streets you will not see very old streets
00:06:08 because many years ago, approximately 80 years
00:06:13 ago, in the year 1941
00:06:18 there was a great fire, that is, a
00:06:22 huge fire that burned the entire city and the
00:06:29 old town, that is, the old part of
00:06:33 the city
00:06:36 disappeared so nowadays in santander we
00:06:40 don't have many old buildings like
00:06:44 in other parts of spain
00:06:46 but hey we have other things right
00:06:49 we have very beautiful beaches that more well
00:06:55 this refers to santander but for example
00:06:59 in cantabria we have many things
00:07:03 to see
00:07:04 Cantabria is a very mountainous region, it
00:07:07 has many mountains,
00:07:11 the truth is that we have a great variety
00:07:14 of landscapes and very different landscapes,
00:07:19 we have mountains, we have the sea.
00:07:33 coast,
00:07:37 that is to say, with a beach with sea
00:07:41 that more castro urdiales near the
00:07:45 community of the Basque country
00:07:48 also that more
00:07:53 pots than  It is in the south
00:07:57 of the region
00:07:59 and then there is a town that I really
00:08:02 like called Santillana del Mar
00:08:06 and the name is very funny because they
00:08:10 call it the city of the three lies
00:08:12 because it is neither holy nor flat nor does it have a
00:08:18 sea, so it is  the city or the town of
00:08:22 the three lies
00:08:25 and well, what else in cantabria
00:08:30 we have a very funny president well
00:08:35 I have brought cantabria and well since
00:08:38 we are in cantabria well I have allowed myself to
00:08:40 bring the flagship of
00:08:42 our gastronomy that then of the
00:08:44 cause  You are the ambassador and very
00:08:47 famous throughout Spain, Miguel Ángel Revilla, if he
00:08:51 is, he has a very special personality
00:08:56 and
00:08:57 all of Spain
00:09:00 knows him
00:09:03 and, well, if you come to Cantabria, then do not
00:09:09 hesitate to write or contact me and I
00:09:13 will tell you what to see, of course, although you have
00:09:18 to keep in mind.  It also counts some
00:09:20 things when speaking Spanish in
00:09:22 Cantabria
00:09:24 in Cantabria when we want to talk about
00:09:30 something small or
00:09:35 something we are fond of
00:09:38 or we use a co uk instead of milestone and it
00:09:44 is possible  For example, in all of Spain we say
00:09:49 pequeñito pequeñita but only in
00:09:53 Cantabria or also in nearby areas,
00:09:57 we can also say pequeño pequeño
00:10:02 here, that is, a co uk, so
00:10:06 you will hear that everywhere,
00:10:09 but if you want to know more about
00:10:12 Cantabria or more about  Santander, well,
00:10:17 I am available for any type of
00:10:19 question, so I hope you
00:10:22 have learned a little more about
00:10:26 this part of Spain that is not
00:10:29 so well known in other countries.
00:10:46 i

147,"00:00:00 Sandra is here today thanks for an
00:00:04 exam what are we going to talk about today window well
00:00:06 we are going to talk about friendship
00:00:09 and friends to see what we think of this
00:00:11 perfect topic
00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:19 hello hello how are you very well but I think
00:00:24 you are better  there in spain they are still almost there you
00:00:29 are finally at home very well yes and
00:00:32 now that you have returned there are you going to
00:00:35 meet your friends from there yes of course
00:00:38 yes because the truth is that I can see them
00:00:41 very few times a year not as I come it
00:00:43 is a  I haven't seen them
00:00:46 much in Spain, but well,
00:00:49 so this is my chance. How
00:00:51 long has it been since I've seen them?
00:00:54 Well, the truth is that this time, not
00:00:57 for so long since summer, which for me,
00:01:00 well, it's not so much because I had
00:01:02 to come back.  to Spain for other issues
00:01:04 now and I did not expect to return this summer
00:01:08 so they are surprised that they will not
00:01:11 be able to see now but well
00:01:13 the same thing happens to me too, not as my
00:01:16 friends from Spain because I see them very
00:01:19 often once a  year is clear and they
00:01:22 are already here  ostumbradas true I know that some will see me when I go
00:01:25 down because
00:01:34 perhaps I am in a place like a bank that
00:01:36 is a very distant place and to the people that
00:01:38 is not true when I was in the
00:01:44 bank your friends went to
00:01:46 visit you if we coincide precisely
00:01:49 because of  Let's see if we're lucky to be in the
00:01:53 bank, but you have to have
00:01:59 someone who can show you the city a bit
00:02:01 and tell you about the interesting places, and it
00:02:04 's clear, but there's something that even if
00:02:08 you haven't seen your friends for a long time, I
00:02:10 still know it.  You can
00:02:13 keep your friendship, no,
00:02:15 and there's no other option. You only see them once a
00:02:19 year, well, that's what there is, but you know
00:02:23 that people you haven't seen for a year
00:02:26 and then you see them again and it's as
00:02:29 if time hadn't passed then.
00:02:31 xavi with real friends or yes that happens
00:02:35 very often
00:02:37 and there are friends the typical friends
00:02:40 with whom we don't have to talk
00:02:41 every day or every week but
00:02:44 when you do it's as if you
00:02:48 talk every day I don't know  the day
00:02:51 before if it happens to me sometimes I don't know
00:02:55 if it happens to you too what
00:02:58 alas I forgot what I was going to say
00:03:02 well so of course we are people who
00:03:05 have lived in many countries so
00:03:07 we have friends in many places and
00:03:10 this from  Being in contact with all of
00:03:12 them takes work, no, it doesn't happen to you if it's
00:03:16 a job, I mean, it's not that it's hard or
00:03:20 unpleasant, but sometimes I say lol,
00:03:22 I have to talk to the people I met
00:03:25 when I lived in I don't know where it doesn't, it reduces
00:03:27 where it doesn't.  so in the end it's a bit it
00:03:30 was nice to talk to a lot of people
00:03:34 for a while I thought oysters well I
00:03:37 would have to keep in touch more if there comes
00:03:39 a time when I
00:03:42 stop worrying yes and basically
00:03:46 when when I miss someone or
00:03:49 when I think of  someone tells me alone to
00:03:51 see how that person is doing so he
00:03:53 talked to them but well it could be that
00:03:57 's why well there are some friends
00:04:00 who are leaving those of us who are forgetting
00:04:03 and maybe not talking anymore and giving good
00:04:06 truth because to  It happens to me
00:04:11 that what you say is not that sometimes I think of
00:04:13 someone and I want to write to this
00:04:15 person to see what their life is like and
00:04:18 sometimes I do it and sometimes I don't because it makes me
00:04:20 ashamed of the eye I don't know for a long time
00:04:22 We don't talk, not the same, if suddenly
00:04:25 this person talks, he's going to think I don't know what I do
00:04:28 n't know, but I understand very well the
00:04:30 fact that he's embarrassed because
00:04:32 it happened to me with friends from high
00:04:34 school or
00:04:37 maybe we talked or saw each other  sometime
00:04:39 since we started university but
00:04:42 after that we sort of lost
00:04:44 contact yes and I haven't talked I didn't talk for
00:04:47 so long with them I was
00:04:49 ashamed not having talked for so long
00:04:51 with the newspaper to say like you have to
00:04:53 excuse the person first  all
00:04:56 these years I have been missing but
00:04:59 yes but but well despite that there were
00:05:02 some good friends from high
00:05:04 school to reconnect with and well
00:05:06 I'm glad to have reconnected with
00:05:08 them
00:05:09 and I think we shouldn't give us
00:05:11 so much v  embarrassed because when this
00:05:14 happens to me I don't know I get very happy
00:05:17 it happened to me that exempts from my
00:05:19 past not long ago a girl
00:05:22 I went to high school with who was very
00:05:23 nice and with whom I lost contact
00:05:24 because  That's another city, she spoke to me and
00:05:27 said hello, Sandra, I'm already remembering you a
00:05:29 lot. What do you think if when
00:05:32 you return to Spain we meet up and it had been
00:05:35 years since I had spoken to her and the
00:05:36 truth is that I was very happy to know
00:05:38 about her life  She knew you were
00:05:40 abroad
00:05:42 I think yes or maybe not because we
00:05:45 didn't have each other on any social network I think
00:05:47 what you think I already think she didn't have
00:05:51 facebook how did you find
00:05:54 it well because she told me she saw my phone number
00:05:57 in her contacts I still  I had
00:05:59 contacts,
00:06:03 no, I've never changed it, so he said, well,
00:06:06 I'm going to write to sandra to see what's up
00:06:07 and I told her, well, look now I'm in
00:06:09 China but when I get back, well, hey, I
00:06:12 'd love to see you clearly, so I think
00:06:15 that when it happens to me  makes me i  illusion
00:06:16 so we would have to do it more it
00:06:19 is not clear
00:06:21 but there is also the opposite case not of
00:06:23 friendship it is good to you I do not know if it has
00:06:25 happened to me it has happened to me of friends who
00:06:28 disappear
00:06:30 and who specifically stop talking to me
00:06:33 yes I think that happens  and I have and
00:06:40 it has also happened to me that I have done it
00:06:43 but not why not but not of course not
00:06:50 good friends no but well sometimes
00:06:52 the typical thing happens that is or you meet a person
00:06:57 on a trip and well purchasing the typical thing you
00:07:00 talk every day later  It
00:07:03 happens to me sometimes you never make friends because
00:07:06 I don't know very nice ones when you're traveling the
00:07:10 same when you end your lives you talk
00:07:12 every day the same then once a
00:07:16 week every then every I don't know how many
00:07:19 weeks and then every few months and in the
00:07:21 end you stretch out  time it
00:07:26 takes jce to talk to you no so
00:07:28 sometimes it happens to me that sometimes I say let's see
00:07:32 this person this person I'm going to see the
00:07:35 messages that we send each other video- and if I didn't
00:07:37 reply
00:07:38 you know I still forgot because we
00:07:41 left this  rando is not something I do on
00:07:42 purpose anymore sometimes someone sends you
00:07:45 a message but at that moment there is no
00:07:48 time to think about the answer or
00:07:50 whatever if you don't answer and then you can
00:07:52 forget no yes but not many times
00:07:54 I write again sorry  I don't know why I
00:07:56 didn't answer you that I don't like everything I do
00:07:59 n't like to leave people
00:08:02 thinking that they have done wrong or someone
00:08:06 has happened to me, so there are occasions
00:08:08 when friends have specifically
00:08:12 stopped answering me and once it happened
00:08:16 to me with  a boy a boy i knew in
00:08:18 japan
00:08:19 but he was from the usa morales from the usa and
00:08:24 what happened is that i left him a skateboard
00:08:28 and i had it there in japan and when i
00:08:31 left i let him i left it he asked
00:08:33 me he said i can  use this while yes and
00:08:36 I told him well I'll leave it to you
00:08:39 and the plan and what we agreed on is that
00:08:44 well I was going to be traveling for a few months
00:08:46 and that when I returned to Spain he would send it to me
00:08:50 what happens he is a boy in general
00:08:54 very irresponsible
00:08:57 so he was leaving it for
00:08:59 more  forward to
00:09:00 later until he was embarrassed to
00:09:04 talk to me because he had not sent
00:09:06 it to me, okay then I think I did not try to
00:09:12 contact him in various ways by line
00:09:15 and by facebook and however I could and
00:09:19 then he answered me he sent me an
00:09:21 email to  a message or something and well
00:09:24 telling me sorry sorry for being
00:09:27 like that and for not having answered me and such
00:09:30 and come when he could that
00:09:32 he was going to send it to me he was going to
00:09:33 return the skateboard and then
00:09:36 the same thing happened again  Also then he
00:09:38 did leave it for later and such and he
00:09:41 completely cut off contact with this
00:09:46 guy and something similar happened to me with a
00:09:51 friend from Barcelona that we also agreed
00:09:56 to do something
00:10:00 and he couldn't because he was
00:10:03 sick or  whatever
00:10:06 and he thought but he thought that it would not last
00:10:09 long that the problem is the disease
00:10:10 would not last long and that he would be able to
00:10:12 do what he had promised me and such
00:10:14 but later he could not and also because he
00:10:18 had not  what was done because he was ashamed and
00:10:20 not to
00:10:25 mention feeling bad about something he had
00:10:28 promised or because he thought he had to
00:10:30 do something and not do it if the boy
00:10:33 sent me a message also explaining
00:10:36 the issue of the disease and such that I
00:10:38 had neither  idea yes but after that
00:10:41 message again he
00:10:42 has completely cut off communication
00:10:44 and he does not answer me from time to time
00:10:48 I remind him he sends me an email maybe
00:10:49 a new message
00:10:52 every few months to me a message so
00:10:55 that he realizes that I am not here
00:10:57 already angry and you still haven't created and he still
00:11:01 hasn't answered me other than that message
00:11:04 asking me for forgiveness for explaining because he's
00:11:09 still very busy anyway I
00:11:12 don't know I think it's that or I don't know my
00:11:16 wife has the theory that that boy
00:11:19 is  gay and that he liked me but the
00:11:27 shame is enough
00:11:31 we have already said that it happens to us or
00:11:33 whatever
00:11:35 and that of wanting to contact someone and
00:11:36 that for revenge do not dare it has not
00:11:39 happened to you that a good friend or friend does
00:11:41 not  co  before
00:11:45 and well well I think not no I think
00:11:48 it has not happened to me that a real friend
00:11:50 stopped answering me
00:11:52 and those friends of yours were good good or
00:11:55 this this boy and I considered him a good
00:11:58 friend yes but we got along very
00:12:00 well  I considered myself quite a good friend
00:12:02 but it is true that we are not very
00:12:04 connected through other friends,
00:12:06 let's say you no longer belong to the same
00:12:11 group of friends in common or to the same
00:12:16 group, it is more difficult than a person
00:12:22 because I wanted to ask you today what
00:12:26 you consider your  The most important thing for him to
00:12:28 totally ask is to do, because
00:12:31 I think that my definition of friendship has
00:12:35 changed over the years because my
00:12:38 definition of the meaning of
00:12:41 friendship
00:12:43 has changed as I have traveled
00:12:47 because I have realized that
00:12:49 I am always changing from  country
00:12:52 I am living in different countries and
00:12:54 traveling and I always make friends
00:12:58 I always have to make new friends no yes and
00:13:02 then I try to communicate with the
00:13:05 friends I have already made previous  Mind, but
00:13:09 I do, but the time that
00:13:14 passes between the two of you talking always goes by, well,
00:13:15 it stretches, it makes it lower, so well,
00:13:17 my definition of friendship
00:13:21 is now a little special for me now, right
00:13:24 now with the lifestyle that
00:13:27 I lead, I can  Calling a friend someone
00:13:30 I just met a few seconds ago
00:13:33 and with whom I share an
00:13:38 interesting conversation or a nice moment, if not
00:13:41 just a conversation or a moment is
00:13:44 enough and now if that is not clear
00:13:47 why is it that when you travel it happens to
00:13:49 you you meet someone  people every day
00:13:53 out of necessity I have had to change my
00:13:55 definition and I am happy with it and
00:13:57 you who for you who is a good friend of
00:13:59 course this is my definition of a friend from a
00:14:02 good friend friend is different because
00:14:05 good friends
00:14:08 that's right that's right we have to share
00:14:10 Values ​​not what is right and what
00:14:13 is wrong we have to help each other
00:14:17 respect ourselves and also
00:14:19 others if I don't like gossip I don't
00:14:22 like people who talk bad and other
00:14:25 very negligible people  rviosa that is what you do
00:14:30 not like
00:14:32 I did not like it well I do not like that they
00:14:37 are bad people in general that is
00:14:40 good that is, it is not specific to the
00:14:42 friends of any person I am not friends
00:14:45 of a couple
00:14:49 and
00:14:51 yes
00:14:53 I do not know what it is  They laugh at me and not because
00:14:56 they laugh at me and in front of other
00:14:58 people
00:14:59 who use me as a tool, not to have
00:15:02 a laugh or something like that, if they
00:15:04 try to make a fool of you, if they
00:15:07 like to make a fool of yourself, that has
00:15:08 happened to me with other couples.
00:15:12 that with friends with friends it has
00:15:14 happened to me but more when I was little more when I
00:15:16 was at school and I think that when I was
00:15:18 older as an adult
00:15:21 I didn't find many people to do if it
00:15:25 's something more from school but it has happened to me when I was
00:15:28 older with  a girlfriend, of
00:15:34 course, yes, jokes are fine, but
00:15:38 when you make a joke on someone and that
00:15:41 person doesn't take it well, when you
00:15:43 don't like it, then you have to stop
00:15:45 because there are many people who hide behind
00:15:48 and say oh sorry, it was a  joke ok
00:15:54 clear once p  It could be but I still didn't
00:15:57 know but the second time you do
00:15:59 it it's not a joke anymore so you
00:16:03 mentioned that to be good friends it
00:16:06 's important to help each other not yes then I
00:16:10 wanted to talk about loyalty,
00:16:13 how important it is to be loyal to your
00:16:18 friends  that is not the case right now what to say I
00:16:21 would have to think of specific examples
00:16:24 I have already look I am going to ask you
00:16:26 specific questions there are cases in which sometimes
00:16:32 there is a dilemma between loyalty to your
00:16:35 friends
00:16:36 or honesty being honest knowing
00:16:39 ethics no yes in  In the event that a friend,
00:16:42 for example, tells a lie or perhaps
00:16:45 has even stolen something and for you, what
00:16:49 is more important is honesty,
00:16:51 loyalty
00:16:56 to your friends.  be good people
00:16:58 so my friends are not the type of people
00:17:00 who steal or do those things but for
00:17:03 example we are going to put ourselves in the event
00:17:06 that my friends tell me something that they have
00:17:09 done something not very good
00:17:11 and they ask me for my opinion then  but I also
00:17:17 always try to
00:17:25 support my friends so I do
00:17:28 tell them the truth, I tell them
00:17:31 because sometimes your friends expect that
00:17:34 when you  say something that supports them yes
00:17:37 or yes no tell them nothing happens everything
00:17:40 is fine but what I'm trying to
00:17:41 say is clear but what I'm trying to say
00:17:45 is honestly I don't think you've been
00:17:49 correct I think what you've done
00:17:51 is not right but  well we are friends and I
00:17:54 will support you if that is the case I hope
00:17:59 to see this in things not like stealing or
00:18:03 doing they don't know little things in
00:18:06 behaviors maybe not well with this
00:18:08 person I have had this discussion and blah
00:18:10 blah blah
00:18:11 I say well I sincerely believe that in
00:18:13 this discussion you were not right I think
00:18:16 that I think that you have both done it
00:18:18 because sometimes people think that the
00:18:20 other has always done it more than the other
00:18:22 person has done it wrong and you have
00:18:24 done it wrong too
00:18:25 but hey we are friends and we are not  or I'm going to
00:18:27 stop being your friend but
00:18:30 I don't know if I'm quite similar to you
00:18:34 I was thinking of situations in
00:18:37 which it's not only me and my friend but
00:18:40 we are in a situation in which
00:18:41 my friend is telling other people
00:18:44 Well, something that is not is not true or something is
00:18:46 not
00:18:46 difficult for me. It is very difficult for me to support my
00:18:52 friends in the face of things that I know
00:18:54 are not true, things about you or well, it
00:18:56 is about other people, it is things about maybe
00:18:58 that have nothing to do with it.  about me no if it
00:19:02 doesn't mean that I'm going to say
00:19:03 no that's not true you didn't do that you
00:19:06 didn't and whatever no but but it bothers me a
00:19:10 lot if it happened to me for example it also happened to me
00:19:13 in japan going to a karaoke and
00:19:17 We went to a karaoke and a large group
00:19:19 of friends arrived
00:19:22 and they weren't very close friends, I mean,
00:19:25 there were maybe two or three people
00:19:27 I knew and then there were also
00:19:28 some other people, it was the first
00:19:31 time I'd seen them, but they decided to say
00:19:35 that  we were less people than we
00:19:36 were  It's really to pay less,
00:19:43 well, I don't like it at all, but they also
00:19:45 decided that I was going to be one of the
00:19:48 people who had to hide and
00:19:51 so they wouldn't tell me, no, and well, I didn't
00:19:54 like that
00:19:56 at all, that has happened to me too, yes.  Those
00:19:59 things, for example, I remember not long
00:20:02 ago in China, I went with some friends to
00:20:05 dinner
00:20:07 and they brought a bill and we saw how good
00:20:11 they saw that there wasn't any, they
00:20:14 hadn't charged us for two things and they said
00:20:19 oh look, this hasn't been free  and he says
00:20:21 I don't forgive this, this is not free, and
00:20:24 I, the waiter and Sandra, were a group of
00:20:29 seven people, and the other six did not
00:20:31 want to say anything. In the end, I had to
00:20:32 shut up and also,
00:20:34 yes, I mean, of course, nor ethics, he tells me to see
00:20:37 If someone to me if someone does not
00:20:40 charge me something or is wrong I say so but
00:20:43 I was against six people and besides
00:20:45 they were not they were not friends friends it was that I
00:20:48 knew him
00:20:51 so they forced me to shut up
00:20:55 yes well I think that you and I are we can
00:20:59 be  friends friends and friends so
00:21:05 bu  Well, what do you think about lending money to
00:21:09 your friends?
00:21:11 Yes, it's something I hadn't done until
00:21:15 recently at Molina and the thing is that I,
00:21:19 for example, have never asked
00:21:20 anyone for money at all because I think, and to my credit,
00:21:24 my economic conditions are not very
00:21:28 good for him for family reasons that is,
00:21:32 I am not one of those who would have to
00:21:34 ask for money I go and I have never asked for it
00:21:37 because I think that let's see if I don't have money
00:21:41 to have there are things that I can
00:21:43 not afford I am not going to live above
00:21:46 my chances
00:21:49 and if I want to buy something and I don't have
00:21:52 money at that moment, it's my fault, I
00:21:53 should have saved up.
00:21:58 I want to buy something,
00:22:02 I shouldn't have to know, and so I never
00:22:05 asked anyone for money, but
00:22:07 in the last year there have been people who have asked me
00:22:10 money three different people
00:22:12 and I know what it costs to say no to
00:22:19 friends and well they are good friends
00:22:22 that I trusted that is to say I did not
00:22:25 care symbolic I would not do it but
00:22:27 well they
00:22:29 are friends that I trusted and I knew
00:22:31 that I knew  that they would return it to me and they are
00:22:34 good people I know that they are good people they are
00:22:36 people that,
00:22:38 how good they asked me for different
00:22:40 reasons,
00:22:43 no problem, not in fact, in one case
00:22:46 I told a friend, look, don't
00:22:48 give it back to me if you want, and then in the end
00:22:50 she  Now it's rocks
00:22:58 I told him yes and he told me I'll give it back to you I said it
00:23:00 's that he was already having a bad time
00:23:02 and it's not that I had a lot of money
00:23:05 but hey I told him look
00:23:10 I had a bad experience because there are
00:23:13 people who have bad experiences and sometimes they don't
00:23:15 There are people who leave money and
00:23:17 then for the money because friendships are broken
00:23:21 without truth and the south is a
00:23:23 shame in my case it has not happened to me there is only
00:23:27 one person who owes me money
00:23:31 who was a co-worker in
00:23:34 Spain
00:23:37 I don't remember how  It was the thing,
00:23:41 yes, but outside it was a bit, it was like
00:23:45 forty euros or something like that,
00:23:46 yes, then this guy
00:23:49 we just lost contact and such, but I don't
00:23:52 consider it as a
00:23:53 friendship breaking up over money, the only
00:23:57 time they've asked me for money.  A lot of money was
00:23:59 a classmate, a boy who was also Spanish
00:24:02 when we were studying in
00:24:04 California we were both doing a
00:24:06 master's degree in the US and well I understand
00:24:12 that when we were there we
00:24:15 had a scholarship, it will be a scholarship only for the
00:24:18 first year
00:24:20 [Music]
00:24:22 and it can be good  that you are in the
00:24:24 situation that perhaps you have to
00:24:25 pay something for the university and
00:24:29 recently you had to turn off the car or something
00:24:31 because you needed the car for your life
00:24:33 there and well it may be that you need a
00:24:35 little more money so this was a
00:24:38 part  It was not considerable, it was not a month
00:24:41 's salary but it was a good portion of
00:24:44 a month's salary
00:24:46 and he asked me for a few weeks that he did not
00:24:49 need a few weeks until he
00:24:50 received the next salary from the bee,
00:24:53 so I had no problems, I
00:24:56 also knew that he was going  to receive the
00:24:59 scholarship he will be able to pay me and I
00:25:02 also trusted him and well and he
00:25:04 returned it to me without problems and without taking a
00:25:07 long time yes but I understand that
00:25:10 even people who  I consider them friends
00:25:13 I consider them friends because well I
00:25:17 like to spend time with them I consider them
00:25:18 to be good people who will
00:25:21 not hurt me on purpose but there are some
00:25:24 friends that I consider are not
00:25:26 very responsible people yes and if they
00:25:30 ask me for a lot of money  Maybe I would think about it
00:25:32 clearly if luckily those who have asked me
00:25:35 were responsible people
00:25:38 that I trust but I wouldn't know what to
00:25:39 do either well they have asked me for money four
00:25:41 times this year four more than four
00:25:44 times but I was not responsible but  The one
00:25:49 who wasn't very responsible asked me a
00:25:51 little but
00:25:56 once has it happened to you
00:25:59 that a friend has done something that you didn't
00:26:02 expect that has damaged you in some way
00:26:04 that you didn't expect. It
00:26:09 hasn't happened to me that I was alive or this person
00:26:11 has betrayed me.  I also see a
00:26:14 lot on social networks in people who
00:26:16 comment on those you least expect that
00:26:19 betray you yes no well
00:26:21 yes well no no no no that it gets
00:26:25 so far is the worst
00:26:27 I think that of the times that I find myself the most
00:26:29 angry with people I considered
00:26:31 friends it was with the guy who
00:26:34 stayed on the skateboard I hope you
00:26:36 enjoy it I still did it he must not
00:26:39 have
00:26:44 the skateboard it was because of the skateboard
00:26:47 that you get angry although I tell you that you get
00:26:51 angry but you were disappointed
00:26:53 yes  Yes, I was quite disappointed and well,
00:26:55 since then, since I left Japan,
00:26:57 we haven't seen each other in person again,
00:26:59 so since then it's always been
00:27:01 communication, well, by message,
00:27:05 and what happened to
00:27:08 you, I don't know, I think the boyfriend has been stolen.
00:27:12 below
00:27:13 what I know no no no no no no
00:27:18 I don't think they have
00:27:20 disappointed me in some way
00:27:24 I don't know if I don't remember now I think
00:27:26 something very big hasn't happened to me something very
00:27:29 important you don't have when you were on
00:27:33 the web  to know that some friend was
00:27:35 saying bad things
00:27:38 yes yes because at school I don't know
00:27:43 it happened to me because now this being
00:27:46 different is kind of cool but when I
00:27:49 was little being different was not
00:27:50 cool so in ways d  iferent, well,
00:27:55 look
00:27:56 at my school or yes, well, at that
00:28:00 time I thought that it was like that all over the
00:28:02 world because what I knew was the
00:28:04 environment of my school, no, well,
00:28:08 people still go a lot for
00:28:10 appearances, not for clothes, for money
00:28:14 and I wasn't like that and
00:28:17 people's favorite pastime was to talk bad
00:28:20 about people, I said I didn't like that
00:28:23 so I never participated in that and that's
00:28:26 why I was weird because I didn't
00:28:28 like to talk bad about people or
00:28:30 insulting and I didn't like to say that, I mean,
00:28:33 I remember the girls in my class when they were
00:28:35 7 years old, looking at someone and saying, oh,
00:28:40 surely their father earns a lot of money because
00:28:42 look, we stole Buenavista, that is,
00:28:44 they consent. I didn't know if my parents
00:28:47 earned a lot of little money.  I wasn't even 7
00:28:49 and 17, that is, I was a co-participant, so
00:28:58 I don't know, I always felt weird, not
00:29:02 because Diego is like that all over the world, I don't know
00:29:05 why I have to find my place and I
00:29:06 think that's why I decided to travel with this
00:29:09 because it said  young people who
00:29:10 You never know and no, so no, no, no,
00:29:14 nothing, very strange, it
00:29:15 just didn't seem to me, well, I thought
00:29:18 about ethics, it didn't seem to me according to my
00:29:20 values, well, judging people based on things
00:29:23 like that, for example, if not,
00:29:28 everyone  like this there were also good
00:29:30 people in the high school or worse in
00:29:37 the high school or school I am
00:29:39 referring in general to the education not
00:29:42 of an adolescent girl sushi and I did
00:29:45 not like that at all and well I tried to be on
00:29:48 my own I prefer I don't know I prefer is that
00:29:52 that  No, it doesn't seem like something ethical to me, or something
00:29:56 good, well, I prefer not to participate, but
00:29:59 well, but that's good if I was later in
00:30:03 another
00:30:04 institute when I was 17 and 18 years old and the people were
00:30:07 different and the Bolt people were not
00:30:09 like that in Spain the last two years before.
00:30:13 from the university is the baccalaureate
00:30:15 there are people who perhaps in their
00:30:18 institute do not do or do not do the type of
00:30:20 baccalaureate that they want to do
00:30:22 are the two years prior to
00:30:24 university and well after that I no
00:30:27 longer had a problem finding  Find
00:30:29 more similar people I think it was the goal the
00:30:31 type of school where the
00:30:33 people who went to that school were, not that I
00:30:36 was very good, it's not that if I was
00:30:38 weird
00:30:40 you still have friends for that reason from the
00:30:43 institute
00:30:46 of the first school  I went to, well, not
00:30:50 many I would say, but the girl until
00:30:52 she contacted me recently was from that school
00:30:55 and she was a good girl, yes, but she was not from
00:30:58 my city. She was a girl, but she was from my
00:30:59 city and she arrived at the institute a little
00:31:02 late and  it was very good
00:31:05 [Music]
00:31:08 I don't know if it has ever happened to
00:31:12 think that you don't fit in the same way it has
00:31:13 happened to all of us in different ways
00:31:18 since I was little I have always been quite an
00:31:21 introvert yes also
00:31:25 and it seems that being an introvert is a
00:31:29 bad thing if not even when I'm older  Already in
00:31:34 the current university I met
00:31:36 people who, how they make you feel bad out
00:31:38 of jealousy for not being extroverted and
00:31:40 not talking constantly, well,
00:31:48 thank you very much, it seems that it has already been
00:31:50 done, it has become dark if it is the
00:31:53 weather  or I'm already realizing it's that
00:31:55 the weather is terrible it's raining
00:31:57 there's no light at all we've been losing the
00:32:05 day it's very changeable here in Santander it
00:32:07 's good I was having a great day this
00:32:09 morning then it's been sunny and now it's
00:32:10 raining
00:32:13 thank you very much for helping us thank you  to
00:32:17 you for the ideas we have shared
00:32:20 and let's see if we can record another video another day
00:32:25 bye bye

00:00:03 like it a lot today again we are going to look at
00:00:07 memes hello well yes again we are going
00:00:12 to see what is interesting in the
00:00:16 networks do not see this is simply a lot of
00:00:19 work a very big effort it is all
00:00:23 a computer  the cover of a computer has been
00:00:27 made like a card or a card
00:00:32 not a card to play pokemon from the
00:00:34 pokemon game don't see it's a lot a lot of
00:00:37 work
00:00:39 has received the oculus quest they have
00:00:42 released the quest 2 the second version
00:00:45 of which I  I have and the truth is that they are
00:00:48 very cool I really like this one
00:00:50 is very good and the child is good as
00:00:53 if you were little I think that
00:00:57 when I received the megadrive it was
00:01:00 something similar if you received
00:01:03 perhaps a super nintendo or a
00:01:05 nintendo 64 or a
00:01:09 playstation well surely you would be the same you are
00:01:12 rats when she moves the cape and steps on
00:01:16 the box that is a guinea pig I think it is
00:01:21 a guinea pig dancing reggaeton well it
00:01:25 's funny that I just love it I
00:01:29 love it  the high places the
00:01:31 strong impressions
00:01:32 I would like to go down
00:01:36 this slide
00:01:38 I would love it if I don't know where it is I don't know
00:01:40 where it is
00:01:43 what they are doing they are applying glue in
00:01:45 class in good finger glue of
00:01:51 course the glues don't come off what
00:01:55 it does
00:01:58 what  they are going to do
00:02:03 no they are not they are not very smart
00:02:08 how bad I miss the snow it's
00:02:12 been a lot good last winter
00:02:16 yes we went to the snow but I didn't go
00:02:19 skiing or snowboarding and I miss it a lot
00:02:24 don't see anesthesia for  hedgehogs of course
00:02:27 you don't want a hedgehog to get angry no and
00:02:30 maybe if you try to prick it it
00:02:33 will hurt you and they put it all inside one
00:02:37 like a glass bell and they put
00:02:40 gas on it I suppose they put gas on it to
00:02:42 anesthetize it so that later they can
00:02:45 operate on it  time he does he is cutting
00:02:48 cake
00:02:50 in a glass and he is going to eat it in the
00:02:54 glass yes good if it does not work
00:02:59 today
00:03:02 if it is a solution if you are out you are
00:03:06 having a picnic and you do not have knives
00:03:09 or separate plates then what  You put it
00:03:11 directly into the glass, of course, I
00:03:14 do have a knife, but I don't take glasses
00:03:16 when I go on a picnic I don't take glass glasses,
00:03:18 so it's not very practical, of
00:03:21 course, now you don't have glasses for the
00:03:23 lambrusco, little girl, no,
00:03:27 the oregano has fallen and it's going to  suck of course
00:03:32 how clever sucked all the egg he has
00:03:36 put in it you haven't seen it he has put
00:03:37 too much oregano oregano oregano or
00:03:40 basil or whatever he
00:03:43 is not very clever but well it is clear
00:03:45 that he has already done it to make a joke
00:03:48 no what is this basil
00:03:51 [Applause] let's
00:03:52 see this because he's drawing the
00:03:57 outline of the dog and he says it's good to
00:04:00 give a dog no the drawing will be a
00:04:02 dog
00:04:04 no the drawing I know I don't know what
00:04:07 the drawing is no dogs on the beach
00:04:11 dogs are prohibited and  Here, well, the
00:04:14 cats are enjoying themselves without the dogs, they
00:04:18 have the beach all to themselves and they
00:04:21 can sunbathe and do whatever
00:04:23 they want without being bothered,
00:04:29 the dog doesn't walk
00:04:31 [Music] You
00:04:35 have to make her voice, I don't know, maybe
00:04:38 at home she talks to her  so
00:04:43 when he starts talking like a
00:04:46 voice for children then walk the earth
00:04:51 don't wait
00:04:54 the girl always has to go down the
00:04:57 street
00:04:58 talking to her talking to her like this this is very
00:05:01 typical I didn't find my cat disappeared
00:05:04 and I put it in the house but there my cat is
00:05:08 back  now I have two identical cats
00:05:11 I have already seen this with several cats I
00:05:13 don't know if people already know if it is true or
00:05:17 not true and they look for a friend with the
00:05:20 same type of cat and they bring him but but
00:05:23 well the story is funny no yes
00:05:25 It was true, let's see, they are in a zoom class, they
00:05:28 are all coordinating
00:05:31 to do a choreography like one does.
00:05:36 I don't know if this is a meme, now if
00:05:39 people have started to do this, but
00:05:42 well, like the classes like this, with so many
00:05:45 people, the zoom is  something recent,
00:05:48 maybe it is something that has become fashionable
00:05:50 now, at least staying at home'
00:05:52 you save money at home buying a
00:05:55 lot of things online no yes it is
00:05:58 true that because of the pandemic and
00:06:01 if there is confinement or in  In general,
00:06:04 people stay at home more because you don't
00:06:06 spend on certain things, but it's very
00:06:09 easy to start
00:06:11 ordering food at home and spend a lot of
00:06:14 money like that, and of course, buying
00:06:16 online, buying on Amazon, because it's very
00:06:19 easy to buy many things very quickly,
00:06:22 since you're not paying  in cash with
00:06:25 bills also you don't realize much
00:06:28 of how much money you have spent in total and it
00:06:31 's easy to spend a lot
00:06:36 this is an awesome drone view
00:06:39 a video recorded from a drone of
00:06:42 course before we had drones we
00:06:45 could never really record images like this
00:06:48 it didn't exist yet  a plane or a helicopter
00:06:51 so small to be able to record things
00:06:55 like that so so spectacular and well it has
00:06:58 to be good the person has to be
00:07:00 very skillful driving the drone so as
00:07:04 not to break it so as not to crash into
00:07:07 something nice I want to go to the snow again
00:07:10 I have already told you before but I want to
00:07:12 be in such a beautiful place only
00:07:16 when there is snow the rest of the year I want to
00:07:18 be on the beach and with heat  But
00:07:20 when it snows it's really nice when
00:07:23 all the spoons are dirty and you
00:07:25 don't want to clean one if you've ever
00:07:28 lived the life of living alone or
00:07:31 maybe living in a shared flat and it's all
00:07:35 dirty you don't have spoons or teaspoons
00:07:39 to use that are clean or  maybe not
00:07:42 so exaggerated this is with a ladle or
00:07:44 something very big but maybe use a
00:07:48 tablespoon for something that you need
00:07:52 a dessert spoon or a
00:07:54 coffee teaspoon because if ever maybe maybe
00:07:56 yes using a tablespoon
00:07:59 is not making the dog talk  save
00:08:12 how good the parakeet with the skateboard
00:08:14 with the little tech like
00:08:17 these toy skateboards the toy skates
00:08:21 he is very good at it the parakeet seems to have
00:08:24 fun this happens to me yes what happens to
00:08:27 me with these in jorhat the ear
00:08:31 He has the glasses, the mask, the
00:08:35 earrings, two earrings, three
00:08:37 earrings, and the headset.
00:08:40 I don't have so many things, but only
00:08:43 with the headphones, wearing the
00:08:47 headset and  wearing the mask
00:08:50 I never know how to take it all off I don't know if I
00:08:53 put on the mask first and then the
00:08:55 headset I have to take off
00:08:58 the headset first and then the
00:09:00 mask but if I wear the
00:09:03 headset and then I put on the
00:09:06 mask then I have to remember to
00:09:08 take it off first  the mask and then
00:09:10 the headphones or I can't take the
00:09:13 headset off the headset stays here
00:09:15 dangling from here and then I
00:09:19 can put it back on well it's also
00:09:21 comfortable no but if I put the
00:09:26 mask on first then the headphones
00:09:29 then I forget and I  I remove the
00:09:32 mask then
00:09:35 the headphones get all tangled up and the mask stays
00:09:38 all tangled up there and I have to untangle
00:09:41 the problems of 2020 2021 I hope

140,"00:00:00 hello how are you friends of gaming
00:00:02 hispanic
00:00:03 I am sergio martínez and I am very
00:00:05 happy to be with all
00:00:07 of you today I am very very very
00:00:11 happy as I had already told you and this
00:00:13 is for a reason in the first video
00:00:16 that you  I sent and in the one that you
00:00:17 met me I told you that I was doing
00:00:19 an audition fortunately I
00:00:23 kept that audition and that is why
00:00:25 today I am speaking to you again
00:00:29 i
00:00:29 [Music]
00:00:32 ah
00:00:33 and thinking about that
00:00:35 it occurred to me that it would be good to
00:00:37 talk to you about one  A small continuation of
00:00:40 what happened after the auditions.
00:00:43 On this occasion, I was talking about how
00:00:45 difficult it is to organize and put together
00:00:48 a play or a small presentation so
00:00:52 that the people who are going to see you
00:00:53 know who they are working
00:00:56 with. However, what happens next if you had
00:00:59 a bit of bad luck they will tell you that you
00:01:03 are not what they are looking for and
00:01:04 you will have to continue working
00:01:07 however if you are lucky enough to be
00:01:09 accepted and told to continue then  ces
00:01:11 begins a new adventure and that is
00:01:14 what I am here to talk about today
00:01:16 in my little career as an actor I have had
00:01:19 the opportunity to participate in three
00:01:21 different companies in three companies
00:01:26 in the first one it was a lot of fun we did
00:01:29 a play in which I was a
00:01:32 family and then I was the
00:01:34 crazy and strange son my character looked
00:01:39 quite funny it was a
00:01:41 comedy and I really liked you will participate
00:01:43 however after this I continued
00:01:46 learning on my own and I continued
00:01:49 preparing to play a character that
00:01:51 I have always liked  the clowns do
00:01:54 remember that I had already mentioned them
00:01:56 to you the previous time I am a clown for
00:01:59 life
00:02:00 so in the next company
00:02:02 I was in I was very excited to be a
00:02:05 clown again and fortunately
00:02:07 I was given the opportunity so I
00:02:10 I joined a show called humanity and
00:02:13 there I played a musician clown.
00:02:16 Fortunately I have a little video
00:02:19 of what I did with them so that
00:02:21 you can see it  see because it really
00:02:23 makes me very excited that they know the
00:02:25 work that I did, so I'll just leave
00:02:27 a little bit for you to see what
00:02:32 you did, you know, I don't need my nose
00:02:36 [Applause]
00:02:42 As you can see it's a lot of fun
00:02:44 working with people  and that people
00:02:46 can see what you do, what you think, and
00:02:50 above all, that you are available
00:02:53 to entertain other people, which
00:02:55 in a certain way is a bit of what we
00:02:57 are doing at this moment,
00:03:00 I also want to tell you that this was
00:03:02 the first opportunity  that I had with
00:03:04 that company called the horde of the
00:03:06 crow children with whom we did
00:03:08 many other works and I want to
00:03:11 talk to you about this in a particular way
00:03:13 since sometimes we have challenges in life that
00:03:16 we don't know how to face but that in the
00:03:19 long run are quite  beneficial for
00:03:21 us an example of this and what
00:03:24 I want to tell you is that after we
00:03:26 finished this first show
00:03:28 called humanity we started working
00:03:31 on another called j  onás jonás had several
00:03:34 peculiarities, one of the ones that I
00:03:37 liked the most is that it was a slightly
00:03:39 more serious work, although it had touches of humor,
00:03:42 most of them were strong scenes, a
00:03:46 little bit adult, but it was very
00:03:50 interesting
00:03:52 in this work, there was a very
00:03:54 particular character who  His name was Venus, he was
00:03:57 a man who dressed as a woman, so
00:03:59 after going through a great
00:04:02 personal process to see if I could work
00:04:05 with that character, I got to
00:04:08 work. I learned to walk in very high heels,
00:04:10 to move my hips to dance.
00:04:14 differently from how I usually dance
00:04:18 to change my way of talking about moving
00:04:21 and everything
00:04:23 I want to show you, I just want to show you a
00:04:25 photograph of how I looked in those
00:04:28 shows, since unfortunately I don't have a
00:04:31 video of that, although a photo is enough,
00:04:36 so I want to show you  so
00:04:38 that you can see how I looked in those
00:04:40 times
00:04:46 and well after that acting challenge it was
00:04:49 my turn to be the main character
00:04:51 in another play although I was much
00:04:54 calmer  Uila, since I would go out dressed as
00:04:57 a bad man and that was my character being
00:04:59 a bad man and that was much easier
00:05:01 to do
00:05:02 and what I want to tell you about today
00:05:04 is precisely that, there are times when it
00:05:07 is very difficult for us to start
00:05:10 something like we say here.  that this is
00:05:13 how to dare and that we are not always
00:05:16 sure how it will go or how it will
00:05:19 turn out but the only way we
00:05:21 can know is by doing it I have
00:05:24 found myself on the verge of
00:05:27 trying something many times and with great fear with
00:05:30 doubts with  fears and without knowing exactly
00:05:33 what I should do but I have
00:05:36 heard a phrase that I love and that
00:05:39 says that when you are taking the first
00:05:41 step the rest will be much easier
00:05:44 so I want to thank
00:05:46 all of you for the  Today
00:05:48 you are here with me because
00:05:51 you are already on a path that not
00:05:53 many people dare and it is that the
00:05:56 Spanish language is very complicated
00:05:58 more than many people think so
00:06:01 if you allow me  iten we are going to continue
00:06:03 working together so that this
00:06:05 community grows and that we all continue
00:06:07 learning from each other

182,"00:00:00 Marifer, what are you going to tell us about? Today I
00:00:04 am going to tell you about my
00:00:06 wonderful experience getting to know
00:00:08 Machu Picchu in Peru. Hello Marifer, hello
00:00:17 Pablo, how are you doing very well? Me too, thank you very
00:00:21 much. Yes, Marifer, you are going
00:00:24 to talk to us about Machu Picchu, but you
00:00:26 also make videos on YouTube.  That's right,
00:00:29 I'm already one of the
00:00:31 Spanish teachers of the sprints pérez
00:00:34 channel, a spring Spanish YouTube channel with
00:00:37 several teachers is worth it, that's also the way it is, we are
00:00:40 five teachers, four Mexican and a
00:00:43 teacher from Venezuela where we teach
00:00:45 Spanish through chats, so
00:00:48 at least  I have seen you have several videos
00:00:52 about expressions about grammar but
00:00:56 now you are starting to make videos
00:00:58 also only in Spanish, so we
00:01:02 realized that there are different levels
00:01:04 of Spanish and they also wanted to
00:01:07 take advantage of this type of content
00:01:10 to learn about the different
00:01:13 cultural accents but through  of
00:01:15 real conversations very well, if you like marifer
00:01:19 and want to listen more to marifer or  I leave
00:01:22 the link below in the
00:01:24 description for you to visit his channel
00:01:27 but now I want you to talk to me about Machu
00:01:30 Picchu Marifer because I have never been
00:01:33 to Machu Picchu well yes you have
00:01:35 missed a great wonder Pablo is an
00:01:38 impressive place no I have
00:01:42 long enough that when I went no no no no no
00:01:45 to forget I would love to even
00:01:48 return to that beautiful place yes this
00:01:52 is in peru true yes it is so it
00:01:55 is in cusco no the capital is lima but
00:02:00 to get to machu picchu you have to take
00:02:02 a  bus a train or even if you have
00:02:07 found out
00:02:08 you can do it walking if I was
00:02:11 researching a bit
00:02:13 about the ways to get there that there are
00:02:16 taller adventurous people who walk the last
00:02:18 stretch it doesn't seem incredible it is
00:02:21 quite isolated from the rest no yes in
00:02:26 fact they call it the  Inca Trail The
00:02:29 Inca is the native person of Peru,
00:02:33 the indigenous people, and it seems to me, as you say,
00:02:38 very adventurous, but I prefer the train.
00:02:44 You went by train, that's right. I took the train
00:02:48 to p  To get to the holy city is
00:02:51 ok and this train is a very long journey
00:02:54 no really and I think you're enjoying
00:02:58 the scenery so it's a great
00:03:01 opportunity to distract yourself you don't have to
00:03:05 go back by train you can go back by
00:03:07 bus so you can have
00:03:10 different views during your trip
00:03:13 So there is Machu Picchu, well,
00:03:16 explain to us a little first
00:03:19 what Machu Picchu is. I'm going to tell you
00:03:21 how I understood it. There is probably an
00:03:25 expert Peruvian who can tell you the
00:03:28 history of Machu Picchu.
00:03:31 It is
00:03:34 not Pablo I am Mexican
00:03:37 I am from the southeast of Mexico if we
00:03:40 explain it that sometimes to the students
00:03:42 they want to know what accent the
00:03:45 person speaks yes with pleasure I am from
00:03:49 Mexico from the city of Veracruz which
00:03:52 is in the southeast of  Mexico, where
00:03:54 the gulf is precisely, so we
00:03:57 have the beach,
00:03:59 so how do you
00:04:02 understand what Machu Picchu is? Machu
00:04:05 Picchu was a sacred place for me,
00:04:08 Mr.  Well, in the past, the Incas
00:04:11 also did their
00:04:14 religious or religious ceremonies according to
00:04:19 what they believed at that time, well,
00:04:22 don't you realize that in
00:04:24 Latin America there is also a culture of
00:04:27 the pyramids, so in different
00:04:30 ways for Miguel Amaya applied that's how it is
00:04:34 in fact  In Mexico there are a lot thousands
00:04:37 of pyramids throughout the country and what
00:04:40 I found wonderful was the location
00:04:42 and how it is built because when
00:04:47 you arrive at the place you can't imagine how they
00:04:50 built that
00:04:52 or like the pyramids of Giza in
00:04:54 Egypt, not that they seem impossible to
00:04:57 build, well, machu picchu is still
00:05:01 entering the mountain and it seems that it
00:05:05 is built in a hole or in a
00:05:08 deep part. For me, the most
00:05:12 impressive thing has been the serenity that
00:05:17 one feels there because it is on top of
00:05:20 a mountain in a like a  peak that is, it
00:05:24 is not perhaps the highest mountain in the area,
00:05:26 so it is not the highest mountain in the area
00:05:29 because in fact one of the most
00:05:31 popular photos of machu picc  hu is with a
00:05:34 mountain behind it but if it is very high
00:05:38 in fact I tell you that something curious is that
00:05:41 those people who suffer from more
00:05:44 height are not recommended to go up to
00:05:46 Machu Picchu oh yes because there is one there is a
00:05:51 town at the base they do not recommend going
00:05:54 first a day or two in the town to
00:05:56 get used to it if it is true and in fact
00:05:59 this is curious because those who
00:06:02 suffer from altitude sickness recommend
00:06:05 chewing thief coca leaves no it
00:06:09 has nothing to do with drugs but they are
00:06:11 called coca leaves  coca or the coca tea
00:06:14 from where they get the drug, they don't get it
00:06:18 from those leaves yes I think so I think so
00:06:20 but of course it's just a way
00:06:25 of not having this dysfunction
00:06:28 of altitude sickness that you are
00:06:30 chewing or you can take it  In tea and in
00:06:34 Peru they call it mate if it is a leaf that was
00:06:37 traditionally consumed, not
00:06:40 by the inhabitants of the Andes. It
00:06:42 seems to me that if I wasn't there I wasn't
00:06:46 very aware of how they did the
00:06:50 mate but I remember what  And it is even rich
00:06:53 and it is good for your health. I brought a
00:06:55 little from Mexico so that I could continue
00:06:58 tasting it, since in my country there is none,
00:07:00 so you say that Machu Picchu can't
00:07:04 imagine how they could build it,
00:07:06 perhaps carrying rocks to such a place.
00:07:09 high no if it is
00:07:12 really impressive but you have no idea I invite
00:07:14 you that if you have the opportunity to
00:07:17 attend places in Latin America Machu
00:07:19 Picchu be one of them yes yes I think
00:07:23 it is the first place the place
00:07:25 I would most like to go from  South America, how is
00:07:28 the way to go
00:07:30 up there, once you arrive at the place,
00:07:32 as if they try to take care of it because you
00:07:35 know that Machu Picchu is a
00:07:37 UNESCO World Heritage Site
00:07:39 so they try to take great care of the
00:07:43 area and this part  I don't believe you, as it
00:07:47 is still paved so there are
00:07:50 people who do have difficulty and
00:07:53 even have the name of the cane
00:07:57 you use to do mountaineering
00:08:00 because I don't remember its name or I never would.
00:08:03 I've been busy I don't know
00:08:09 if then with that vast people it
00:08:11 supports because ours is a street it's
00:08:16 more like a path that is paved
00:08:19 because it has a lot of stones they are like
00:08:22 stone steps it's not asphalt but it
00:08:26 's all made with legs that's how it is
00:08:28 then  It is very not that it is dangerous
00:08:32 but maybe if there is some
00:08:34 false stone it can break down and
00:08:39 harm you on the way and you
00:08:41 have to walk up the whole mountain you have to walk up the whole
00:08:43 mountain if not totally there is
00:08:46 no need for example a wheelchair or
00:08:51 someone who in this the truth would not be
00:08:53 convenient there is no way to be able to
00:08:55 move it, that is, it is better to go when you
00:08:59 are still young I do not know if you want that it is the most
00:09:03 recommended but it is totally
00:09:06 worth believing that if you did not get
00:09:09 altitude sickness  You didn't feel sick, no,
00:09:15 but I went with a group and one of them did
00:09:19 have to remember
00:09:21 having a while to sit down and breathe and
00:09:25 we took a guide who is a person who
00:09:28 is specialized and knows the
00:09:30 whole area or the  type of conditions
00:09:34 that can happen to you then
00:09:38 he told him to sit down get some air and for a
00:09:42 while he had to not walk so that he would
00:09:45 be balanced again but out
00:09:48 of there the truth is that one tries
00:09:51 to go slowly or slowly so that you
00:09:56 do not feel this  feeling that you
00:09:59 are out of breath and they say that it can be very
00:10:01 dangerous town if you don't push yourself
00:10:03 too hard for that reason no altitude sickness
00:10:06 due to lack of oxygen yes yes I know that
00:10:10 even people who are not in good
00:10:12 physical condition or healthy can
00:10:15 cause the  Death like this, yes, it is
00:10:18 dangerous. If there was, I know of a story that
00:10:24 has been around for a long time, not from Machu Picchu
00:10:25 but on a mountain in Canada that they
00:10:29 went skiing
00:10:31 and I think that this person had a health problem
00:10:34 and when he arrives at the mountain
00:10:38 for the  more height that is what
00:10:40 caused the death of the person I did not know
00:10:43 either just for that reason I do not see if you do not get
00:10:49 creative with a little nerves then
00:10:53 there in Machu Picchu you say that you felt a
00:10:57 lot of peace that there was  very calm
00:11:00 yes yes it is a place I tell you even though
00:11:04 there are a lot of tourists
00:11:07 with so many tourists
00:11:09 you can feel calm so despite
00:11:12 that there is a kind of
00:11:14 a breeze an air of
00:11:18 tranquility people are not going to shout
00:11:20 there people are going to  relax I had the
00:11:22 opportunity to meditate because I like to
00:11:24 meditate so I stayed there to
00:11:26 enjoy the moment the environment
00:11:30 was really a very nice experience for me
00:11:33 because I really wanted to
00:11:37 know Machu Picchu and being there well
00:11:39 really take advantage of it to enjoy it
00:11:42 to the full as we say in  Mexico
00:11:45 very well I know that from Machu Picchu there is
00:11:49 another mountain that you can climb
00:11:51 where you can take very nice photos
00:11:54 of Machu Picchu you climbed not in our
00:11:58 time it was limited Pablo so we
00:12:00 took advantage of more in the archaeological zone
00:12:03 ok you stayed in the good zone
00:12:07 I think they are, above all, they are temples,
00:12:09 it was not a form of temples, if I tell you, I
00:12:12 think I translate it into a
00:12:15 sacred area for the Incas or if the
00:12:18 sacred city with c  On temples and such I made a
00:12:21 video I already made a video about Machu
00:12:24 Picchu here on the channel and it seems
00:12:27 that it was a sacred city where
00:12:30 sometimes the kings also went to spend
00:12:34 time there I tell you the truth as it
00:12:37 has been around for a long time  I don't remember and in
00:12:39 history but the feeling
00:12:42 and everything I experienced The truth is that Peru
00:12:45 is a wonderful country I not only had
00:12:48 the opportunity to go to Machu Picchu I had
00:12:50 to go to the jungle
00:12:54 and I think they are contrasts but at the same time
00:12:57 a country  that gastronomy can offer you a lot,
00:13:01 the part of nature
00:13:05 and obviously of history with
00:13:08 Machu Picchu, well, yes, I really
00:13:10 want to go to Peru, so not only for
00:13:13 Machu Picchu but also to visit
00:13:15 all those things that you mention and talking
00:13:19 about  gastronomy marifer and I are going to
00:13:22 make a video talking about food I
00:13:25 don't know how to know about Mexican food and I imagine
00:13:28 with you in Spanish not exactly and
00:13:31 then you can go see it on his channel in
00:13:35 spring spanish and well for today we
00:13:38 can  I leave you here thanks marifer
00:13:40 for visiting us for helping me record the
00:13:44 video thanks pablo here and I
00:13:46 really hope it has worked a lot for
00:13:49 the students on your channel
00:13:52 my intention is that they also learn a
00:13:54 little about Latin America and
00:13:57 obviously the Mexican accent maybe
00:14:00 next time  Can you tell us something about
00:14:02 Mexico about your country there with great pleasure I was
00:14:06 delighted to be back of course it is
00:14:08 very good come on marifer bye bye
00:14:15 ah
00:14:17 ah
00:14:19 [Music]
",3
171,"00:00:00 the expression
00:00:03 [Music]
00:00:07 with surprise yes to that you did not expect it
00:00:13 is clear nobody expects the Spanish inquisition well
00:00:19 yes today we are going to talk about the
00:00:21 inquisition we are going to talk about truths
00:00:25 of things that really
00:00:28 were and myths of things that were not  They are not
00:00:33 exactly true
00:00:37 [Music]
00:00:40 Hi, well, yes, we are still in the time
00:00:47 of the Catholic kings and the Habsburgs
00:00:51 have not advanced, no, but we are going to see
00:00:55 another aspect of society at this
00:00:58 time, which is the inquisition, which is
00:01:02 part of religion.  What was at this
00:01:06 time in the kingdoms the kingdoms that in
00:01:09 the future will become Spain
00:01:12 then the inquisition the inquisition
00:01:15 was created in 1478 by the catholic kings
00:01:23 no ferdinando segundo and isabel isabel 1a and it
00:01:31 lasted until 1800
00:01:35 34 thousand 834 then it did last quite a
00:01:42 long time  but today today we are going to end in
00:01:48 1614 because after 1614 he
00:01:56 had less and less power, less and less
00:02:00 influence, so what was the
00:02:03 inquisition?
00:02:05 inquisition what was the
00:02:09 inquisition the inquisition was a
00:02:12 court a court were not judges but it
00:02:17 was a court of the church of the
00:02:21 church of spain which at this time was
00:02:25 only the catholic church well
00:02:29 from a certain moment not in 1478
00:02:34 there were still no other religions  that
00:02:40 Judaism and Islam were allowed so at
00:02:43 first the inquisition only
00:02:47 watched Christians people
00:02:51 who were Christians there were no Christians there were
00:02:55 Christians there were Jews and there were
00:02:59 Muslims no then the inquisition
00:03:03 could only judge
00:03:07 Christians and the inquisition watched that
00:03:12 the  Christians were good Christians
00:03:14 and above all he was watching for heresy
00:03:20 heresy is a serious crime against
00:03:24 religion a very strong crime against the
00:03:27 values ​​of religion
00:03:30 a very typical type of heresy that is to say
00:03:34 being a Christian but in truth continuing to
00:03:37 practice the rites of another religion to
00:03:41 continue  practicing Muslim
00:03:44 or Jewish rites then from 1492 in
00:03:53 1492, as you know, the Jews are thrown out
00:03:57 of Spain, or they leave, they leave Spain, or
00:04:02 they convert to Catholicism or not, and in
00:04:06 1492 the
00:04:10 Muslims are also forced to
00:04:14 convert to Catholicism, the
00:04:17 Muslims could not, they could not leave
00:04:20 spain then from 1492
00:04:27 christianity catholicism was the only
00:04:30 religion allowed in spain' the other
00:04:34 religions
00:04:36 could no longer be practiced
00:04:39 then in practice the
00:04:42 inquisition already had power over the whole world
00:04:46 all the people of spain then
00:04:49 line
00:04:51 Spain was not the first country where there was
00:04:55 an inquisition in other European countries
00:04:58 there had already been an inquisition it is
00:05:00 the first it seems that it was in France
00:05:04 in a region of France where they had
00:05:08 problems with another religion and
00:05:11 normally it was the father the father from Rome
00:05:15 the  that he decided to create inquisitions in
00:05:19 other countries in countries, well, not in the
00:05:22 Catholic world and if there were others, but for
00:05:26 some reason the Spanish inquisition is
00:05:29 the best known and today I am going to explain
00:05:34 why it is the best known thanks to
00:05:37 monty python
00:05:40 well I don't know it may be in part but
00:05:43 but well surely there are more reasons and
00:05:47 today I am going to explain to you the entire
00:05:50 history of the Spanish inquisition
00:05:53 then  I am going to explain it again the
00:05:57 inquisition was a court they were judges
00:06:01 judges who judged people when it was
00:06:06 considered that these people committed
00:06:09 crimes against religion but the
00:06:12 inquisition was not controlled at the
00:06:16 highest level at the highest level it was not
00:06:19 controlled by the church it was not
00:06:22 controlled by priests, not by bishops,
00:06:24 cardinals or by the father, but rather it
00:06:29 was controlled by the kings,
00:06:32 the kings controlled it, normally
00:06:36 the inquisitions in Europe were directed,
00:06:40 the father controlled them, but here in
00:06:43 Spain the Catholic kings
00:06:46 were very friendly with the father, they got along
00:06:50 very well with the father then
00:06:53 as a special favor the father let
00:06:57 them control the inquisition so
00:07:01 why why was it done  because it was created
00:07:03 because what was the reason for the beginnings
00:07:07 of the inquisition in spain then
00:07:10 what was the situation of religions
00:07:14 in spain during the century during the
00:07:18 15th century not
00:07:21 during the 1400s or so during the
00:07:25 middle ages in the kingdoms of spain had
00:07:29 above all there were three religions
00:07:34 Christianity Judaism and Islam and coexistence
00:07:39 was relatively peaceful it was quite
00:07:42 peaceful but in 1391 in 1391 there was
00:07:49 violence against the Jews there was a
00:07:52 lot of violence and a lot of
00:07:55 Jews died and during the 15th century there was
00:08:00 more and more a feeling  against
00:08:03 the Jews and due to this violence
00:08:08 due to this feeling the Jews
00:08:12 began to convert to
00:08:16 Christianity
00:08:17 then before they were forced and
00:08:22 before 1492 many Jews were
00:08:28 already converting to Christianity
00:08:31 also the Jews were prohibited
00:08:34 some things were prohibited
00:08:38 some jobs
00:08:40 were prohibited some positions were
00:08:43 prohibited some official positions
00:08:46 Some jobs in the government some
00:08:50 positions of power were
00:08:52 prohibited and that is another reason
00:08:55 why many had already begun to
00:08:58 convert so when a Jew
00:09:03 converted to Christianity they were called
00:09:06 new Christians the new Christians
00:09:09 and many some some Jews or
00:09:15 Some new Christians reached
00:09:19 important positions in society, they
00:09:21 came to have a lot of power, so
00:09:24 in society they also began to see a
00:09:28 feeling against the new Christians
00:09:32 as a bit of resentment
00:09:36 and I don't know envy, maybe because the Jews
00:09:40 have a reputation for being very hard-working people
00:09:43 and  very intelligent in business and such
00:09:46 I don't know I think the cliché is not the cliché is
00:09:51 that many societies are envious
00:09:55 of the Jews I don't know
00:09:58 exactly why but it seems
00:10:01 that even by those who had already
00:10:03 converted to Christianity well it started  let's
00:10:07 see this feeling of resentment
00:10:10 then in the kingdom of aragon here
00:10:12 we have two kingdoms we don't have aragon  and
00:10:17 we have castilla castilla here there was in
00:10:20 navarra but navarra later
00:10:23 on would become part of aragon also
00:10:25 then in aragon there was
00:10:30 already an inquisition there was already an inquisition in aragon and
00:10:33 this had been set up by the father the father had
00:10:36 established it in rome
00:10:39 in 1478 the catholic kings  They also created an
00:10:47 inquisition in Castile an inquisition was created
00:10:49 because they had found
00:10:53 converts they had found
00:10:56 new Christians who secretly
00:10:59 continued to practice Judaism
00:11:03 and Jewish traditions and this inquisition the
00:11:07 inquisition of Castile was the one that the
00:11:10 father left to the kings who will
00:11:13 administer it  they, who will direct it,
00:11:15 and one of the first things
00:11:19 that this inquisition of Castile did
00:11:23 was take 66 new Christians take
00:11:28 66 new Christians 6 Jewish converts
00:11:32 and burn them burn them alive burn them at
00:11:37 the stake no this was the specialty
00:11:40 of the inquisition was to burn  to people
00:11:42 still alive
00:11:45 and good as it was done in the past
00:11:47 with witches and ta  Well, well, you're going
00:11:51 to see that the Spanish inquisition has
00:11:54 little to do with witches.
00:11:57 Now I'm going to explain it to you
00:11:58 later in the video, so this
00:12:01 inquisition began in the south, it began in
00:12:05 the southern part of Andalusia, in the
00:12:08 southern part of the kingdom of castilla and then it
00:12:11 spread throughout the kingdom of castilla
00:12:14 in aragon it was more difficult because in
00:12:18 aragon there was already an inquisition and
00:12:21 ferdinand the second who was the king of
00:12:24 aragon tried to take control of the
00:12:28 aragon inquisition but there was
00:12:30 resistance if  he did not want the kingdom of
00:12:34 aragon he did not want the king to take
00:12:37 control of the inquisition and the father
00:12:40 was also against the pope of rome
00:12:44 he left the inquisition of castile to the kings
00:12:47 but the one of aragon did not want
00:12:51 and did not want because the father the  Dad
00:12:54 had already realized that with this, with the
00:12:57 inquisition, with these types of crimes
00:13:01 that are so difficult to prove, it was very
00:13:04 easy to blame anyone,
00:13:08 blame your neighbor, say oh no, that's a Jew, that's
00:13:12 still  doing
00:13:13 Jewish traditions and putting him
00:13:17 in jail or being killed it was not very
00:13:20 easy to denounce others without any
00:13:24 proof but finally the king
00:13:27 got it
00:13:28 felipe the second managed to take
00:13:31 control of the inquisition and the father of
00:13:34 rome gave him permission he told him  that's okay and
00:13:37 in this way in fact they got rid
00:13:42 of many new Christians in the
00:13:45 government of aragon they got rid of
00:13:48 many former jews who were
00:13:51 important people in aragon
00:13:53 they got rid of many of them
00:13:56 then from now on and
00:13:59 most of the time almost  all the
00:14:02 time the inquisition of castile and
00:14:05 aragon would be a single entity a single
00:14:10 organization there was only one inquisitor
00:14:14 general the director of the inquisition
00:14:17 was the inquisitor general and
00:14:21 most of the time there was only one
00:14:25 only one only one for the two kingdoms
00:14:29 then between 1480  until 1530
00:14:39 most of the activity of the inquisition
00:14:42 was against new christians or
00:14:46 judeoconversos converts  the majority
00:14:49 of convictions were for this this group
00:14:54 this part of society and at this
00:14:56 time there were
00:14:58 about 2,000 people about 2,000 people
00:15:02 who were executed who were given the
00:15:06 death penalty who were killed not and of
00:15:09 course the inquisition also
00:15:12 kept the properties  Of these people he
00:15:16 kept their houses, he did not keep
00:15:20 their money, so this was also
00:15:25 a very big motivation for the
00:15:27 inquisition to convict convict
00:15:31 many people and also surely the
00:15:36 inquisition played an important role in
00:15:39 what happened in 1492 when  They will throw
00:15:45 the Jews out of Spain surely the
00:15:48 inquisition influenced the kings a lot
00:15:52 to make this decision but
00:15:55 then of course in 1492 when the Jews
00:16:01 had to choose
00:16:03 and leave Spain or convert to
00:16:07 Catholicism because many more
00:16:10 converted many here many Jews
00:16:13 chose to convert  Catholicism and, of
00:16:17 course, there began to be many more
00:16:20 New Catholics, New Christians, and
00:16:24 also much more.  More work for the
00:16:27 inquisition but from 1530
00:16:32 the number of trials dropped considerably under the
00:16:37 number of people convicted
00:16:40 by the inquisition and from 1500 to
00:16:46 1560 the number of
00:16:50 trials for Protestantism began to increase for being a
00:16:53 Protestant for being a Lutheran from
00:16:57 1,560 begins to see many cases of those
00:17:00 because Lutheranism had
00:17:03 begun to spread a lot throughout
00:17:06 Europe
00:17:07 and in Spain it arrived
00:17:10 relatively little, but still well,
00:17:12 there were trials then from
00:17:16 1560 to 1614, which is the end, the
00:17:22 end of the  period that we are going to talk about
00:17:25 today at this time it was mainly the
00:17:29 Protestants the Lutherans I am going to
00:17:32 draw it like this a heart a heart with
00:17:35 a cross inside so the Lutherans
00:17:39 that in this period was mainly the
00:17:43 Lutherans
00:17:45 the Moors the Moors the Moors
00:17:49 were the ones who  They had converted from
00:17:53 Islam to Christianity so it is believed
00:17:57 that about 100 about one hundred hundred people
00:18:00 also burned them too.  They were also
00:18:04 burned for practicing Lutheranism
00:18:07 for being Protestants so in addition to
00:18:12 trials of judging people of
00:18:15 convicting people, well, the sentences or there has been
00:18:18 talk of deaths, but many sentences,
00:18:20 the majority were prison
00:18:23 sentences, prison sentences, there
00:18:27 were also many sentences of  depression
00:18:29 then in addition to these trials of
00:18:32 these sentences the inquisition also
00:18:36 prohibited books it prohibited certain books it
00:18:40 had lists of books that
00:18:43 were prohibited in these books
00:18:46 translations of the bible were included
00:18:49 translations into
00:18:52 spanish translations into the spoken language of
00:18:55 the people because this  It was another thing
00:18:58 that confronted the Catholics with the
00:19:01 Lutherans, not the Catholic Church believed
00:19:05 that the Bible had to continue to be used
00:19:09 in Latin, that the priests, that religious people
00:19:13 had to explain the
00:19:16 meaning of the Bible to people,
00:19:19 while the Lutherans thought that they
00:19:23 did not.  that the bible should be translated
00:19:26 that any pe  rsona would have to be able to
00:19:29 read the bible and understand it themselves
00:19:33 have a more direct contact with god
00:19:37 not then the bible translated into
00:19:40 common language because it was prohibited
00:19:44 by the inquisition
00:19:46 then again the moriscos no the
00:19:49 moriscos had converted from
00:19:53 alcatel islam to catholicism i
00:19:56 think  Before I told you wrong,
00:19:58 in 1492 it was not only the Jews and
00:20:06 then in 1500 in 1502 in Castile and in
00:20:13 1526 later in Aragon
00:20:20 the Jews were forced to convert to Christianity
00:20:23 but then later in 1568 they began to
00:20:31 see problems  of violence against the
00:20:35 Moors against the
00:20:38 converted Muslims no and the inquisition
00:20:43 also began to judge many
00:20:47 Moriscos
00:20:49 what happens is that the number of death sentences
00:20:52 the percentage of Moriscos who were
00:20:57 burned to those who were killed was much
00:21:00 lower it was  much smaller than those of
00:21:03 the new christians than those of the
00:21:06 jews what about witches
00:21:10 witches were people mostly
00:21:13 women whom  They were accused of doing magic,
00:21:18 black magic, of using
00:21:22 supernatural powers, of making deals
00:21:25 with the devil in order to harm
00:21:29 other people
00:21:30 in general, the Spanish inquisition
00:21:35 considered it a superstition, they did not believe
00:21:40 that witches existed in
00:21:44 most cases due to witchcraft.  they were not
00:21:47 prosecuted they were not investigated in general
00:21:50 the majority yes there were some cases there were
00:21:54 very few cases
00:21:56 but there were some cases the largest case
00:21:59 was in navarra
00:22:03 in navarra yes six people were sentenced
00:22:06 again six people to the
00:22:10 stake to let them  they will be burned for witchcraft
00:22:13 it was not the largest case the others
00:22:17 were smaller and there were few
00:22:19 quite a few cases there were much fewer
00:22:23 cases than in france than in germany or
00:22:28 england not where there were more
00:22:31 cases of witchcraft in addition the
00:22:35 inquisition also tried many
00:22:38 christians  He judged old Christians to
00:22:42 Christian families of a lifetime
00:22:45 for also crimes against religion
00:22:48 so for being a Christian you will not be saved
00:22:52 You could also be denounced and you
00:22:55 could be tried a crime for which you
00:22:58 could be tried was only for saying
00:23:01 that having sex having sex
00:23:05 before marriage before
00:23:09 art that it was not bad that it was not a
00:23:11 bad thing or for saying that Mariah that  the
00:23:15 virgin mary that the mother of jesus who
00:23:18 was not a virgin who had been with a
00:23:21 man to get pregnant not because
00:23:24 of that they could also judge you that you
00:23:27 judge yourself it does not mean that you burn
00:23:29 at the stake most of the cases of the
00:23:33 inquisition were  prison sentences
00:23:36 were people who were sent to prison
00:23:39 in a society like this this time in
00:23:43 spain when
00:23:45 divorce was prohibited it
00:23:49 was forbidden it was forbidden to divorce you to separate
00:23:52 from your husband or your wife it was quite
00:23:55 common to have lovers to have another
00:23:59 man or another  another woman outside of your husband
00:24:03 or your wife, not then, if you were a
00:24:05 man and they discovered that you had a
00:24:10 mistress, they would send you to the galleys, they would
00:24:13 send you rowing for five to  years yes
00:24:17 yes five years they sent you to a ship a
00:24:20 large ship that was the galleys and they
00:24:24 made you row because the people who
00:24:26 rowed in the galleys were prisoners they were
00:24:29 convicted people if another crime was
00:24:34 having homosexual relations having sex
00:24:37 with a good person among men
00:24:41 Basically among men,
00:24:44 102 people were sentenced
00:24:49 for having sex between men. They were not
00:24:53 sentenced. They were executed. A total
00:24:56 of 102 people were burned for having homosexual sex.
00:24:59 In the entire
00:25:03 existence of the AIT of the Inquisition,
00:25:06 it is estimated that between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.
00:25:10 people between 3000 and 5000
00:25:15 people were burned alive
00:25:19 at the stake but many cases many
00:25:23 cases of the inquisition were
00:25:26 very small crimes no surely not the
00:25:30 people who were executed no but
00:25:33 many of the cases tried by the
00:25:36 inquisition were nonsense they were
00:25:40 very very small cases  For example, there were
00:25:43 complaints
00:25:45 about having a conversation
00:25:49 and someone  nciona I know the Virgin Mary
00:25:51 spoke of the Virgin Mary of the mother
00:25:54 of Jesus and that another person smiles I know you
00:25:58 you have smiled when I spoke of the
00:26:01 Virgin Mary I also denounce you a
00:26:05 complaint for having eaten onions and
00:26:08 having eaten pork in one day  a
00:26:12 day of the year in which religion said
00:26:15 that you should not eat pork
00:26:18 that you should not eat onion but this
00:26:21 person nobody saw him eating onion or
00:26:25 eating eating pork
00:26:28 but this person was French and someone
00:26:31 said you are French  in france there are
00:26:35 many heretics in france there are many
00:26:38 people who do not follow the religion well
00:26:42 then you surely ate pork and
00:26:46 onion the day it was
00:26:49 prohibited
00:26:50 and that's why they denounced a
00:26:53 person and this was very easy to do
00:26:57 because you could  report someone
00:27:00 anonymously you could report someone
00:27:04 without anyone knowing who was
00:27:07 reporting who was person
00:27:10 who was the person who had given the
00:27:13 information  no, and if it was proven that it
00:27:17 was not true, it was shown that that person
00:27:21 had not done anything wrong to the person
00:27:23 who had denounced or they were given a
00:27:26 very small sentence, a very small punishment
00:27:29 or there was not even any punishment
00:27:32 for the person who had lied  that he
00:27:35 had filed a false complaint then, of
00:27:37 course, this system was abused a
00:27:43 lot, many people abused it,
00:27:47 the inquisition was used to harm or
00:27:51 get rid of enemies,
00:27:55 personal enemies, political rivals, sometimes even
00:27:59 among former friends who had become
00:28:01 angry or among members  from the same
00:28:05 family who did not get along because they
00:28:07 denounced each other so the
00:28:10 inquisition had its own prisons there
00:28:14 were the prisons the prisons of
00:28:17 the official justice system
00:28:22 of the state justice system and there were other
00:28:25 prisons separate from the inquisition
00:28:28 then the inquisition could catch you  and
00:28:32 put you in jail I could put you
00:28:35 in jail without denouncing you without having
00:28:38 officially said  or that they accused you
00:28:41 without having tried you, they could put you
00:28:45 in jail without telling anyone where
00:28:48 you were, they didn't tell your family where
00:28:51 you were, nobody told you that they could come and
00:28:53 see, you couldn't talk to a lawyer and
00:28:56 well, there were also many
00:29:00 times  they tortured people they tortured
00:29:04 people were hurt to extract
00:29:07 confessions so that people
00:29:09 confessed although this seems to have been
00:29:13 normal at the time this was also done
00:29:16 even in the normal justice system
00:29:19 this was also done a lot in fact
00:29:23 in the inquisition the inquisition  He
00:29:27 did it less than the normal legal system,
00:29:32 not because they were good, because they were
00:29:35 good people, but really because they
00:29:39 had realized that with torture,
00:29:41 what he got was that people
00:29:44 lied, you got people to say
00:29:47 yes, yes, yes, I have been, it's my fault.
00:29:51 only because they didn't want to feel
00:29:55 pain they didn't want to be tortured it's not
00:29:58 then why the Spanish inquisition
00:30:01 has this bad image
00:30:05 well know  given internationally for
00:30:08 being very bad for being very cruel well
00:30:10 I'm sure this matters it doesn't really matter well
00:30:14 they burned many
00:30:16 people who especially treated
00:30:19 Jews or Jewish converts quite
00:30:23 badly although historians or many
00:30:26 historians consider that it has been
00:30:30 given  a really bad image because
00:30:33 there was a reason there was a
00:30:35 historical reason for other countries to
00:30:40 have a bad image of spain they
00:30:44 gave it a bad image because it was quite
00:30:46 their adversary it was their adversary due to
00:30:50 all the power all the strength that
00:30:53 spain had at that time  Also due to the
00:30:56 rivalry, the rivalry between
00:30:59 Protestants and between Catholics and well,
00:31:02 I don't know to what extent the bad image of
00:31:05 the
00:31:07 royal inquisition or is it an exaggeration, I'm not going
00:31:11 to get into it, perhaps to give my opinion there
00:31:14 because I don't know enough about the subject
00:31:18 to talk  of this or to give
00:31:21 an opinion to say with
00:31:24 certainty that it is true and that it is not true
00:31:26 but well that's it  So far the
00:31:30 end here the video on the
00:31:32 Spanish inquisition no what you did not
00:31:36 expect and I think we
00:31:38 expected it and well this is the last
00:31:42 video of this time of this part of
00:31:44 history in the next video we will

",3
185,"00:00:00 reading on the internet reading in forums
00:00:03 more than once I have found someone
00:00:07 who talks about their level in a
00:00:12 language has taken a leap that suddenly they have
00:00:16 improved a lot in a language and today I am going
00:00:20 to talk about this it is possible to give a  I jump
00:00:23 in level in a language or not if it's
00:00:27 possible how can you get it
00:00:32 [Music]
00:00:35 ah well
00:00:37 what do I think of this let's see I don't think in
00:00:42 general I don't think it's possible to make a
00:00:46 big jump quickly in the amount
00:00:50 of language you've acquired  that you know
00:00:54 no and it is very rare to have this feeling
00:01:00 of having improved a lot
00:01:03 of having improved a lot in a short time a
00:01:06 short time when x time is a
00:01:09 week one or two weeks no me whenever
00:01:12 I have learned a language the feeling
00:01:16 of improvement has been very progressive  very not
00:01:21 necessarily very slow I learned to
00:01:24 speak Japanese in a year about a year
00:01:29 after a year of starting I already spoke
00:01:31 Japanese quite well but even
00:01:35 then the progression was slow it was very
00:01:39 progressive it was little by little by little  or
00:01:43 then in which case there are exceptions or
00:01:47 in which cases it may seem to us that we have
00:01:50 improved a lot very quickly a case is
00:01:55 when we are starting when
00:01:58 we learn a language that is
00:02:01 related that is connected in some
00:02:05 way with a language that we already know
00:02:08 especially if they have
00:02:10 words  of the same origin if you speak
00:02:13 English and learn Spanish or especially
00:02:17 if you speak Portuguese or Italian or
00:02:19 French and learn Spanish there are many
00:02:24 words of the same origin words that
00:02:27 are spelled the same or almost the same
00:02:31 words that are pronounced in a
00:02:34 similar way and at first it does not seem so at first
00:02:38 At first it is difficult because in Spanish
00:02:41 the pronunciation is different the accent
00:02:45 is different so at first
00:02:48 you have to make this connection you have
00:02:52 to realize this letter in Spanish
00:02:56 is pronounced like this and when you
00:02:59 realize this you suddenly understand many more
00:03:03 words in Spanish this  Yes, it can
00:03:07 happen. When I started listening to
00:03:12 Portuguese podcasts, I realized that after
00:03:16 30 minutes  minutes or an hour I already understood much more I
00:03:20 understood many more things than at the
00:03:23 beginning just by understanding how it is
00:03:28 pronounced how the pronunciation changes
00:03:32 between Spanish and Portuguese not then
00:03:37 another situation in which we can make a
00:03:41 big leap in our level or it
00:03:44 can give us the impression  that we have taken
00:03:47 a big leap is by breaking
00:03:51 psychological barriers barriers that our
00:03:54 mind puts ideas that we ourselves have
00:03:57 perhaps we think that we do not know how to
00:04:01 speak the language well perhaps we are
00:04:04 ashamed if at some point we are
00:04:07 able to break this barrier of being
00:04:11 in a situation  very relaxed in which
00:04:14 we do not mind making mistakes
00:04:17 because we can realize that we can
00:04:21 speak better with more fluency, it is not
00:04:24 that we have suddenly learned many things,
00:04:27 it is not that we no longer have a barrier that
00:04:31 we had before, the lack of self-
00:04:34 confidence  or lack
00:04:39 or shame even when it comes to
00:04:43 understanding others if we are in a
00:04:47 more relaxed situation more  calm down
00:04:50 we can not worry about what we are going
00:04:53 to
00:04:55 say next and we can pay more
00:04:58 attention to what the other person is saying
00:05:01 and understand it better and all this
00:05:04 we have not learned much at once
00:05:07 our knowledge in our
00:05:09 brain has not suddenly taken a big leap
00:05:12 but our production the
00:05:16 result when we try to
00:05:19 speak has taken a big and good leap
00:05:22 just like in low stress
00:05:24 situations we can improve in stress situations
00:05:27 we can get worse again and it may be
00:05:30 that we notice this in some situations
00:05:33 I don't know it's easier to talk  that in
00:05:36 others then although I do not think
00:05:41 there is anything that can make us make a
00:05:44 big leap from one level to another level
00:05:48 of the language, I do believe that we can make
00:05:51 a big leap in the speed at which
00:05:54 we learn, we are not going to go from here
00:05:57 here instantly but we
00:06:01 can go
00:06:01 from learning at this speed to learning
00:06:05 at this speed the path will be
00:06:09 progressive but for every hour that
00:06:12 let's spend learning for each hour of
00:06:15 input we will be improving more not
00:06:18 then to start this leap in
00:06:22 learning speed
00:06:25 the first thing is of course to learn with
00:06:28 comprehensible input learn with
00:06:31 content like this content at your
00:06:34 level content that you understand well
00:06:38 content in which you receive  a lot of input
00:06:42 in Spanish in which you listen to or read a
00:06:45 lot of Spanish and I have received a
00:06:49 lot of comments about this
00:06:51 many users many students of
00:06:54 dream in spanish have told me that in a
00:06:57 few months of receiving input from dreaming
00:07:01 spanish they have improved much faster
00:07:04 than they had in years  trying
00:07:08 in Spanish and in a few months the dream in
00:07:12 Spanish have learned much faster
00:07:15 Another important jump in the speed of
00:07:19 learning is if at some point you
00:07:24 realize that you were listening to or
00:07:27 reading things that were a bit
00:07:30 difficult and you try to read or  to
00:07:33 listen to easier things and this
00:07:37 happened to me with Japanese for a
00:07:40 long time this  I was reading novels
00:07:43 novels for adults that
00:07:47 I did understand I understood the story but it was still hard for me it was
00:07:51 still a bit hard for me I was a bit
00:07:54 tired of reading I didn't read very fast and it
00:07:57 makes reading things easier I
00:08:02 started reading children's stories stories from
00:08:06 picture books  very
00:08:10 simple stories where there were
00:08:13 one
00:08:14 or two sentences on one page and I was surprised at how
00:08:18 many new words I learned
00:08:21 I learned a lot of new words very
00:08:24 quickly because the context was so clear
00:08:28 the pictures and the story made the
00:08:32 new words very easy to understand
00:08:35 easily
00:08:37 then another way to make a jump in
00:08:40 the speed at which you learn is to
00:08:43 try to listen or read easier content
00:08:47 even if it seems too easy
00:08:51 because then you understand almost everything
00:08:55 still from time to time there will be
00:08:58 new words that you do not know yet and another
00:09:01 jump  Another very big jump in
00:09:04 speed is when you find something
00:09:08 you really like, find videos,
00:09:13 a book or a podcast or a  series that you
00:09:18 like a lot you like it so much that when you
00:09:21 watch or read it you forget that it
00:09:25 is in Spanish you forget that
00:09:27 you are listening to or reading
00:09:30 Spanish why is it so funny and
00:09:33 when you find something like that something that you
00:09:36 like so much you can pass it on  hours and
00:09:40 hours and hours doing it and the speed
00:09:43 at which you are going to learn will
00:09:45 also be much faster
00:09:47 so to conclude
00:09:51 today's conclusions is that language learning
00:09:57 is unfortunately progressive it will
00:10:00 be little by little
00:10:02 you will learn little  little by little you are
00:10:05 going to feel that it is all very progressive
00:10:09 you are going to learn words each word
00:10:12 you are going to learn little by little little by
00:10:15 little each word do not expect at any
00:10:18 time to make a big leap in
00:10:21 understanding in a day or a week  If
00:10:25 you want to see progress, notice that you are
00:10:28 improving, try to listen for at least
00:10:32 an hour a day,
00:10:34 I think that an hour a day or more is a good
00:10:37 idea because you are going to notice very easily
00:10:40 that  you are improving and that is going to improve
00:10:44 your motivation it is
00:10:46 going to give you more motivation so one
00:10:50 hour a day as I have told you to listen and
00:10:53 read things that are very easy
00:10:57 and listen and read things that you like
00:11:00 that are very fun and if you are
00:11:03 doing this then  each day you are going to
00:11:07 know a little more than the day before and
00:11:11 if you continue doing this if you continue each
00:11:13 day you continue learning something that you did not
00:11:16 know the day before it
00:11:18 is inevitable you will reach the point
00:11:22 where you will already know how to communicate everything you
00:11:26 need to have a conversation
00:11:28 to have a day-to-day conversation
00:11:31 to meet people to talk to
00:11:34 Spanish-speaking people and well tell me
00:11:37 your stories too
00:11:39 tell me if at any time you have
00:11:42 noticed a jump in your level or if
00:11:46 you have ever noticed a change in the
00:11:49 speed at which you are  learning
00:11:52 you can share your experiences
00:11:54 below in the comments,
00:11:57 okay and if you doubt what level you are at, you
00:12:03 want to know what level of Spanish
00:12:06 you have to  You will know what you have to
00:12:10 do at your level to reach the
00:12:14 next level. You want to see when I
00:12:18 am at the next level that I will know
00:12:21 how to do what I will be able to do with Spanish. What
00:12:24 do I know?
