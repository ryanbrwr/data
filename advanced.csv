00:00:05 hi guys one more time your mexicana here
00:00:08 talking to you how are you
00:00:11 guys
00:00:15 today today i want to tell you a
00:00:18 pretty tragic story quite difficult
00:00:23 thanks to the universe i'm still alive i'm fine
00:00:26 your mexicana is here she hasn't died yet someday i
00:00:31 'm going to  die but I'm still alive
00:00:34 guys no no no no no today I'm going to
00:00:36 tell you about the story that story
00:00:39 where Andrew ate Mexican style badly badly
00:00:43 in the wrong way cheese
00:00:48 blessed cheese beautiful
00:00:51 you know if you don't know I'm a fan
00:00:53 of cheese I love cheese  cheese and
00:00:56 I always want that in my fridge
00:00:59 whatever, for example, although
00:01:02 that happens I'm not a big fan but I really like
00:01:05 cheese and having my fridge
00:01:07 I went to the supermarket about two
00:01:10 weeks ago and I was there I was looking at the
00:01:13 types of cheese that  There were now in Mexico
00:01:16 the types of cheese that there are very
00:01:20 different and we also have many
00:01:23 cheeses that are Mexican that I miss a
00:01:25 lot because here in Canada
00:01:28 we have cheeses but
00:01:30 They are not
00:01:32 very commercial and then I
00:01:35 heard a guy who was from Europe
00:01:40 I think he lived. He was a European who was
00:01:42 talking to a Canadian lady from Canada
00:01:45 and they were talking about the
00:01:48 types of cheese because he was
00:01:51 explaining the guy from Europe to this
00:01:55 Ma'am, well, the difference between the
00:01:58 cheeses and that it is a good cheese and that it is not
00:02:01 a good cheese and I was just
00:02:04 listening to the conversation, right to know
00:02:07 a little more about the cheeses, he began to
00:02:09 say that the cheeses were very
00:02:11 industrialized, very commercial, very
00:02:14 false, they are  cheeses but they are not that good
00:02:17 or of good quality and he began to tell
00:02:20 her that those were of good quality that they
00:02:22 sold in the store and one of the cheeses
00:02:24 that they sold in the store was a
00:02:27 gouda cheese that I bought, I am going to show it to you
00:02:30 now  I almost finished it sorry
00:02:34 this was a cheese of this size if what
00:02:36 is left is this a gouda cheese
00:02:39 that I bought it has 940 grams
00:02:45 I have almost finished it but I didn't want to finish it I
00:02:47 said I'm not going to  finish because
00:02:49 I want to show the kids what
00:02:52 happened I bought this cheese I was very happy
00:02:55 this cheese cost me 15 dollars more or
00:02:59 less game it's for a good cheese if
00:03:02 it's good well it was good I bought it
00:03:05 because sometimes I get really tired of the taste
00:03:08 of cheese  mozzarella cheese or a more
00:03:11 commercial cheese that is cheaper but I get
00:03:14 very tired of the flavor I don't like
00:03:17 strong strong cheeses
00:03:19 so good the gouda was good buy
00:03:22 the one that only with me I said what a delicious
00:03:25 cheese it was very good it's a cheese  that it
00:03:28 has had a longer aging time,
00:03:32 that is, it has taken longer for
00:03:35 cheeses like these to go on the market that this
00:03:38 is a more commercial mozzarella cheese,
00:03:40 these are very easy
00:03:43 to make quickly and it is good
00:03:47 but it is not the best in cheeses.  I know I
00:03:52 know so I bought this cheese
00:03:55 Gouda cheese and I saw that it had this red and I said
00:03:59 oh look how interesting the cheese is red it
00:04:02 's red no and well the joke is
00:04:06 that I started to split the cheese and started
00:04:09 to eat  the cheese
00:04:12 I think and the texture the sensation
00:04:15 was quite different for everything I
00:04:20 'm not going to show you what I did I
00:04:23 still can't believe it guys I ate
00:04:27 the cheese here it is and I split the cheese
00:04:31 I ate the cheese I ate it all
00:04:36 When I eat this red part
00:04:39 I realize that it feels different, it's not
00:04:43 like the texture of the cheese feels
00:04:46 different, but I say well, maybe it's
00:04:48 because it's the old part of the cheese and
00:04:51 that's why they painted it or something and I ate it
00:04:54 guys.  I'm going to swear I swear that
00:04:59 when I ate half the cheese, that is,
00:05:01 I had eaten half of this giant cheese
00:05:07 and the great idea of ​​grabbing the
00:05:10 red part of the cheese occurred to me, that is,
00:05:15 I did take the red part
00:05:18 and ate only the  red part guys
00:05:23 guys
00:05:26 like a plastic with
00:05:29 plastic I thought this was part of the
00:05:33 cheese but this is plastic guys it's
00:05:36 not even plastic you know a candle when
00:05:39 you learn a candle like that so you can
00:05:42 use it or in churches that light candles
00:05:46 or if you have  if you have a roman dinner  Tica,
00:05:48 light candles, well, this is wax, this
00:05:53 is literally not
00:05:56 cheese, I was eating this with the
00:05:58 cheese, now I understand why I couldn't
00:06:01 go to the bathroom because it was hard for me
00:06:06 guys I'm dying I'm dying
00:06:09 then I learned that I can't eat
00:06:12 the part  red I have to eat only the
00:06:14 cheese and the red part I have removed it
00:06:20 see this I ate this
00:06:25 this without that this is what if I can
00:06:27 eat this is what I can't eat
00:06:29 then it's not that I didn't die the good thing is
00:06:32 that  I'm alive to tell this story
00:06:34 but it was very traumatic to see that according to me I
00:06:37 loved cheese and everything but I love to eat
00:06:41 that doesn't mean I know much about
00:06:44 cheese ok I just learned that
00:06:49 you can't eat this red thing you just eat cheese
00:06:52 so guys you guys
00:06:54 Be very careful when you eat cheese, let's take
00:06:57 a bite, it's cheese, I've already
00:06:58 craved it, you too,
00:07:02 and
00:07:03 [Music]
00:07:05 the cheese, and now I was saving
00:07:10 this cheese because I had to show you
00:07:13 my tragedy, my story.  Now that
00:07:16 I've recorded this video I can eat this
00:07:18 cheese and cheese is tasty guys,

00:07:28 hardest thing will be to stop eating cheese
00:07:30 because cheese is life, cheese  It is in
00:07:33 many Mexican dishes that I

04,"00:09:09 [Music] Hi, I'm Marx and Carvajalino Carvajalino and well, today I want to talk about what I think about drug series that have been very popular for a while now and I want to talk about series versus reality, not me personally.  I like them because I feel that they show a violent Colombia to a Colombia that was yes but about 25 years ago in the time of Pablo Escobar and they are series that are really focused on drug trafficking as if we were really like that and I want to say no friends Colombia  It is not like that, currently it does not have that degree or level of drug trafficking or violence, obviously if in some parts there is drug trafficking, this thing of drugs or kidnappings, but not in the amount shown in the series and they are in certain parts, let's say, of high risk in Colombia.  like the jungle it is not that you will arrive because many foreign people tell me it is that it scares me because I think that I am going to arrive at the airport and it has trees and  jungle and as soon as I got there they are going to kidnap me no it's not like that I mean no that doesn't happen and it's not that you go walking and they kidnap you or they do something to you and you go down the street and they're selling you cocaine or marijuana it's not like that then I feel that the  The series show a lot of that, well, starting with the fact that in general almost all the series the characters are paisas, the paisas are those from the Antioquia region who speak a little cantadito cantadito is the most pronounced accent that I speak, well, how is it, how has it gone, is that  I am a paisa, you can, so from the beginning, the people already agree that we Colombians speak there, so from the beginning they tell you Colombians, then they start with the tone and to imitate this way, it is not like that, not all of us speak like that  I'm from Bogota, from the capital, well, he wanted me in Bogotá and we don't talk like that all the time. First, that's something that needs to be removed.  The cia that Colombia is currently showing is not like that. I come back and explained that what you can see was a time when violence and drug trafficking was very strong, all this about kidnappings, vaccines, vaccines, they were told when the guerrillas, the FARC, and they go  They asked the towns and peasants for money, they asked the people of the towns for money so that nothing would happen to them, which was a way of taking care of them and then they were called a vaccine to go town by town with the people and to the shops and businesses  and they all asked for a vaccine so that nothing would happen to them and they would be protected by the guerrillas there was also something called 'false positives' and it was that the army grabbed peasants and people from the town and said that they were guerrillas for something I don't know about looking good  or because they asked them to go and finish off the guerrillas so they would arrive and seize innocent people and they were called 'false positives' yes it did happen yes it was a very bad time  death in violence but that at that time was already 25 or 30 years ago when pablo escobar was around i feel that what the series do is that they even motivate people for example when the pablo escobar series came out and it showed him a bit like a hero  and people said no, but I'm going to see how Pablo Escobar is, if he doesn't pay attention to me I'm going to give him lead and they began to say many things that were said in the series and also the television showed him a bit like not a hero  But as a being with whom people identified, he did do things for the vulnerable and underprivileged community in Medellín, but he was not a hero, he really did many things that affected many families, many people, many kidnappings, well, an endless number of extortions and they are  many things and he was not a hero and television puts him as a person with whom you can identify with feelings who fights for a good cause and justifying his actions a bit and I say no  And then when I listen to foreigners who don't know the story very well, perhaps of Pablo Escobar and how things were, instead of investigating, they get carried away by television and series and all this and then they begin to believe in what they see.  that it is between fiction and reality and they begin to get carried away by this and they begin to identify with these characters and they do not begin to see the bad in all this topic and it happened to me with several friends that is why I say it because they began to talk to me and  It's that I'm going to do like Pablo Escobar and I'm going to start talking to you, so yes, and the phrases that I used to say, no, read a little more about history from 30 years ago, really see the context and what happened so that  so that you coherently and intelligently give a concept of what drug trafficking was and you don't see it as something to admire and it's very difficult to get people out of a Colombian cliché thanks to this type of series and that they currently show us then in  I personally don't like it, I think it seems very violent and things are shown that are not really happening, other than if they perhaps did happen or did happen at the time, but I feel that they expand it and make it bigger than it is and people  They keep that concept of what Colombia is in their heads with what they see, but they don't take the time to investigate a little more about history and make their own conclusions. I don't know, that's my opinion and it's good if they have the opportunity to read.  a bit of the history of colombia its evolution is also important about what is happening today it is very cool like everything there is danger in many places but don't believe me you are not going to get to the airport and i am going to kidnap you or you are going to  a jungle and you're going to climb a mountain no so don't worry if one day you want to go to colombia and see with confidence that things have changed and there has been an evolution for the better then well that's all for today and well if you watch series watch enjoy them  he  If you like it, it's fine, but do
00:09:12 n't stick with it or don't stay with what you see, a
00:09:16 dress that's a little better is bye

05,"00:00:00 well today we are here
00:00:05 today we are here in a bar in a
00:00:09 real japanese bar yes yes yes no no no
00:00:12 we are not in the youtube space yet
00:00:16 but oysters this is very very cool very
00:00:19 interesting and I am going to talk about Japan
00:00:23 I am going to talk about  the first time i
00:00:27 went to japan and what things surprised me they
00:00:32 surprised me a lot about japan
00:00:37 [Music]
00:00:39 oh well
00:00:42 yes this looks like a bar but
00:00:47 we're really good and we're in
00:00:49 japan we're in tokyo but it's
00:00:52 youtube space which is a studio it's
00:00:56 There is no fake here there is no alcohol
00:01:00 the dishes are real the
00:01:03 dishes are real but hey this is a
00:01:06 studio it is for recording to record
00:01:08 videos but hey today we are going to talk about
00:01:12 what things surprised me when I went to
00:01:15 Japan when I went to  to live in japan i went
00:01:19 in 2010 i
00:01:21 went in 2010 and i was in japan for about
00:01:24 four years almost four years and at the
00:01:27 beginning when i went i had never
00:01:30 traveled to japan so there were things that
00:01:34 surprised me they surprised me a
00:01:36 lot no
00:01:38 and today i am going to explain  r some of those
00:01:41 things the first the first thing that
00:01:45 surprised me is how homogeneous Japan is
00:01:49 homogeneous, it means that it is the same that it
00:01:53 is all very similar,
00:01:55 it is not that Japan is very similar
00:01:59 visually, nature or the cities
00:02:03 that well a bit also a bit  but
00:02:06 there are some things that are very similar
00:02:09 that surprised me, for example,
00:02:13 vacuum cleaners, do you know what a vacuum
00:02:24 cleaner is?
00:02:27 to power you press a button and you can
00:02:29 vacuum
00:02:32 you can vacuum you can clean the house
00:02:36 in japan vacuum cleaners always
00:02:40 have buttons on the handle they have a button
00:02:42 when you pick up the vacuum cleaner to vacuum they
00:02:45 have the button here where you pick it up
00:02:48 where your hand is they don't have the button  in
00:02:51 the machine in the vacuum cleaner in spain
00:02:54 normally many have it in the
00:02:57 vacuum cleaner so that you step on it with your foot
00:03:00 no but hey there are differences
00:03:03 There are different types but in Japan, not in
00:03:06 Japan, they are always like this. They always have the
00:03:09 button here on the handle. They
00:03:12 also have a pot to boil water. They
00:03:16 have a good
00:03:22 pot in
00:03:25 many countries.  They have it to make
00:03:26 hot tea, it's a pot that
00:03:28 plugs into the mains, you press a button
00:03:31 and it heats the water, but the ones in
00:03:35 Europe, for example, there are different
00:03:37 types, there are buttons on the handle,
00:03:39 there are levers on the bottom, here they
00:03:42 are.  a lever there are different types
00:03:44 but in japan not in japan they are all more
00:03:47 or less the same they all have the button
00:03:50 on the handle another example are
00:03:54 taxis taxis in japan are all the same
00:03:58 model they are the same car model they are
00:04:01 all the same and  For example, everyone has a
00:04:05 motorized door. The
00:04:08 taxi driver can press a button and open the
00:04:11 door. Open the door for you to
00:04:13 get into the taxi. Everyone has it.
00:04:17 They have it the same and if that is one
00:04:20 thing that I thought is different in
00:04:22 Japan, in Spain there is perhaps more
00:04:25 variety, there are more things, because they are
00:04:27 different,
00:04:29 and in Japan many times when they
00:04:30 find a well-
00:04:33 done way to do something, well, they always do it.
00:04:35 they do the same, everyone does it the
00:04:37 same way
00:04:39 another thing that surprised me in japan is
00:04:42 the shape of my head
00:04:46 if you will say why in japan your head
00:04:49 has to do if when i went to japan it was
00:04:54 the first time in my life that someone
00:04:57 He said that I have a
00:04:59 pretty head shape which is that it's pretty
00:05:02 I have a pretty shape and I've never
00:05:05 thought about it I've never thought that
00:05:08 different people
00:05:11 have different head shapes they have a
00:05:13 different head and in Japan so good  In
00:05:18 Asia, yes, there are people who have a
00:05:20 less round behind and for
00:05:25 them they believe that having a
00:05:28 round head shape is more, it's more
00:05:30 beautiful,
00:05:31 no, I've never thought
00:05:34 about it.  The shape of people's heads
00:05:36 Another thing that surprised me about Japan is
00:05:40 that I
00:05:42 often hit my head because I often hit my face
00:05:45 because many times the ceilings are
00:05:48 low or there are things that are low: the
00:05:53 doors, the door frames  They are
00:05:55 low and I hit myself on the
00:05:59 head that happens to me here it happens to me in japan
00:06:02 but it also happens to me in thailand in
00:06:04 thailand it also happens and here in
00:06:07 japan it even happened to me in my house where
00:06:11 i lived the doors the frames the
00:06:13 frames of  the doors were they were short
00:06:18 and many times it hit me and it
00:06:21 hurts it hurts a lot
00:06:25 another thing that surprised me in japan is
00:06:29 a phenomenon a phenomenon that in
00:06:32 japanese is called uric and that is that it is
00:06:37 legal it is when a person many
00:06:41 times girls  many times it is girls
00:06:43 who do it when a person
00:06:46 pretends to imitate a child a little imitates
00:06:50 being childish being younger with the
00:06:54 way they move because of the way they
00:06:56 act but also with the beauty  e with the
00:06:59 voice
00:07:00 many times speaking with a higher
00:07:02 voice than his real voice speaking like this a
00:07:05 bit like a child well yes yes
00:07:08 speaking in this way and I have met
00:07:11 a few girls who speak in this
00:07:14 way or who spoke in this way  and it
00:07:16 is something that surprised me is that that
00:07:20 is not your voice you are speaking with another voice
00:07:23 no and it is something that
00:07:25 surprised me a lot but
00:07:28 I also heard an interview with some
00:07:32 girls some very intelligent girls who
00:07:35 had gone to a good university
00:07:37 had graduated  from a good university
00:07:39 and had a good job
00:07:43 and these girls said that when they
00:07:45 met boys when they went to a
00:07:47 party and met boys and told them
00:07:50 where they had studied and that they
00:07:52 worked the boys didn't like
00:07:55 the boys they lost interest in the boys
00:07:58 they no longer wanted to talk to them and
00:08:00 so pretending to be less smart
00:08:04 pretending to be dumber and not
00:08:07 telling them what university they had
00:08:09 studied at because it seems that the boys
00:08:12 were still interested  You are interested in them
00:08:16 and well, it is something that shocks
00:08:19 me quite a bit. I was quite surprised. Another
00:08:21 thing that surprised me a lot is the
00:08:25 makeup, the makeup, but it is the
00:08:28 fact that there are girls who never leave the
00:08:34 house without applying makeup, they never go out without
00:08:37 applying makeup on their faces.  they let
00:08:41 other people see them without makeup
00:08:45 and there are even boyfriends who have never
00:08:50 seen their girlfriend without makeup they have never
00:08:53 seen her natural i don't even even know
00:08:58 of a story about a girl who went
00:09:02 to bed went to bed with her  I don't know if
00:09:05 with her boyfriend and her husband they would go to
00:09:07 sleep and after going to sleep she
00:09:10 would get up she would go to the bathroom she would clean herself she
00:09:13 would clean her face then she would go to
00:09:16 sleep and in the morning before her
00:09:19 husband got up she would get up
00:09:23 She was going to put on makeup, she put makeup on all of them, and
00:09:26 then she went back to bed, she went back to
00:09:29 bed with her husband, and
00:09:32 I was surprised that surprised me a lot. It's
00:09:34 very, very extreme. It's something very extreme.
00:09:42 or well-intentioned that people are the
00:09:46 good intentions that many
00:09:49 people have or that seem to have very, very good
00:09:52 intentions be very, very good because
00:09:55 because it gave me this impression because
00:09:57 I thought this whenever something strange happened
00:10:01 whenever someone or a friend
00:10:04 acted in a certain way  that I didn't understand or
00:10:07 that it seemed to me a bad way or that he
00:10:11 did something that I didn't like when I
00:10:14 talked to other people
00:10:16 I talked to other friends I told
00:10:19 other friends many times the answer
00:10:23 was trying to understand that person
00:10:26 trying maybe to explain why  Well, that
00:10:29 person had done that by seeing the
00:10:32 positive part of
00:10:34 the way that person was or
00:10:37 explaining the problems as a
00:10:40 problem of not understanding or
00:10:44 being different, but without saying that there is
00:10:47 a person who is bad or a person has
00:10:50 done something  bad, no, and understanding the
00:10:53 problems, the problems that exist, well,
00:10:56 perhaps with a lack of compatibility or
00:11:00 saying that person, well, is not
00:11:03 just a bad person  that maybe when talking when
00:11:07 saying things well he doesn't have much tact he doesn't
00:11:10 go very carefully not things like that but
00:11:13 another interesting thing that I saw is
00:11:17 that sometimes people explode sometimes
00:11:21 people can't stand it they can't well
00:11:26 their patience is running out  Japanese
00:11:30 often try to be patient,
00:11:32 be patient if something happens that they don't
00:11:35 like or there is a problem, try to
00:11:39 stay calm, no, but of course, keep
00:11:43 calm, always trying to stay
00:11:45 calm, because
00:11:48 stress often accumulates, accumulates, accumulates,
00:11:51 until until  that explodes no and I
00:11:55 saw it very well several times several times
00:11:58 I saw people I knew friends of mine who
00:12:02 I thought were very kind
00:12:05 people they were very very good people very kind people and
00:12:08 one day I saw them explode and start
00:12:12 shouting and start insulting  people and
00:12:15 I was surprised I was very surprised because he
00:12:18 seemed like a different
00:12:21 person a completely different person no and
00:12:23 this is another thing that surprised me and
00:12:26 well the last one  thing the last thing that
00:12:29 surprised me that I'm going to
00:12:31 talk about today is how innocent is a lot of
00:12:35 people I think that a lot of people in Japan are
00:12:38 quite innocent innocent what does
00:12:41 innocent mean innocent
00:12:45 maybe they don't understand or don't know
00:12:48 about issues well adult issues  issues of
00:12:52 adult people, both of being bad
00:12:55 people and sexual issues or
00:12:59 violence, things generally considered
00:13:02 as adults, not adults,
00:13:07 and an example is that the Japanese
00:13:10 understand the relationship between a man and
00:13:13 a woman, between a boy and a girl,
00:13:15 as  that follows a series of steps a
00:13:18 series of
00:13:20 at different stages different levels
00:13:22 that you have to follow and the first is
00:13:26 to shake hands shake hands a boy and
00:13:28 a girl or a couple
00:13:31 first shake hands then you have to
00:13:35 say that you like you I like you
00:13:37 I like you too yes and only
00:13:41 after that you can kiss you
00:13:44 can kiss you it's always like that no it's not
00:13:48 always like that it's not always the same but
00:13:50 this is the idea that  What many
00:13:52 people have that many people have is that
00:13:55 this is how it works well love is not
00:13:57 another example
00:13:59 of how innocent they are is that I
00:14:03 remember when I lived in Japan a
00:14:07 friend showed me a video clip a
00:14:09 video clip they make videos for
00:14:13 songs when  there is a song a
00:14:15 very popular song a famous song
00:14:17 many times a video clip is published which
00:14:20 is a video in which the singer appears
00:14:23 singing or different things appear something
00:14:26 interesting to watch while listening to
00:14:29 the song no then it is a video clip
00:14:32 of a Japanese pop group  of a group
00:14:35 of girls and in this video clip the girls
00:14:38 came out in their underwear they came out in a
00:14:41 bra and panties all very very
00:14:45 sexy very sensual no but my friend said
00:14:50 to this how cute look how cute how cute
00:14:54 but no I would say something cute well it is  a
00:14:58 boy or maybe it's a nice dress but
00:15:01 not girls in bras and panties no
00:15:06 this is more erotic it's something more sexual
00:15:08 it's not something cute and well that also
00:15:12 seemed to me that they were  innocent for calling
00:15:16 that cute when it would be something very, very
00:15:19 erotic, very clearly done, well, not
00:15:23 to interest men in an erotic way,
00:15:25 and well, that's it, this is the
00:15:29 list of things that surprised me
00:15:32 when I went to Japan, I think there are more,
00:15:34 there are many  more, but I already
00:15:37 forgot many things and many things, although at
00:15:40 first they surprised me, I was already
00:15:44 in Japan, I already knew that it was a
00:15:47 new culture and that there would be things that would not be
00:15:50 normal for me, but most
00:15:54 things I simply accepted
00:15:57 when I saw them, I thought.  For a moment,
00:16:00 I thought, look, that's new, but
00:16:04 then I immediately forgot, I think that for
00:16:06 most things that happened to me,
00:16:08 and well, I hope you liked this

00:00:05 to the soul hello today we are going to have a debate
00:00:12 and it has been a long time since we had a
00:00:15 debate and if yes today we are going to have a
00:00:17 debate we are going to see who is
00:00:19 right
00:00:21 we are going to see well maybe this has
00:00:25 to be decided by the  public and that
00:00:30 please look at this debate and leave a
00:00:33 comment below saying it is not
00:00:36 who you are in favor of who you think
00:00:38 is right and that we are going to discuss you
00:00:40 today at sea well
00:00:42 we are going to talk we are going to debate the
00:00:46 issue of taxes to  sugary drinks
00:00:48 yes it is a topic that in
00:00:51 recent years
00:00:53 has begun to appear in many countries
00:00:56 I think that in the usa I was talking and in
00:00:59 spain now it exists right now it exists
00:01:01 taxes on sugary drinks were raised
00:01:04 on soft drinks and other
00:01:06 drinks with added sugar no  yes yes yes and
00:01:11 soul returns and I do not
00:01:13 agree on this no
00:01:16 no I think not Pablo because it
00:01:20 seems good to you it seems a
00:01:23 positive measure what the tax puts is to
00:01:27 increase taxes on these drinks
00:01:30 no c  I think so and in general I believe my
00:01:34 more general point of view is that it is a
00:01:36 good idea to have this type of tax
00:01:38 to
00:01:43 discourage habits
00:01:47 that are bad for health or that are
00:01:49 bad for him in general.  the
00:01:51 well-being of the population of a country and
00:01:53 encourage, perhaps with
00:01:55 tax cuts or other measures,
00:01:58 behaviors or habits that are good,
00:02:00 well, also for the health or for the
00:02:02 general well-being of the country, not
00:02:05 you, what do you think?
00:02:07 Well, I don't like this  type of
00:02:11 measures because I think that each person
00:02:15 should be free to decide what is
00:02:18 good and what is bad in their life
00:02:22 so
00:02:24 well each person has the right not
00:02:28 to consume what they think is
00:02:32 something very subjective to say that
00:02:35 something  is it good or something is bad yes and
00:02:39 that's why it doesn't seem right to me because it seems
00:02:43 to me that it's something a bit it seems to me
00:02:45 a bit of an arbitrary measure because putting a
00:02:48 tax on sugary drinks
00:02:50 because precisely sugary drinks
00:02:52 radas and not any other type of
00:02:56 food is worth it so for you the
00:02:59 problem is that it is sugary drinks
00:03:01 and that you agree, for
00:03:03 example, that there is the same type of
00:03:05 tax on alcohol and tobacco,
00:03:08 that seems good to you, not to me  It seems
00:03:12 to me that then everything is
00:03:16 food or any product should
00:03:19 have lower taxes and that is
00:03:23 the person who decides how to live
00:03:26 how to live your how to live your life what
00:03:30 things are healthy and what things are not
00:03:32 because then really I  I can
00:03:36 decide if smoking tobacco is healthy for me.
00:03:39 Well, I believe that you can decide
00:03:43 how to have a healthy life and that is
00:03:46 different for each person, even though
00:03:49 objectively there are studies of things that
00:03:52 have a clear benefit on health
00:03:55 and there is the thing that has  In fact, we have
00:03:56 objective studies on the subject that are not
00:03:58 clear, but really,
00:04:02 the fact that, for example,
00:04:06 at a given moment a person drinks
00:04:10 a Coke does not mean that your life is
00:04:14 going to be less healthy than when  or a
00:04:18 person does not see any coca-cola yes or
00:04:22 the fact that you put taxes
00:04:24 on a product does not have an effect
00:04:27 on the health of people
00:04:33 with a tax the price of the
00:04:35 product goes up right
00:04:37 and a product that is more expensive is bought
00:04:40 less  people
00:04:42 if good is if a price
00:04:45 and if a person does less less
00:04:50 frequently
00:04:51 a habit that over time
00:04:55 repeatedly ends up being a
00:04:57 problem for their health because they will have on
00:05:00 average the population will have fewer
00:05:02 health problems yes or no good but you
00:05:06 We are taking for granted that this
00:05:08 person has a habit, which is the habit
00:05:11 of drinking sugary drinks.
00:05:13 I am going to start thinking that if it is
00:05:16 something that you do very often, it
00:05:19 will cost you a lot because if you buy and
00:05:21 drink three cokes with the  every day the
00:05:24 tax is something important it will be an
00:05:26 important expense in your life that can
00:05:28 make you reduce the amount you
00:05:31 consume because it will cost you more
00:05:33 money if you drink one with granola per
00:05:36 week  It is not clear that it will not be something
00:05:39 important that will cause your health to deteriorate,
00:05:41 but proportionally, this
00:05:45 tax will not be an important expense either,
00:05:46 because you only buy
00:05:48 one a week,
00:05:50 yes,
00:05:52 but then
00:05:54 in the case that, for example, a
00:05:57 person like that  to consume more
00:06:00 and this tax what you want to
00:06:03 discourage the person a little because it will
00:06:06 be very expensive what is not
00:06:10 really being considered is that other
00:06:14 types of products or other types of
00:06:17 habits the person is going to develop  and it is
00:06:20 going to replace that habit
00:06:24 with another it is not going to say good well I
00:06:26 don't consume this but I'm going to find an
00:06:30 alternative I'm going to find something else to
00:06:33 consume something else to do so
00:06:36 that's what I don't see I think that at
00:06:38 In the end, what do you do? You would have to put a
00:06:42 tax on anything, not
00:06:44 anything, that could be minimally
00:06:47 harmful so that a person does not
00:06:50 develop a habit.
00:06:53 I think that what you are commenting on is an
00:06:55 issue that  It makes sense that it is
00:06:58 interesting to discuss because it is true
00:07:01 that
00:07:02 when you make it very difficult, it is more difficult to
00:07:05 frequently drink sugary drinks
00:07:08 if people are going to replace that
00:07:11 unhealthy habit with another unhealthy habit,
00:07:14 it would not be interesting and
00:07:17 I think that a law like this one that
00:07:20 increases  The price of sugary drinks
00:07:23 should have in its objectives to
00:07:27 measure whether this law has really had a
00:07:30 positive impact or not to measure. I don't know.
00:07:32 Let's look in five years to see if
00:07:35 the obesity rate in Spain has dropped, for
00:07:37 example, and yes or yes.
00:07:42 life expectancy has even decreased because in the end
00:07:45 the rate of obesity may drop but
00:07:47 as you say some people well
00:07:48 maybe until now
00:07:52 to distract themselves from their life or stress
00:07:56 or whatever they drank sugary drinks
00:07:58 maybe now they will start smoking or something
00:08:01 not like this and you have to measure to see in
00:08:03 a general way perhaps the
00:08:06 life expectancy of people and yes I think it would be
00:08:09 interesting
00:08:10 that I thought that if we measure it is  or and it turns out
00:08:14 that it has had a positive effect
00:08:15 then the law would be justified or
00:08:19 not yet
00:08:21 no no I think not because in
00:08:25 the end let's see
00:08:29 if we start like this if you say I'm going to
00:08:34 prevent people from consuming a
00:08:38 good product I come first what  people
00:08:40 consume well yes yes yes yes it's true
00:08:42 well I'm going to try to hinder
00:08:46 or make it difficult to make
00:08:51 access to a certain product difficult
00:08:54 for people to
00:08:55 be healthier in quotes I
00:09:00 think the door is opened for people to
00:09:03 they start to
00:09:05 prohibit or start to hinder
00:09:09 access to many other products
00:09:12 and that it can be something very arbitrary
00:09:15 so we can't say well, let's
00:09:18 see if five years from now
00:09:21 the health of society has changed, I don't know, and
00:09:26 this is also very  difficult to measure because
00:09:29 it is not only there are many factors that
00:09:33 can intervene in it cannot be done
00:09:35 I create an experiment on such a large scale
00:09:37 no although I don't I don't know I'm not a
00:09:40 scientist nor but
00:09:43 but I think that then  Could the
00:09:47 governments start saying, well,
00:09:50 now we are going to hinder access to such a
00:09:53 product or service and thus begin to
00:09:57 limit the freedoms of each person.
00:10:00 I think that it is not the role
00:10:05 of the government to decide how you have to
00:10:08 live your life if  you have to be
00:10:10 healthy or not you must decide about your life
00:10:13 how you want to live it because everyone
00:10:16 has a standard, no you have your
00:10:19 standard of what a healthy life is,
00:10:21 paul and another person can see your life and
00:10:25 can say this man lives according to  It
00:10:28 doesn't seem like a very healthy way, I
00:10:31 can, we can have different
00:10:33 different scales, different standards
00:10:35 for what we consider acceptable, no,
00:10:39 but I think that from the point of
00:10:41 view of government law it doesn't matter
00:10:44 because in the end what you're
00:10:46 trying
00:10:50 to balance is  find a balance between
00:10:52 good if the restrictions or the
00:10:56 pressures in this case there are no
00:10:57 restrictions but the pressures that you put
00:11:01 on the citizens to try to make them
00:11:03 behave  in a certain way and then
00:11:05 the pressure that you put in terms of
00:11:08 taxes that these people have to
00:11:11 pay to treat all the people who are
00:11:14 obese and have problems stemming from their
00:11:17 behaviors not smoking from alcohol
00:11:19 from eating too much sugar and so on and
00:11:23 this is something that  It also affects us
00:11:24 all and I think that one thing that is
00:11:28 also taken into account when thinking about
00:11:31 these measures is the amount of
00:11:33 public spending there is to deal with this
00:11:36 health problem,
00:11:38 well, in that sense I am also not
00:11:41 very optimistic  Because I don't
00:11:44 think that the taxes that are collected are
00:11:47 of this type because this type of
00:11:51 tax is this money that is collected.
00:11:53 I don't think that this measure is going to be invested
00:11:58 in health care
00:12:02 , it is that more taxes are collected,
00:12:06 but it is that  there is no need
00:12:08 to invest in healthcare healthcare
00:12:11 will already spend less if this measure takes
00:12:14 effect and there are fewer people who drink
00:12:16 sugary drinks obesity will be reduced
00:12:19 and less will be needed  money to
00:12:21 treat people with poor health, no, but
00:12:24 it is also expected to collect,
00:12:27 it is not, it is not, it is not something that by putting
00:12:31 this, by putting this tax, people
00:12:36 will stop consuming, nothing will be
00:12:38 collected, of course, it will be collected
00:12:40 from  In fact, I believe that the real objective of
00:12:43 taxes like this is not to help the
00:12:46 population, it is to raise money in a
00:12:49 way that is
00:12:51 good that people see more or less as
00:12:54 something justified. I do not think that it is the
00:12:57 money that is collected that is later going to be
00:12:59 invested.  in that because you are saying
00:13:02 is that these people that is what you
00:13:04 were telling me that these people in the
00:13:06 end have to contribute more because they are
00:13:09 going to need more medical attention in some way they are
00:13:11 going to have more
00:13:14 health problems let's say that that is
00:13:16 one of  the
00:13:17 arguments
00:13:20 but I don't really think that
00:13:23 taxes work if I think
00:13:25 that governments invest those taxes
00:13:28 in what they consider and each
00:13:30 government is different from the governments
00:13:32 also each  For four years
00:13:36 and not taxes, they are invested in
00:13:41 good, basically
00:13:45 in projects that politicians
00:13:49 think will ultimately help them
00:13:52 stay in power, whatever it is,
00:13:55 that investment cannot be that maybe
00:13:59 a government says, well, we're going to
00:14:02 collect so much money for the
00:14:04 sugar tax but we are not going to reinvest that money
00:14:06 in
00:14:09 health we are going to reinvest it in giving a
00:14:12 subsidy to that sector
00:14:17 in this case it does not matter where
00:14:19 the money is invested because there will be
00:14:21 less expenses and to begin with it will go away  not to
00:14:22 spend less on health and I think they
00:14:25 are two completely independent problems it
00:14:27 is clear that we want
00:14:29 taxes to be spent in a
00:14:30 useful way but it has little to do
00:14:34 with raising the tax here or
00:14:37 elsewhere or on something else
00:14:39 and  Well, that's what I'm saying, no, I don't think it's
00:14:42 not so clear that the fact that you
00:14:46 reduce sugary drinks doesn't
00:14:50 mean that there will be less spending
00:14:53 on healthcare later, I think that's
00:14:56 a way of p  think that it doesn't
00:14:59 really respond to us with the world we
00:15:04 live in you have access to whatever you
00:15:06 want you ok you can't you can't drink
00:15:10 coke you can't drink
00:15:11 sugary drinks but you can you can make yourself a
00:15:15 coffee with a lot of sugar at home you
00:15:17 can you can  buy a lot of pastries
00:15:20 you can buy yourself I go and every time and
00:15:23 super cheap donuts and whatever and in the end the
00:15:27 person who doesn't care
00:15:30 about their health is not going to worry
00:15:33 anyway you can't force
00:15:35 someone to worry  Because of his health, he
00:15:38 acquires to be healthier, that is my,
00:15:41 let's say,
00:15:43 for me the most important argument is
00:15:46 that you cannot force nor should you,
00:15:48 so there are people who, although there are
00:15:52 many drugs that are illegal, and those
00:15:54 people look for those illegal drugs and
00:15:57 pay for them.  Illegal drugs and they break
00:15:59 the law and all because they want to because they
00:16:03 want to consume that drug
00:16:06 or that substance so I think that you
00:16:11 don't stay the same the obstacles that you put
00:16:14 each person will finally  to be free and
00:16:19 that's why it doesn't seem right to me
00:16:22 because it's what we want I believe
00:16:25 I believe that everyone wants to have
00:16:27 that freedom to decide and I want I
00:16:30 want to have my standard and I want to say
00:16:32 well well this seems to me
00:16:36 It seems to me that this is how I want to live
00:16:38 this is a balanced life for me
00:16:42 and perhaps this balanced life happens
00:16:44 every day before eating having
00:16:47 a Coke with some chips and
00:16:51 for someone else it could be drinking a
00:16:53 glass of wine at lunch  and for another
00:16:56 person it may just be eating
00:16:57 broccoli
00:16:59 I think that no matter how much studies they do, in the
00:17:02 end you cannot intervene so much in
00:17:06 a person's life
00:17:08 I don't know I think it is a somewhat strange point of view
00:17:10 because even when trying to
00:17:14 change
00:17:17 habits and activities it doesn't  I know the average of
00:17:20 the population with a decision of a
00:17:23 person at a specific moment that a
00:17:25 decision well me at any time
00:17:27 even if I want to have a healthy life
00:17:29 I can drink a coke no but it is
00:17:35 Of course, the measures, for example, to reduce the number of smokers have
00:17:38 worked and much fewer people in
00:17:40 Spain smoke than before and there are many
00:17:44 countries that have taken measures to
00:17:45 try to reduce the amount that is drunk
00:17:48 and it is still legal for people to buy
00:17:51 alcoholic beverages, but  They have put in place
00:17:54 measures so that people drink less and
00:17:55 there are fewer
00:17:58 traffic accidents due to being drunk and I think
00:18:00 the discussion is more
00:18:03 about whether it's worth it and whether it's going to see
00:18:05 results. I don't agree with
00:18:07 waiting to see what the results are.
00:18:09 But saying you can't do anything to
00:18:13 change what people are going to do is not,
00:18:16 I think, a very extreme position and
00:18:19 it is not really based on the
00:18:20 experience we have with looking
00:18:24 for ways to encourage reducing
00:18:26 taxes or to discourage certain
00:18:28 behaviors by putting  certain
00:18:31 taxes and that there is not one that we
00:18:33 should not see from a moral point of view
00:18:36 as this should not be done but
00:18:39 that we have to see to see  what is it that
00:18:40 we lose and what is it that we gain and see
00:18:42 if it pays off no
00:18:47 yes I think so we have to see it
00:18:49 from a moral point of view in the end it
00:18:51 is the rights of the people that is of
00:18:54 course there is a point of view  moral
00:18:56 is the utilitarian point of view and
00:18:58 moral for me both are said to be good because
00:19:03 there is
00:19:06 really neither one nor the other, it does not hold up
00:19:10 with one or the other because what
00:19:12 you say about tobacco, for example,
00:19:16 I don't really know, I think  Good,
00:19:18 we are discussing our opinions a bit
00:19:19 and not a lot of data, but
00:19:23 tobacco has dropped a lot in Spanish in the
00:19:24 last two decades, yes, but to what
00:19:27 extent is this low tobacco consumption
00:19:32 simply the result of people
00:19:36 being much more aware that
00:19:40 tobacco is  Very harmful,
00:19:43 does it have to do with a higher tax or
00:19:46 does it have to do with the fact that as a society
00:19:49 we already know that
00:19:52 tobacco has all kinds of
00:19:55 health contraindications that it
00:19:58 causes cancer, which is good, apart from everything
00:20:02 else, it ages.  The skin is clean, the teeth are
00:20:04 all of this, we all see it, we know it
00:20:09 and the people, well,
00:20:11 I think that
00:20:14 the fact that this contraindication has been established in
00:20:17 such a clear way
00:20:21 also makes people make that
00:20:25 decision not to consume tobacco, there are
00:20:28 many people  It is clear that there are
00:20:29 many very rich people who do not smoke and
00:20:34 many poor people who do smoke,
00:20:36 so the
00:20:39 fact that tobacco is very expensive
00:20:41 discourages people from smoking
00:20:46 because people look for their own ways to
00:20:49 smoke.  The one who wants to does it in the end, no,
00:20:53 and in fact, with the
00:20:55 generalization that did not conform to
00:20:57 reality, the one who wants to does it well, it does not
00:20:59 depend. There are people who wanted to but
00:21:02 have quit smoking because they have seen that
00:21:04 they spend too much money every  month is
00:21:08 okay yes yes it may be that within your
00:21:12 economy I say it is good because this does not
00:21:16 compensate me or I need to spend investing my
00:21:19 money in a slightly more useful cost if it
00:21:21 can be it can be but
00:21:25 but who  But in the end I shouldn't say
00:21:31 because because I've read
00:21:35 it a lot, yes, I've heard it all,
00:21:37 some people saying, well, but it's
00:21:40 just that the poorest people are the ones
00:21:44 who consume these less healthy products
00:21:46 and I don't know about tobacco  If
00:21:49 the lower social classes are also
00:21:52 the ones that consume the most tobacco,
00:21:54 I wouldn't be surprised either, but I'm not
00:21:58 saying why put that tax and that it
00:22:02 will precisely affect the
00:22:04 lower classes more, who are the ones who
00:22:06 consume these products the most
00:22:09 if I don't know with the  tobacco
00:22:12 yes yes it is the same but I
00:22:14 had also read this about I think when they
00:22:17 were talking about implementing it in the
00:22:19 US about the fact that the
00:22:21 lower classes buy more
00:22:25 soft drinks no and sugary drinks well
00:22:28 yes well thanks to this they will stop
00:22:30 buying them  and they will have a healthier life and
00:22:34 the parents will be able to take care of the children
00:22:36 live longer and take care of them more
00:22:38 years
00:22:39 and really have more years of
00:22:42 working life in which they can better  In spite of their
00:22:45 condition and such, they also
00:22:48 continue to be free to choose
00:22:50 how they spend their money and to be able to see what is
00:22:53 worth now, a Coke costs me this.
00:22:55 I prefer instead, baby, instead of this, to
00:22:57 drink water
00:22:59 and
00:23:02 that's it.
00:23:04 Initially, I spent on Coca-Cola and
00:23:06 buying a cost that is equivalent
00:23:09 to having the same amount
00:23:12 of sugar and
00:23:15 if it is what you have mentioned before,
00:23:18 we have to see this if I don't know either, I
00:23:20 'm not sure to what extent, well, they would
00:23:22 try to replace that  a bad habit
00:23:25 with another another bad habit no in fact
00:23:28 juan yes yes in fact when I did
00:23:32 this experiment in the city of
00:23:33 philadelphia or
00:23:37 whatever this experiment is I mean they
00:23:39 raised taxes on
00:23:41 sugary drinks there it was
00:23:44 seen that many people did  what I was doing was
00:23:47 going out of town to
00:23:50 buy drinks
00:23:52 a supermarket outside the city or
00:23:55 outside this area easy it is clear
00:23:58 that it can be done
00:23:59 clear and I  I think there are easy alternatives,
00:24:05 maybe not to a sugary drink,
00:24:07 but you can, you can develop another
00:24:11 habit,
00:24:14 it's not necessarily, it
00:24:16 could even be a worse habit.
00:24:27 what to do now with that money, well,
00:24:31 no one can say that it will be
00:24:34 for the better. Well, yes, I think that today we have more or
00:24:37 less touched on all the
00:24:38 different aspects, the different
00:24:41 areas in which this discussion touches, it
00:24:43 would be interesting to know more
00:24:46 about what you are commenting on and  if it happens if
00:24:48 there have been cases of looking or looking we
00:24:51 have raised taxes on alcohol and
00:24:54 now we have more zero and no hands no
00:24:56 digital drug addicts but well yes well
00:24:59 I think it has been a very very
00:25:01 interesting debate I think also if it continues to
00:25:04 be subject to  No opinion and therefore
00:25:08 we have not reached any
00:25:10 definitive conclusion either
00:25:11 and well I hope that you have
00:25:14 liked this debate a little more  A few
00:25:17 final words to add, soul, no, the
00:25:20 truth is that I don't think I've already told you,
00:25:25 come bye bye bye
00:25:31 ah
00:25:32 [Music]

20,"00:00:00 Today I am going to tell you about a trip I took
00:00:03 with my mother and my girlfriend in which
00:00:05 we went to take care of elephants
00:00:11 [Music]
00:00:14 hello, well, yes, he went I think it was
00:00:19 last April two or three months ago in
00:00:23 April I went with a with my  with my mother
00:00:29 and my girlfriend we went to shanghai food
00:00:31 nuevos for a week a week a
00:00:33 few days to chang mike and because it was
00:00:36 great it was the thai new year in
00:00:39 thailand the new year has its own
00:00:41 day that is in spring is
00:00:44 when the  year, their Thai year and
00:00:50 as the year traditionally began,
00:00:52 now they have our calendar and they also
00:00:54 start counting the years from
00:00:56 January 1, just like we do, but
00:00:59 traditionally they used a
00:01:01 lunar calendar and the year began in
00:01:05 spring more or less, so we went  to
00:01:08 chang may for they are big and the
00:01:10 songkran itself is very fun in the new year
00:01:13 this thai you see people on the street
00:01:16 throwing water at each other with water guns
00:01:18 and buckets and such and maybe they will make a
00:01:21 video explaining it and  l songkran but today
00:01:24 I am not going to talk about songkran I am going to
00:01:26 talk about something else another activity that
00:01:29 we did there in shanghai which was to go
00:01:31 take care of elephants because well the
00:01:34 elephant is a very characteristic animal
00:01:38 of Thailand it is the animal of the country and to
00:01:42 the Thais well  Thais
00:01:44 love elephants they really like
00:01:46 elephants and it is a bit like a symbol
00:01:49 of the country also if you go to the
00:01:52 tourist areas you will see that many t-shirts,
00:01:55 many pants
00:01:56 and bags and such that they sell have drawings
00:01:59 of elephants
00:02:02 so what happens well that
00:02:04 traditionally elephants  They were used, well,
00:02:07 in the fields they were used to do
00:02:09 work or to exert force to do
00:02:12 work that requires strength,
00:02:15 not last and well, and that's
00:02:18 good lately, because we don't need it anymore
00:02:21 because we have machines, we have
00:02:23 tractors and so on
00:02:25 and now, well,  Some elephants
00:02:29 are used for tours to give your
00:02:32 bag to tourists so that the
00:02:34 tourists sit down and get on the elephant and
00:02:38 Use using the elephant to go
00:02:40 for a walk, not
00:02:43 then, lately there is more and more
00:02:46 awareness that this is perhaps not
00:02:48 very good for elephants, there have also
00:02:50 been several reports from some
00:02:53 elephant owners, since they do not treat them very
00:02:55 well  Apart from the fact of getting on the
00:02:57 elephant, which I no longer know, it could be that
00:02:59 for the elephant it is something, it is something bad,
00:03:02 it is something that requires a lot of effort
00:03:03 that it does not like very much,
00:03:06 but besides that, there are some
00:03:09 elephant owners who do not treat them very well.
00:03:11 well and they have come out news
00:03:13 came out images of cases in which
00:03:15 that happened
00:03:17 now as there is more and more
00:03:19 awareness well lately what have
00:03:22 emerged in thailand are
00:03:25 rehabilitation centers centers
00:03:28 that care for elephants that
00:03:31 recover elephants from places where they were
00:03:35 they treat very well or elephants that were
00:03:38 used to load to give
00:03:41 tourists rides and such
00:03:43 because they give them a place where they take better care of them
00:03:46 I will try to pass quickly  Or so as
00:03:48 not to
00:03:50 get the elephants wet, because they are in a place
00:03:52 where they are cared for, supposedly they are taken
00:03:55 care of better, of course, that is something that you
00:03:58 as a visitor to the center there, it is a
00:04:01 bit difficult to know exactly,
00:04:04 but the place where we went, well,
00:04:07 the elephants were  well they seemed fine
00:04:10 they had no injuries it didn't seem like
00:04:12 they were sick or
00:04:15 had problems no
00:04:17 so in these centers you can
00:04:19 pay and for a day or a few days you can go
00:04:22 and feed the elephants to
00:04:25 wash them accompany them but you never get on
00:04:28 you never get off  you climb on top of the
00:04:29 elephants then just for that reason well
00:04:32 I think it's a slightly more ethical way
00:04:33 not to be in contact with the animals
00:04:35 that are impressive animals because
00:04:39 well if I wanted to I could kill the
00:04:42 animal with the size it has it could
00:04:45 step on you  and well and it almost happened to me I
00:04:47 had a bit of a scare and now I
00:04:51 'm going to explain it to you but hey 33
00:04:54 people went to the east center of elephants
00:04:58 picks you up  n with a van in the
00:05:01 morning a van comes to the place
00:05:02 where you are at the hotel and the van picks you up, it
00:05:05 goes through several places and well
00:05:08 in thailand normally the tours are
00:05:10 like that they work in this way any
00:05:12 activity any tour you hire
00:05:14 they come to pick you up with a  van
00:05:16 goes through several hotels and they take them to the
00:05:19 site
00:05:20 so they took us to the east center
00:05:22 to start they already gave us clothes their
00:05:25 own clothes clothes because you get dirty you
00:05:28 're going to get dirty because you're going to play in the
00:05:30 mud with the elephants you go to the river to
00:05:32 wash them then already  They know that your
00:05:34 clothes are quite dirty and the first thing
00:05:37 you do is change,
00:05:38 then they give you some bananas and they give you
00:05:42 [Music]
00:05:43 cucumbers because the elephants also
00:05:46 seem to like cucumbers and
00:05:49 you spend a while feeding the
00:05:51 elephant afterwards  you are going to cut the sugar
00:05:55 cane sugar cane they are the canes no
00:05:57 what they
00:06:00 have are good they are sweet they have a lot of
00:06:02 sugar and it is one of the ways
00:06:05 sugar is made  how sugar is produced
00:06:09 normal white sugar that you
00:06:10 find in the supermarket well, a lot
00:06:13 of it comes from sugar cane
00:06:16 so they have sugar cane
00:06:18 cut there that they have cut from their
00:06:20 field and you go and have to cut it into
00:06:23 smaller pieces and  You have to cut them in
00:06:26 half
00:06:28 to make them easier
00:06:30 for the elephants to chew and eat so you
00:06:33 cut them into small pieces like this more
00:06:35 or less with a machete they give you a machete
00:06:37 and well you have to be a little careful
00:06:39 but  They teach you a safe technique how to
00:06:41 do it safely so as not to
00:06:43 hurt yourself and well, I was there
00:06:47 cutting sugar cane and later when
00:06:50 we had already cut a lot of sugar
00:06:52 cane you go and feed it to the
00:06:54 elephants who also like it a lot
00:06:55 they really like to eat sugar cane
00:06:58 after that you go to the mud pool
00:07:01 there is a small swamp not the swamp
00:07:04 after where there is a place where there is
00:07:07 mud and the elephants  Well, they get in there,
00:07:09 you can also get in at the end.
00:07:12 Two or three
00:07:14 of us got in. Most of the people didn't get in in
00:07:16 all.
00:07:20 I think we
00:07:23 were like two or three people,
00:07:24 only my girlfriend got in.
00:07:27 My girlfriend also got in and
00:07:29 I put a little mud on her, she told me she did
00:07:33 n't want to get sunburned and what
00:07:37 I did to avoid getting burned because it
00:07:38 was also quite sunny and  I hadn't put
00:07:40 on sun cream so I took mud or
00:07:43 mud from the ground and I put it all around
00:07:45 here
00:07:45 rockrose to cover myself so as not to
00:07:47 burn myself and it helped me in the end I didn't burn
00:07:51 so if the elephants get into the
00:07:54 mud a bit they lie down  so I mud
00:07:56 over it and then it goes to the river and to the river
00:08:00 so everyone came I don't know if
00:08:02 everyone got into the water but hey
00:08:05 we all went to the river together with the
00:08:07 elephants the river is also there
00:08:09 very close to the center
00:08:13 they give you like some  buckets some small
00:08:15 buckets of water that have a handle and that is
00:08:20 very good to take water and
00:08:21 pour it also to pour a lot of
00:08:23 water and we were, well, pouring water to
00:08:26 the elephants no what happens that I
00:08:29 was there pouring a lot of water I was not
00:08:31 there  come water for this water so
00:08:33 that water for everyone water water
00:08:35 water and at some point the
00:08:40 little elephant got angry with me I don't know I don't know
00:08:42 what I did but there was a little
00:08:45 elephant an elephant well it's not like that more or less it
00:08:47 was he knew that  It was no longer a baby but it was
00:08:49 like a child it was a small elephant
00:08:53 and it was throwing water one by one big one
00:08:55 it is not it was not throwing it at the
00:08:57 little one but it was throwing water yes
00:08:59 quite vigorously with enough
00:09:01 force
00:09:03 and the little one I don't know if he thought that  I
00:09:05 was hurting his dad or his
00:09:07 mom or something but he started to attack me he
00:09:10 started to run towards me and oh my
00:09:13 gosh I got more scared it's pretty clear pretty
00:09:15 clear because let's see the elephant is like that
00:09:18 but I don't know if it will weigh 80  0 kilos, that is,
00:09:24 if it could have also hurt me a lot
00:09:27 and I was also in the river, what happens
00:09:29 if I sink into the river
00:09:31 in the water
00:09:40 ?  It happens that the bed of the river, the
00:09:44 floor at the bottom, let's say of the river, was
00:09:48 also like dirt or mud, it
00:09:49 was a bit sticky so I noticed
00:09:52 that my shoes were sticking. I had
00:09:55 shoes like these and I noticed that they were
00:09:57 sticking to the bottom and of course my reaction was to
00:10:00 try  stretch entity and try to
00:10:02 bring the shoe for me but then I saw
00:10:05 that oysters that I was not running away that
00:10:08 the elephant was coming and in the end I
00:10:10 had to turn back I left the shoes
00:10:13 there and well in the end the elephant did
00:10:18 not touch me it did not hurt me I could  I was able to go
00:10:20 back and not get hurt
00:10:23 but
00:10:24 I lost a pair of shoes and we found one shoe
00:10:27 we found it there by the
00:10:29 water but I don't know what happened to the other one
00:10:31 but well that day I lost a
00:10:33 shoe  That's why now I have new shoes,
00:10:36 but yes, the only thing, the only
00:10:41 mishap, not having, nothing happens, no better,
00:10:44 that the elephant would have hurt me,
00:10:46 I still don't know why that
00:10:48 anger is, it makes me a little sorry, but
00:10:50 well
00:10:51 , maybe you would think that  He was doing
00:10:54 something to his parents, I don't know,
00:10:57 well, apart from that, well, that was a
00:10:59 good experience.
00:11:01 I've already heard that it's good that these centers,
00:11:03 well, there are quite a
00:11:05 few, there are a few, there are a few, and the elephants don't
00:11:07 necessarily treat them very well,
00:11:10 although they also  It is a
00:11:11 business and in a certain way, well, they
00:11:13 were also exploiting the elephants, but
00:11:16 well, maybe within what fits
00:11:18 within the options of places where
00:11:20 elephants can live, well, this is one
00:11:22 of the best options. I don't know, I don't know
00:11:25 the subject in detail.  and well that's it this
00:11:28 is the end of the story of how I lost
00:11:31 a shoe thanks thanks to a little
00:11:35 elephant okay
00:11:38 come see you later
00:11:43 [Music]

18,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about the selectivity
00:00:02 of the entrance exams to the
00:00:04 university of Spain'
00:00:08 [Music]
00:00:12 well, if the selectivity is the
00:00:16 exams that must be taken to enter
00:00:19 the university in Spain' at least
00:00:21 the most common way is  The way
00:00:23 most people study to enter
00:00:26 a university in Spain is by taking
00:00:29 the selectivity so the selectivity
00:00:31 is a series of exams there are several
00:00:33 exams that are taken over three days
00:00:36 at least I took them over three
00:00:38 days if it hasn't changed  If nothing has changed
00:00:40 then it is done in those three days
00:00:43 it is done at the end of the
00:00:45 at the end of the academic year at the end of the academic year
00:00:47 and it is the same exam for
00:00:50 everyone everyone takes the same
00:00:52 exam there are some differences
00:00:54 depending on  the autonomous community
00:00:57 within Spain, for example, I am from
00:01:00 Catalonia and in my case, I had to
00:01:01 take a Catalan exam and in other
00:01:04 places in other autonomous communities,
00:01:06 it may be a little different.  but
00:01:09 within an autonomous community
00:01:11 everyone takes the same exams with
00:01:14 some options when I took it
00:01:16 you could choose between history and
00:01:18 philosophy I chose one of the two and
00:01:21 I also chose a subject
00:01:24 depending on what you studied before
00:01:26 there are several options  you have to do
00:01:29 chemistry or physics
00:01:32 or industrial or mechanical technology there are
00:01:35 several options but this exam the
00:01:38 selectivity is useful for all
00:01:40 universities at least for
00:01:43 public universities you don't have to
00:01:45 take different exams to see if
00:01:47 you enter different universities that I
00:01:49 know there are  countries where it is like this countries like
00:01:51 japan each university sets its own
00:01:54 entrance exams and if you want to
00:01:56 apply for admission to several
00:01:58 universities you have to take a
00:02:00 lot of different exams no and in
00:02:02 spain' at least for
00:02:04 public universities it's the same
00:02:06 exam I don't know  for the private ones, I am not
00:02:08 sure if there are some that go with the
00:02:10 selectivity or that have  in your own
00:02:12 exam I don't know which one I don't know if there is any
00:02:14 difference in the private ones but the
00:02:16 public ones are worth the selectivity
00:02:19 the selectivity is normally done
00:02:22 after the baccalaureate and the
00:02:24 baccalaureate is the last two years
00:02:26 of secondary to the last two years of
00:02:28 school normally between  16 between the ages of
00:02:32 16 and 18, children
00:02:35 in Spain do their baccalaureate
00:02:39 and in the baccalaureate they already have to
00:02:41 specialize they already have to choose a
00:02:43 branch one of the different
00:02:45 baccalaureate options there is a baccalaureate of letters
00:02:47 there is a baccalaureate of
00:02:50 technology humanities  of science and art, at
00:02:54 least when I did it many
00:02:56 years ago, I think that more or less it
00:02:59 was still like that now, but well, there are
00:03:01 these five types depending on the
00:03:04 baccalaureate you choose, because you do some
00:03:06 subjects or others, I did the
00:03:08 technological one because sometimes  I liked
00:03:10 computers I liked technology
00:03:11 I did the technological baccalaureate
00:03:14 but even with the baccalaureate
00:03:16 you  I had to study history
00:03:18 and philosophy in the selectivity I did
00:03:21 history I evaluated myself in history I took a
00:03:23 history exam because I
00:03:26 studied philosophy in the first year of high school
00:03:28 and history is studied in the
00:03:30 second year of the second year so I thought I would
00:03:32 remember better the  history because it
00:03:34 hadn't been a year since I hadn't had a year
00:03:36 to forget it so I took the
00:03:39 history exam even though I liked
00:03:41 philosophy more than history it's not that
00:03:44 I don't like history I don't like
00:03:45 studying history I always study history
00:03:48 at school  It was very difficult for me
00:03:49 so I chose history instead of
00:03:52 philosophy and then there was another option
00:03:57 there were two other subjects of my
00:03:59 specialization from my high school that I
00:04:02 had to choose when I did
00:04:04 high school I had to choose
00:04:07 between chemistry and mechanics and I chose
00:04:11 chemistry but not in high school  I took the
00:04:13 chemistry exam no no well no these
00:04:17 options within my branch of
00:04:18 high school there were some options but
00:04:20 this lu  ego I did not have to examine myself in the
00:04:23 selectivity at the end of what I
00:04:25 examined is Spanish, Catalan,
00:04:29 English, History,
00:04:33 Mathematics, Physics and Industrial Technology, there
00:04:36 were 77 exams, seven exams
00:04:39 during three days, I think
00:04:42 and well, I am not going to tell you what  I didn't
00:04:44 get it but of course they weren't they weren't bad
00:04:47 no kidding I didn't do well I did
00:04:50 quite well but what matters later
00:04:53 to go to university is that
00:04:55 you don't have the grades you have the high school grade from the
00:04:57 high school itself from
00:04:59 when you're studying  At school, in
00:05:01 your school, they give you a grade and then
00:05:04 the selectivity exams are another grade
00:05:07 because the high school grade counted
00:05:09 at least when I did it, it counted
00:05:11 for 60% and the grade for the
00:05:15 selectivity exams counted for 40 percent.  percent
00:05:17 counted a little a little less so
00:05:20 when you calculate the total grade between the
00:05:23 baccalaureate and the selectivity then
00:05:25 depending on the grade you have you will be
00:05:28 able to enter the university you
00:05:30 want or  You will not be able to enter the
00:05:32 career you want because the career
00:05:34 or degree you want to study will have an
00:05:36 entry grade that depends on how many
00:05:39 people want to enter and the grades that
00:05:42 the people who want to enter have,
00:05:43 so if a thousand people want to enter
00:05:46 and only  One hundred fit because the 100 people
00:05:49 with a higher grade are the ones who will be
00:05:51 able to
00:05:53 enter some universities and in some
00:05:55 careers in some grades the grade
00:05:57 with which you have to enter is a 5 because
00:06:00 there aren't any because there are more places than people
00:06:03 who want  enter they have enough
00:06:04 places
00:06:05 anyone who has passed the
00:06:07 selectivity can enter but hey you have
00:06:09 to pass you can't have
00:06:10 failed you can't have gotten a 3 or 4 in the
00:06:13 selectivity you have to pass it
00:06:14 so in my case I wanted to study
00:06:17 computer science and computer science I wanted to
00:06:19 study computer science in  the
00:06:21 autonomous university of barcelona and at least the
00:06:24 year that i entered the entrance mark was
00:06:26 quite low the cut-off mark let's say
00:06:28 the  note in which they cut off the people who
00:06:30 can enter and the one who was not
00:06:32 low enough I think it was a six-odd
00:06:34 so I was able to enter without any
00:06:36 problem but there are people who want to
00:06:41 study medicine or want to study want to
00:06:43 study law to become a
00:06:45 lawyer  And in these careers, since
00:06:48 many people want to enter, the
00:06:49 cut-off grade is higher, it is more difficult to enter,
00:06:51 you have to study more than be a good
00:06:53 student, study and get good grades
00:06:55 during high school and in the
00:06:57 selectivity, I also took
00:06:59 the exams.
00:07:02 I did them at the same university
00:07:04 where I later studied at the autonomous university,
00:07:06 which is the
00:07:08 autonomous university of Barcelona, ​​which is on the
00:07:11 outskirts of Barcelona, ​​it is not within
00:07:13 the city of Barcelona, ​​and it is the
00:07:16 nearest large campus to where I  I lived
00:07:19 closer to my city and I think
00:07:21 that everyone in my city went to do the
00:07:24 selectivity to the autonomous we did the
00:07:26 selectivity there and yes, well I got
00:07:29 enough  It's not good enough and
00:07:31 I entered the career and well, I went to
00:07:33 study the computer science career there
00:07:35 on the same campus in the same
00:07:37 university that is the Autonomous University of
00:07:39 Barcelona. For me, the selectivity was not
00:07:41 very difficult, I don't know anymore  It is
00:07:45 very bad to
00:07:47 study to get good grades, it was not
00:07:50 very difficult for me in general at school I
00:07:53 got good grades but there was a
00:07:55 subject in particular that was
00:07:58 very difficult for me and in the second grade in
00:08:01 secondary school and in
00:08:03 high school it was  It was very difficult for
00:08:05 me and it was history for me,
00:08:08 for history it has always been the
00:08:10 subject that I have
00:08:12 dedicated the most time to, the one that I have
00:08:14 studied the longest because it simply
00:08:17 does not stay with me, I do not remember all the
00:08:18 information that you have to  to learn
00:08:21 and always, well, I study the
00:08:24 book, because several times I read it three or
00:08:26 four times and even so, I got very bad
00:08:28 grades.
00:08:35 well later in the
00:08:38 selectivity it was not bad for me that is, it was one of
00:08:41 the worst say I think it was the two
00:08:44 worst grades I got but it was not the
00:08:46 worst I think it was Catalan I would say
00:08:49 Catalan in the Catalan language exam
00:08:52 since it shows a little  Worse
00:08:56 than history but well in all of
00:08:59 them more than a 6 so I did
00:09:01 n't do badly
00:09:04 in some of the subjects I was the
00:09:07 first to leave the classroom the first to
00:09:09 leave the exam because they set a
00:09:12 time limit for leaving  You have to
00:09:14 wait at least, I don't know if it was half an
00:09:17 hour before the exam started,
00:09:19 because if someone arrives 20 minutes 25
00:09:22 minutes late, well, they can still come in, of
00:09:25 course, if you finish the exam in 15
00:09:27 minutes and leave, then you could
00:09:29 take them, you could give them the  answers to
00:09:31 another person and that person could enter
00:09:33 and get a better grade because they knew the
00:09:36 answers so that doesn't happen
00:09:38 so that if someone arrives late they
00:09:40 can enter up to 25 or 29 minutes late
00:09:44 because they have to pass p  or at least half an
00:09:46 hour 30 minutes to be able to leave the
00:09:48 classroom after finishing the exam
00:09:51 and if at least a couple of exams
00:09:54 I would say that one especially an exam
00:09:56 ends before 30
00:09:59 minutes and I said well I'll wait here
00:10:00 for you to arrive  After half an hour has passed,
00:10:04 that's a part of the story, well,
00:10:07 it wasn't very difficult for me later in
00:10:09 university, once I entered
00:10:10 university, it was a little more difficult, it
00:10:13 wasn't the first time that he failed an
00:10:15 exam,
00:10:15 I already think that the only  The first time
00:10:18 in my life that he failed an exam was
00:10:21 in high school it was in the last
00:10:23 two years of high school before going to
00:10:25 university
00:10:26 Oysters go away
00:10:29 but then in college
00:10:31 well I also failed some exams not
00:10:33 many and in the end I graduated from the
00:10:36 career in five years that my degree
00:10:40 was five years so five years is
00:10:42 not the most usual but well it is the minimum
00:10:44 no and I graduated well in the minimum time
00:10:46 that is is quite good
00:10:49 but hey I failed some  exams and
00:10:51 some exams I had to repeat and
00:10:53 some I had to do like three or
00:10:55 four times to finally pass the
00:10:58 no's and I let you know that the fly is bothering me
00:11:02 and I hope you liked this
00:11:04 this video is one of the first videos
00:11:07 I've made  At an advanced level, tell me
00:11:09 what you think if
00:11:12 this rhythm of speaking seems fine to you because I'm already
00:11:13 trying to speak quite fast, not that
00:11:15 I don't speak like that, I normally
00:11:17 talk with my family and friends and
00:11:19 such I speak quite quickly, surely in
00:11:21 general Spanish  We talk quite
00:11:23 fast but when I'm recording a
00:11:25 video well I'm thinking while I
00:11:26 'm talking I don't have to think about you a
00:11:28 little more than normal and sometimes it's hard for me to
00:11:31 keep up but
00:11:33 hey I try to talk like that fast
00:11:35 and well tell me what you think  What do you
00:11:37 think of this video? If
00:11:40 advanced videos like this one seem good to
00:11:42 you, or do you prefer that I do it a little differently or
00:11:44 that I abuse more jargon, more words?  broken
00:11:48 and things like that okay come see you later
00:11:56 [Music]
",4
11,"00:00:01 hello how are you welcome to the first
00:00:04 advanced level dreaming spanish video and it's
00:00:08 going to be the first advanced level video but
00:00:11 I'm going to make several advanced level videos
00:00:14 I'm going to try various ideas various
00:00:15 concepts to see which one you like best and
00:00:18 to see how in the future  It would have to
00:00:20 be the advanced level videos to
00:00:23 really help you to help you
00:00:25 get to the next level to get to the
00:00:28 next level of Spanish okay and this
00:00:31 first video this first idea is a
00:00:34 format in which I'm going to speak
00:00:36 faster I'm going to speak a little bit  faster
00:00:38 than in the intermediate level videos
00:00:40 I will I will speak at a natural speed at
00:00:43 the speed as I speak with my friends
00:00:46 as I speak with my family as I speak with
00:00:48 other native Spanish speakers and I
00:00:52 will speak using more colloquial Spanish
00:00:55 using slang using  The Spanish that I
00:00:57 would use with my friends with my
00:01:00 colleagues is fine and what better way than
00:01:03 to make a video like this in which I speak in
00:01:06 a more colloquial way than talking about
00:01:10 dating  colleagues to hang out with
00:01:11 colleagues with friends to go out for a
00:01:13 drink to go have a good time to go to a
00:01:15 party with friends and that will be the
00:01:18 topic of today's video
00:01:22 [Music]
00:01:24 ah
00:01:26 then come on, you have a date with your
00:01:28 colleagues, have you  meeting to go for a drink
00:01:30 to go to a bar for example or go to
00:01:33 dinner go to a restaurant and meet up with
00:01:35 colleagues because normally you stay with
00:01:37 the phone you use whatsapp
00:01:40 if you are a bit old-fashioned then maybe
00:01:42 you call colleagues and meet up in
00:01:45 a  place that you give an hour to go for a
00:01:47 drink maybe you meet in front of the
00:01:49 restaurant or maybe you meet at a
00:01:51 metro station for example if you live
00:01:53 in a place like madrid or barcelona
00:01:56 where there is a metro then you meet there
00:01:58 directly at the metro station
00:01:59 maybe
00:02:01 which one is  The first problem, especially in
00:02:03 Spain, when you stay with colleagues from
00:02:05 Spain, is that someone arrives late,
00:02:07 that someone does not arrive on time and
00:02:10 unfortunately, since it is our daily bread,
00:02:12 it is the most normal thing is that someone
00:02:14 arrives  late because sometimes the strange thing is
00:02:17 that someone arrives on time many times
00:02:19 I'm five minutes late and I'm the
00:02:22 first to arrive
00:02:23 and I say hell let's see what happened is that
00:02:26 I've been late is that I'm five
00:02:28 minutes late they've already left I know  They have
00:02:30 gone to the restaurant or they have gone to the
00:02:31 bar, it is not that I am too early
00:02:34 I have arrived first and I have to
00:02:36 wait maybe ten or fifteen
00:02:38 more minutes for everyone to arrive, well
00:02:40 yes, it happens many times
00:02:42 welcome to Spain the second
00:02:45 possibility  and something that also happens almost
00:02:47 every time you meet with colleagues is
00:02:49 that someone cancels that someone does not come
00:02:51 that someone does not show up and especially
00:02:54 nowadays because we all have cell phones it is
00:02:56 very easy to tell people that I am
00:02:59 going but after I have  One more plan, one more,
00:03:02 one better plan, there is a better plan,
00:03:04 someone sends you a message and tells you
00:03:06 well in
00:03:06 front of this party, this root, that we are
00:03:09 going to get drunk and have a drink
00:03:11 here that this band is playing or that this dj is playing
00:03:14 or whatever then, well, people
00:03:16 decide that there are better plans because it is
00:03:20 very easy to cancel nowadays, it is
00:03:21 very easy to tell colleagues that I am not going, in the
00:03:23 end I am not going, that another plan has come up with me
00:03:26 or that in the end I am doing something else and I am not going
00:03:28 So, well, a lot of people also have cancer,
00:03:31 with a bit of luck, if you're lucky, there
00:03:33 will be enough people who don't
00:03:35 cancel and you have a plan and you
00:03:38 can go out. You can go to dinner or go for a drink.
00:03:40 There aren't enough people, of course, that
00:03:43 makes it very difficult to make plans.  It is a
00:03:46 little difficult to make plans, especially it
00:03:47 is very difficult to be able to tell the
00:03:50 restaurant to make a reservation, to be able to make
00:03:52 a reservation, because in the
00:03:54 restaurant they will ask you how many
00:03:56 people you are going to be 15 maybe but
00:04:00 surely we will be less but of course if
00:04:03 you say 10  and in the end there are 12 or 13 of you and you don't
00:04:06 have enough places to sit down,
00:04:08 what do you do, unfortunately
00:04:11 , daily bread is what usually happens
00:04:13 when you make a reservation in a place, I
00:04:17 don't understand why  r why restaurants no
00:04:19 longer expect it and are no longer a little flexible
00:04:21 in terms of the number of people who are
00:04:23 going to show up no maybe they don't take it
00:04:26 out they are not used to
00:04:28 young people to people today the
00:04:30 way they  they usually make the plans and
00:04:32 how they usually end
00:04:34 up sometimes there are problems to
00:04:36 find if there are problems to
00:04:38 find the site such as not
00:04:40 everyone finds the site easily
00:04:43 because they are clueless or because they don't know how to
00:04:45 read maps because they don't know how to use google
00:04:47 maps or because  Sometimes someone sends you to
00:04:49 the address sends you the location on
00:04:52 whatsapp but it's not right it's not accurate
00:04:55 it's not exactly the place then
00:04:57 because there are different types different
00:04:59 types of people there are people who are
00:05:02 guided more by relative position by
00:05:05 directions
00:05:08 by signs of how  go to places you don't see go
00:05:11 up balmes street and the second on
00:05:13 the right and people who are guided more by
00:05:16 absolute position by maps and such and I
00:05:19 am one of those people who  If you
00:05:21 send me the exact position on a map, I
00:05:24 'll be there without any problem, but
00:05:26 if you send me a position like this here, more
00:05:28 or less, it's not true and you don't tell me,
00:05:31 for example, the street and the number or something, well,
00:05:34 maybe it works for me.  it will be difficult to find the
00:05:36 site and other people you send them the
00:05:39 exact position and they find it difficult to find
00:05:41 the site they need you to tell them how to
00:05:44 get there where to go because street
00:05:46 turn that you give them precise instructions
00:05:49 on how to get to the site how to get
00:05:50 exactly to the site but well past
00:05:54 the first problems to meet
00:05:56 and to stay on time
00:05:59 there is one thing that makes you forget
00:06:03 those initial problems that if you have
00:06:06 good and you have good friends and if
00:06:08 you have funny friends if you have
00:06:10 funny people if you have a clown in the
00:06:13 group well it usually does
00:06:15 forget about all the problems because it's
00:06:17 good if there are people there are funny
00:06:19 people there are really funny people and if you have
00:06:22 one of these a clown in the group then
00:06:23 normally  Before you forget about your
00:06:26 problems, then say that you have
00:06:30 arranged to go to a restaurant to go
00:06:32 to dinner,
00:06:33 you meet, you all go into the
00:06:36 restaurant today, some arrive earlier and the
00:06:38 others arrive later, but they arrive and
00:06:40 you are all having dinner and while you are
00:06:42 having dinner while  you are drinking or
00:06:44 having dinner because everyone is happy
00:06:47 and everyone is happy and
00:06:48 everyone is having a [ __ ] good time
00:06:50 but what happens after dinner you have
00:06:53 to pay and then more problems come
00:06:55 when you have to pay the money
00:06:58 because sometimes  Although, well, perhaps
00:07:01 even though we are all Spanish,
00:07:05 it does not seem that we all have the same
00:07:07 culture or that we have all the same
00:07:09 expectations because everyone expects to
00:07:11 pay in a different way,
00:07:14 everyone wants to pay in a different way,
00:07:16 normally most people a
00:07:20 Most people don't mind paying
00:07:21 all together, they don't mind paying everything, it's
00:07:24 the same amount
00:07:26 and well, it's okay if some have t  Had
00:07:29 two beers or one or eaten a
00:07:31 salad or eaten bravas or not
00:07:33 bravas no but there are always
00:07:35 exceptions and there are always people who
00:07:37 want to pay exactly the amount they
00:07:40 have eaten for the things they have ordered no
00:07:43 then the people who ask to pay
00:07:46 You have to tell them separately or
00:07:49 they have to tell you what they have, what
00:07:51 they have eaten or what they have ordered and
00:07:54 then deduct the total and what is
00:07:56 left over, then distribute it among the people
00:07:59 we want, basically
00:08:01 the people who give us sweat.  the same and that
00:08:03 we can pay that we want that we
00:08:06 don't care and that we don't mind paying a
00:08:09 proportional part the same pay everyone
00:08:11 the same not normally because those
00:08:13 people who remain in the end don't
00:08:16 care and I'm usually there
00:08:18 because when I go to dinner with  people I
00:08:21 don't take advantage of it I don't try to eat as much as
00:08:23 I can and then distribute it
00:08:25 among others and normally most
00:08:27 people are also like that they also don't
00:08:30 try to stuff themselves  as if it were a
00:08:32 free buffet of that
00:08:33 and then well, hang the dead on the
00:08:36 others and make the others have to
00:08:38 pay for their dinner and the easiest thing is if
00:08:41 in the restaurant they give you
00:08:43 separate bills if they make the bill
00:08:44 separately for each  person then it is
00:08:47 easier to pay what happens that in many
00:08:49 places they don't do it in many places they
00:08:51 don't give you a separate account for
00:08:53 lunch at noon maybe they will if they
00:08:55 are kind normally normally yes
00:08:57 they do but for dinner well in
00:08:59 many places  No, they don't do it, so
00:09:02 this is the most common thing that usually
00:09:05 happens, but there is one more level of
00:09:07 complication. One more thing that can
00:09:10 happen is that someone leaves without
00:09:13 paying the bill, that someone leaves
00:09:15 and has not paid their bill.  part not in
00:09:18 spain maybe this
00:09:20 has happened to me less but when i was in
00:09:22 japan it happened every two by three almost every
00:09:25 night that we went to have a drink someone
00:09:29 left and hadn't paid and then those of us who
00:09:31 were left at the end  Well, the
00:09:33 dead man was hanging on us and we had
00:09:34 to pay what was left
00:09:37 but something that does happen many times
00:09:40 in Spain is that each one pays their part
00:09:44 or pays their proportional part or pays
00:09:47 what they think they think they have that they have
00:09:49 consumed  that they have eaten put the money
00:09:51 but in the end there is not enough money in the end there
00:09:54 is not enough money of course what happens
00:09:57 that sometimes people who pay separately
00:10:00 or people who only want to pay for what
00:10:02 they have eaten are not paying for what they
00:10:04 have eaten they are paying  what they have
00:10:06 ordered but
00:10:09 alvarito you have not asked for engraves but
00:10:12 you have eaten or you have eaten engraves perhaps you have not
00:10:14 asked for them but you have eaten them
00:10:16 where the money for the bravas
00:10:18 is because for some reason money is missing and
00:10:23 alvarito that you have not asked for  but you have
00:10:24 eaten and well another common problem is
00:10:27 that someone gets drunk not because at
00:10:30 dinner it is typical to drink wine or drink
00:10:32 sangria and well it could be that someone gets
00:10:34 drunk but well this is the type of
00:10:37 problem  It is more usual than the one
00:10:39 we are more used to and normally, well,
00:10:41 we have a way of
00:10:44 taking care of that person according to a plan or a
00:10:47 way that we are already used to,
00:10:49 because we take care of that person who has
00:10:51 crossed the line, who has gotten drunk,
00:10:54 even if they were vomiting  No,
00:10:57 normally, well, you have to take care of that
00:10:59 person and that's what there is, it's a colleague, it's
00:11:01 a friend and you have to take care of him,
00:11:04 but something worse, the truth is that
00:11:07 people get angry when between friends or
00:11:10 even between boyfriend and girlfriend get
00:11:12 bitten  that they get angry with each other and
00:11:15 then, well, there is bad vibes among the whole
00:11:17 group and for the rest of the night
00:11:18 normally if there is any anger if there is
00:11:21 someone who gets angry normally for
00:11:23 the rest of the night they have screwed you already
00:11:25 there is bad vibes in  The atmosphere does
00:11:28 n't go away anymore, but well, assuming that everything has
00:11:31 gone well, that
00:11:34 the restaurant bill has been paid and that there have
00:11:37 been no disagreements among the group, then
00:11:39 you have to choose where you go because
00:11:41 sometimes you don't  or it has been decided where to go
00:11:43 after the restaurant if you go to a
00:11:45 bar or if you go to a disco or something
00:11:48 then you have to decide and how
00:11:52 the group decides because as good
00:11:55 democrats that we are living in a
00:11:57 democracy we vote and obviously nothing  not
00:12:00 normally in the group there is someone who is in
00:12:02 charge there is someone that no one has chosen
00:12:04 no one has voted no one has said if this
00:12:06 person is going to choose it is not that
00:12:09 naturally there is a person who
00:12:11 has more energy a person in whom
00:12:13 one trusts  A good person,
00:12:16 basically, normally it is the person
00:12:19 who decides for himself, he decides
00:12:22 for himself, well, we are going and the others are fine,
00:12:25 as it is the easiest. In the end, not having
00:12:28 to choose oneself is the easiest,
00:12:30 because normally we accept anyone
00:12:32 who comes and decides.  who is in charge, well,
00:12:36 normally he is allowed to, there are usually
00:12:38 no disagreements between people who want to
00:12:40 rule or who want to choose where
00:12:46 they go.  It's very easy
00:12:49 because most people would
00:12:51 be a guarantee, it's easier for me that way I don't
00:12:54 have to make decisions
00:12:56 and that's it, we've reached the
00:12:59 end of the video. I've told you a little about
00:13:01 what problems there can be when you
00:13:05 stay when you leave  Colleagues, but
00:13:07 hey, don't think that most
00:13:09 things are bad because there is a reason
00:13:11 why we keep meeting and going
00:13:13 out with colleagues, which is that we have a
00:13:15 [ __ ] good time, and
00:13:17 normally we like each other because they are
00:13:19 good people and because normally  Well,
00:13:22 there's some clown in the
00:13:24 group that makes
00:13:27 us break our ass and break our asses and
00:13:29 spend a [ __ ]
00:13:31 night okay come see you next time
00:13:39 [Music]
00:13:41 and
00:13:42 [Music]
",4
16,"00:00:00 hello good this is the second
00:00:05 advanced level video that I am going to do the idea
00:00:08 is to make a slightly different format a
00:00:11 little different from the other video instead of
00:00:15 using colloquial language I am not going to use
00:00:19 so much colloquial language and swear words
00:00:21 I am going to speak more  normal as
00:00:24 I speak normally but I am not going to
00:00:27 pronounce I am also going to pronounce a
00:00:29 bit as I also speak with colleagues
00:00:31 and family age that without perhaps without
00:00:34 pronouncing the words so clearly
00:00:36 I don't know if I will be able to because I am
00:00:39 speaking now I am speaking to the
00:00:41 camera and I'm a bit in dreaming
00:00:43 mode Spanish no I'm not I'm not talking
00:00:44 how I talk to him how I talk to a colleague or
00:00:47 someone in my family I'm going to try
00:00:50 I'm going to try to speak as I
00:00:51 would speak to someone who was here
00:00:53 that I know speaks  Spanish that he
00:00:55 speaks well and that I don't have to pronounce
00:00:57 all of them super clearly just like I'm
00:01:00 doing now and I'm going to try not to do
00:01:03 that I don't know if it's going to work out I don't know if it's going to
00:01:05 work  r but hey
00:01:06 I'm going to try tell me what you think of this
00:01:09 video if it seems a bit similar to the
00:01:11 last one I did because the last video
00:01:13 I did is also that I removed
00:01:16 something very similar, maybe in the end you
00:01:18 will not see very clearly the difference
00:01:19 between the  formats well only in
00:01:22 this new one and I'm not going to use so
00:01:23 much colloquial language so much jargon and so many
00:01:26 swear words or I'm not going to use them I'm going to
00:01:28 try to speak in the same way that
00:01:31 I speak in the using the same vocabulary
00:01:33 the same words that he used in the
00:01:35 intermediate videos  but a little
00:01:37 faster and without pronouncing everything
00:01:41 so clearly without such a
00:01:43 clear pronunciation and well this video is going to be about
00:01:48 the passwords about the passwords and
00:01:50 about the usernames of all
00:01:53 the accounts that we have to make
00:01:55 to be a member of the  current society
00:02:01 [Music]
00:02:05 so we all know this problem
00:02:07 that we go to a new web page we
00:02:10 want to sign up for a web page and
00:02:13 it asks us to put the email
00:02:15 Normally the email always asks for the
00:02:16 email the email the username the
00:02:18 password and we have to put the
00:02:20 username
00:02:21 nowadays maybe not many sites
00:02:24 ask for it but the email and the password as well
00:02:26 the password or the password not
00:02:29 the first problem already  it is in the
00:02:32 username if it asks for your email nothing
00:02:34 normally happens if it asks for your email well if
00:02:37 it says no this email is repeated well
00:02:39 then what happens is that you
00:02:41 forgot you forgot that you had already
00:02:43 made a user in this in  their website but
00:02:46 normally you tell them to recover the
00:02:47 password and they send you a link and you can
00:02:49 reset you can put another
00:02:52 password again you can establish a new
00:02:54 password and it is not a problem what happens
00:02:57 in the sites that ask a user to
00:02:59 put their username
00:03:00 there  the potential exists the
00:03:02 possibility that this user is
00:03:04 repeated that someone has already
00:03:06 signed up with your username
00:03:08 or when you open an email account
00:03:09 when you open an account in gm  ail or in
00:03:12 another email service, well, there is also
00:03:14 that problem that the name is
00:03:15 repeated and it bothers a lot, it is not
00:03:18 a problem because if it is a very
00:03:21 popular service that many people use, it will
00:03:23 normally cost you a while, you will spend a
00:03:25 lot of time testing  testing
00:03:27 usernames testing variations
00:03:29 of the username you always use
00:03:31 so you put your username
00:03:33 then the username followed by
00:03:35 the year you were born or followed by
00:03:38 a number that you always use
00:03:40 but then you have to remember you have
00:03:42 to remember  that the
00:03:43 username you used and it is very complicated if in the
00:03:45 end you have to use a name changing
00:03:47 the name putting it in numbers is
00:03:50 quite complicated luckily
00:03:52 nowadays many websites allow you to login
00:03:54 with facebook or with google they let you
00:03:56 tell  google or facebook give you
00:03:59 permission so that you can identify yourself you
00:04:01 can enter that website only with
00:04:03 your google or facebook data you
00:04:05 don't have to create a n  ombre of
00:04:06 new user or a new password but many
00:04:09 sites
00:04:10 do not have a login with facebook or
00:04:13 google or even if they do they also make you
00:04:16 put a password that you say
00:04:18 what the meaning is if you already know it's
00:04:21 me why ask me for another password a
00:04:23 new password the  The idea of ​​logging in
00:04:26 with facebook or google is not
00:04:27 having to enter another password and well
00:04:30 then it asks you for the password what happens that
00:04:32 many times you end up using the same
00:04:34 password because you can't
00:04:37 remember 200 300 400 different passwords
00:04:40 that you use the same password  or you use one
00:04:43 of the few different passwords that
00:04:45 you have that happens that some sites
00:04:48 ask you for the length that has a
00:04:50 minimum length that has to be
00:04:52 at least 8 letters or 12 letters
00:04:54 so you take a password that
00:04:57 you already have and maybe the  you extend or put
00:05:00 more numbers or make a longer version
00:05:01 but then it costs you more to remember
00:05:04 then it costs you to remember to see what
00:05:06 password I put on this website but  The
00:05:08 worst thing is when they ask you to have
00:05:10 capital letters that have numbers that have
00:05:12 symbols like you remember everything that
00:05:15 have numbers and symbols that you
00:05:17 normally do you have another version of
00:05:20 the same password but that you put a
00:05:23 number on it you put a symbol on it you change it
00:05:25 some letter you put some
00:05:27 capital letter normally the first but of
00:05:30 course then you already have four or
00:05:32 five or six different passwords
00:05:34 that you have to remember some
00:05:37 websites even have a fairly
00:05:39 low password limit at most 12
00:05:43 letters
00:05:44 at most 12 letters or  you are
00:05:46 asking me on purpose of being unsure
00:05:49 of having little security let me put 50
00:05:52 letters because you won't let me because you put
00:05:54 a maximum limit on how many letters
00:05:56 the password can have it doesn't cost you
00:05:59 cents of euro to send more
00:06:01 letters of the password or  save them in
00:06:04 your database
00:06:05 so I used to do it like this
00:06:06 normally I did it like this find a
00:06:09 password well quite l  long but not
00:06:11 too long with some numbers and they
00:06:13 always put it is the password I always
00:06:15 used the same when I could in the end
00:06:18 in practice you can't and I had
00:06:20 four or five different passwords
00:06:22 that I used to use in most places
00:06:24 what happens when it's been a long time
00:06:27 I haven't entered a website for a long time I have
00:06:28 n't entered I don't remember which of the
00:06:31 passwords I used I have to try I have
00:06:33 to try several I have to try
00:06:36 the different passwords It happens that
00:06:39 there are websites where at most they let you
00:06:42 try it three times they let you try it three
00:06:44 sometimes and then oh well, it comes back in five
00:06:47 minutes or it comes back in an hour and sometimes
00:06:49 the worst thing is that I was not wrong is that
00:06:52 I have put the correct password but I
00:06:55 had the caps lock I had had
00:06:58 the caps on and that's why it didn't
00:07:00 work that's why I hadn't entered  on
00:07:03 the web and it is good that nowadays with so many
00:07:06 logins, so many websites, so many services, it is
00:07:08 impossible to remember all the
00:07:10 passwords and the worst thing is that if you use
00:07:13 co  nsimilar passwords or use the use is the
00:07:15 same everywhere so it's a
00:07:19 big problem when
00:07:21 services are hacked because all services are
00:07:26 hacked sooner or later and a hacker comes in and discovers the passwords of a lot of
00:07:29 people who pass by and then your password
00:07:32 is discovered in  kindergarten or
00:07:35 whatever, then they test it on many websites with
00:07:39 the same email and the same password and
00:07:41 if you have them
00:07:42 you can enter gmail they can
00:07:44 enter amazon they can enter
00:07:46 everything they catch in everything
00:07:48 they prove you have  the same
00:07:49 password because the hackers are already there
00:07:51 in your accounts, so it is a very bad idea to
00:07:54 have the same password or have
00:07:56 similar passwords on different websites,
00:07:59 but it is impossible to remember all of what you
00:08:03 have to do because luckily today
00:08:06 there are password managers
00:08:08 There are things like the pas or one
00:08:12 password that I'm not
00:08:14 trying to promote because they pay me
00:08:16 because they don't pay me that so I recommend
00:08:18 that you use one  One of these things because it makes
00:08:20 the use of the Internet and the use of the mobile
00:08:23 even much more secure. The grace of
00:08:26 these password managers is
00:08:28 that they remember first, you don't have
00:08:30 to remember that allows you to have a
00:08:33 different password on all the websites.
00:08:34 Keep in mind  each website its unique password and
00:08:38 two that have
00:08:40 password generators they make you a
00:08:41 new password a password as
00:08:44 long as you want or as long as the
00:08:46 website allows if it allows 15 15
00:08:48 of 50/50 and they are
00:08:52 completely random random passwords whatever
00:08:55 they are  characters that are symbols that
00:08:59 are lowercase uppercase numbers a
00:09:02 password that is impossible to remember but
00:09:05 that the password manager remembers
00:09:07 and generates a different one for each website
00:09:09 you use so when hackers
00:09:11 enter a website they will not be able to use that
00:09:14 password to enter your accounts
00:09:16 on other websites and it is much more secure and
00:09:19 then with these
00:09:20 password managers you only have to
00:09:23 remember a password  what happens that
00:09:25 since you only have to remember one
00:09:27 this password can be much more
00:09:30 secure it can be a much
00:09:32 longer password a password not
00:09:35 necessarily more complicated because you
00:09:37 have to remember you have to
00:09:39 remember what password it is but it can be very
00:09:41 long  and if it is very long, it is more
00:09:43 difficult to create it, it is more difficult for
00:09:46 someone to guess it and for someone to
00:09:47 get access to your passwords. Also,
00:09:51 this password is not saved
00:09:53 anywhere.
00:09:54 There is no web, no server where
00:09:56 this password is saved, but  You
00:09:59 only have it here in your
00:10:01 head, of course, if you don't remember, if there comes
00:10:04 a time when you remember the
00:10:05 password,
00:10:06 then you will have lost all the
00:10:08 passwords and you will have to go reset
00:10:10 set set to reset but it is only a
00:10:14 password so it is not easy to remember
00:10:17 It is not easy to forget and for us to
00:10:19 remember what our
00:10:21 password was because there is only one
00:10:22 important password it will not work for us
00:10:26 For all the websites there are websites, perhaps such as
00:10:28 those of the bank, that ask you for a pin number,
00:10:30 a pin code, but for the majority, for
00:10:33 the vast majority of websites or
00:10:35 online services that you use, you can use
00:10:38 the password manager such as the
00:10:40 one password step and it will  Life is much
00:10:44 easier and much safer, so let
00:10:47 me know and tell me below what you think of
00:10:49 this video as an advanced level video
00:10:52 if it is your ideal if your ideal is
00:10:54 a video like this in which you use more or less
00:10:57 the same vocabulary that you would use in a
00:10:59 video  intermediate but he spoke
00:11:01 faster and spoke less articulating
00:11:04 pronouncing less clearly no or if
00:11:06 you prefer the other video the first
00:11:09 advanced level video in which he used
00:11:11 more colloquial language language more of the
00:11:13 day to day that we use between family and
00:11:15 friends okay I'll do a third
00:11:18 advanced level video that's good in the third
00:11:20 video I'll explain what's the difference and
00:11:23 why it's a slightly different concept too

00:00:00 [Music]
00:00:21 hello well yes I don't know what to sing I don't know I don't
00:00:26 know what lyrics to sing because in fact the
00:00:29 national anthem of Spain doesn't have lyrics
00:00:32 but how can it be that the
00:00:34 national anthem doesn't have lyrics well well in
00:00:37 today's video I'll tell you  Let me explain and
00:00:39 first I am going to tell you that the Spanish
00:00:41 anthem is called the royal march and the
00:00:44 royal march is a fairly
00:00:47 old melody and it is a melody that did not
00:00:51 become the national anthem because
00:00:55 someone said come on let's make a
00:00:57 new song  and come on now this is going to
00:01:00 be the national anthem it was not a melody
00:01:03 that was used more and more in
00:01:07 public events it was used in many
00:01:09 public events and it became de facto a
00:01:12 bit like an anthem for official events
00:01:15 and the royal march  It is one of the
00:01:18 oldest national signs in Europe and it is
00:01:21 known to exist
00:01:22 as early as 1761. We have documents from 1761
00:01:28 from the 18th century where the
00:01:33 melody is written. The song's score is written
00:01:35 and it seems that the composer was
00:01:38 a man named Ma.  nuel de espinoza and
00:01:41 the original name of the song was
00:01:44 cattle march or cattlemen's march, not a
00:01:47 march of people because they raise cows
00:01:50 and so on, after it
00:01:53 began to be used more and more in
00:01:55 public events, King Carlos the Third
00:01:59 declared it a march of honor  and he turned it
00:02:02 into the song that had to be played in
00:02:05 the acts in which the king appeared and
00:02:08 only in which the king appeared but a
00:02:11 few years later Isabel Segunda
00:02:14 officially declared it as the
00:02:17 national anthem as the national anthem of Spain
00:02:19 then since then since  the reign
00:02:22 of isabel the second until now well we have
00:02:25 used the same national anthem with only
00:02:28 two
00:02:29 exceptions only two holes two
00:02:32 periods of time in which it was not used
00:02:34 one was at the end of the 19th century that there was
00:02:38 a bit of instability in the government
00:02:40 and another was  at the beginning of the 20th century
00:02:43 during the second Spanish republic
00:02:46 during those years the royal march was not used
00:02:49 as the national anthem of
00:02:51 Spain either and if it does not have lyrics and it is not
00:02:55 It is common for national signs not to
00:02:57 have lyrics Most of the
00:02:59 national signs of most countries in the
00:03:01 world have lyrics In fact
00:03:04 there are only three more countries in the world that
00:03:07 have an anthem without lyrics and they are San
00:03:10 Marin or Bosnia Herzegovina and Kosovo are
00:03:13 the  three other countries that have an
00:03:15 anthem without lyrics and because it doesn't have lyrics, well,
00:03:19 the easiest way to explain it is
00:03:22 that lyrics have never been put into it, never
00:03:26 been said, okay, this is going to be the official lyrics,
00:03:28 everyone has to sing
00:03:30 these lyrics when  when the anthem sounds
00:03:33 no
00:03:34 then it is understood a little by the
00:03:37 origin it is a very old song that was
00:03:40 played it was used in public events and of
00:03:44 course the song was composed at a time
00:03:47 when in public events you had a
00:03:49 band you had a band with instruments
00:03:52 that  they had to use instruments that
00:03:55 are very loud for the whole world to
00:03:57 hear because at that time in the
00:04:00 18th century we had no electricity we
00:04:03 had no speakers we had no
00:04:05 microphones in between  once most of the
00:04:08 marches were played without a voice without a
00:04:11 person singing, then it is understood
00:04:14 that originally it did not have lyrics, that
00:04:18 does not mean that lyrics have never been
00:04:20 put on it and different people have
00:04:23 created different lyrics to sing with
00:04:26 the national anthem,
00:04:27 so for certain  acts certain
00:04:30 commemorative events throughout
00:04:32 history there have been times when it
00:04:36 has been sung in which they have put a
00:04:38 letter specifically for a
00:04:40 celebration and someone has sung
00:04:43 that letter and in addition to that there have
00:04:46 also been attempts to officially
00:04:49 put a letter to it and that  If there were
00:04:51 only that one, that lyrics that
00:04:54 everyone had to sing, it did not happen, for
00:04:56 example, in 1997, in 1997 we had
00:05:04 President Aznar, President of the
00:05:07 right-wing party government, and Aznar
00:05:10 asked several Spanish writers and poets
00:05:14 to believe together in writing one letter.
00:05:18 In a letter for the Spanish anthem
00:05:20 they tried to approve it but well
00:05:23 at that time the government of  Spain
00:05:25 was not very stable and they did not manage to
00:05:27 approve it later in 2007 the
00:05:31 Olympic Committee also suggested a letter and the
00:05:34 Olympic Committee is the organization that
00:05:37 is in charge of Spain's participation
00:05:40 in at least the Olympic Games
00:05:43 I don't know if also in other competitions
00:05:47 international athletics and such but well
00:05:49 the olympic committee suggested this letter
00:05:52 so that it would sound when the spanish the
00:05:55 spanish won some competition
00:05:59 some sport and only for those
00:06:02 sports uses so the
00:06:04 spanish olympic committee wanted to collect signatures
00:06:08 wanted to ask a lot of people to sign
00:06:09 to present  this petition before the
00:06:12 congress of spain but before they
00:06:16 presented it the lyrics were leaked someone
00:06:19 in the press some newspaper presented the
00:06:22 lyrics they showed it to the people and
00:06:25 there was quite a controversy a lot of people did
00:06:28 not like that lyrics so well in the
00:06:30 end they withdrew it  in the end they did not
00:06:32 present that proposal and the last
00:06:35 time someone tried to approve an official
00:06:37 letter  cial for the anthem of Spain
00:06:39 was in 2015 6 years ago it was also
00:06:43 tried again but it was also
00:06:46 good it has not finished approving it
00:06:49 stayed there it is not known what happened
00:06:51 the proposal was frozen and still does not have
00:06:54 an official lyrics so here  We can
00:06:58 answer the question from before in another
00:07:00 way because the Spanish national
00:07:02 anthem does not have lyrics because there has never
00:07:05 been enough will to put
00:07:09 a letter to it We have never
00:07:11 agreed on what lyrics should
00:07:13 be put to the Spanish anthem and well I have
00:07:16 read  a little these letters that they
00:07:18 tried to put that they tried to
00:07:20 approve and well I understand that many people
00:07:23 disagree because many of
00:07:25 them refer to the
00:07:28 glorious or colonial past of Spain and such
00:07:31 and many people today well they do not
00:07:34 consider that this is perhaps  something very
00:07:37 positive or something to be
00:07:39 proud of, especially young people, it is not
00:07:42 a very modern way of thinking and
00:07:44 I understand that nowadays many people to
00:07:47 many people  Would you not like to have that
00:07:49 type of lyrics in the anthem and tell me
00:07:51 if you like the national anthem
00:07:54 of your country if you like the melody and
00:07:57 if you like the lyrics or if you think I
00:08:00 would have if you would like to
00:08:03 change the lyrics would you like  change
00:08:05 some of the lyrics of your
00:08:08 country's anthem

10,"00:00:00 Is Spain racist or is it a perfect place
00:00:04 where everything is perfect and no one has ever
00:00:08 discriminated because of the color of their skin
00:00:10 or their origin watch this video to
00:00:13 find out hello well yes the time has come
00:00:23 I know that many people have
00:00:26 requested this video and well first  I
00:00:28 want to tell you that I am not an expert, I do not know
00:00:31 more than the average Spanish person on
00:00:33 the subject and today I want to talk about three
00:00:36 things. The first is my
00:00:39 general experience growing up in Spain and the things
00:00:43 that I have seen around me, not the
00:00:46 second.  They are data They are objective data
00:00:48 We are going to compare some data that
00:00:52 may be indicative of racism data
00:00:54 in Spain' and compare them with those of
00:00:56 other countries and the third we are going to see
00:01:00 and experiences that people
00:01:03 of different races and different
00:01:05 origins have had living in Spain.  let's see
00:01:08 different types of experiences and well
00:01:10 let's start with my feeling and with
00:01:13 my experiences I am a person I am
00:01:16 a person of the most common race and ethnicity
00:01:19 in Spain  Na no, we
00:01:22 consider ourselves white, we consider ourselves
00:01:24 Caucasian, although I know that in some
00:01:27 places they consider us Latinos, I don't even know
00:01:30 what that means, but well, of
00:01:34 course, I am not of a race that in
00:01:36 Spain is going to be a recipient of
00:01:39 racism that is going to be discriminated against.  Myself,
00:01:42 then my experiences of course
00:01:45 are not about receiving racism, it is more about how
00:01:48 other Spaniards act around me and
00:01:51 as he expressed, they
00:01:52 express their ideas regarding people
00:01:57 of other races of other origins who
00:02:00 live in Spain. It is also worth
00:02:02 telling you that in the video  today we are going to
00:02:05 talk about
00:02:06 in spain today today we are not going
00:02:09 to talk about racism that has happened in
00:02:12 the past in the past of spain in the
00:02:14 colonial era or whenever it was in the
00:02:17 history of spain' sure there has been a
00:02:19 lot of racism but that  We are going to leave it
00:02:22 for another video, okay then, based on my
00:02:25 own experience, I am going to explain a
00:02:28 little about the general attitude of the people and
00:02:31 then what ideas or prejudices
00:02:34 we have  For people of certain origins
00:02:38 and people who come from certain places,
00:02:40 then I believe that the attitude of the
00:02:44 majority of Spaniards, I believe that there is not
00:02:47 much racism, I believe that Spain is not
00:02:49 a very racist country, and yes, there is racism,
00:02:52 and later we will  see examples several
00:02:54 examples of racism and I think that as
00:02:57 in most places you can find
00:03:00 examples and you can find people who are
00:03:03 racist me my own my own
00:03:05 experience has been growing in a
00:03:08 part quite a lot in an area a lot of
00:03:11 progress in
00:03:12 the country in an area of ​​the country  and an area
00:03:15 of ​​my city is also quite
00:03:18 progressive and going to schools where,
00:03:21 well, I would say that the majority is progressive,
00:03:25 so it may be that my experience in
00:03:29 my life has had
00:03:32 less levels of racism
00:03:34 than the average for Spain, but well, I can
00:03:38 only speak about  me from my own
00:03:39 experience so even in this
00:03:42 situation yes I have ever had
00:03:46 experiences with people people I
00:03:48 know who have made comments
00:03:51 racist rivers that have said racist things has
00:03:54 there been someone a relative who
00:03:57 has made comments certain comments
00:04:00 about the Moors people who come
00:04:03 from North Africa not about
00:04:06 immigrants and this is a constant something
00:04:09 that we are going to see throughout this video
00:04:11 I think there are more problems with
00:04:15 foreigners with immigrants from other
00:04:18 countries
00:04:19 and it tends to be focused on hatred
00:04:22 or prejudice against people who
00:04:26 are immigrants who perhaps come from other
00:04:29 poorer countries and perhaps not so much
00:04:31 focused on race or  the color
00:04:33 of the person's skin, although of
00:04:36 course the color of the skin
00:04:38 often serves to prejudge a person
00:04:42 and to automatically put them in the
00:04:44 drawer of immigrants and assume that they are
00:04:47 poor, that they are immigrants, etc.
00:04:49 so let's talk a little about  the
00:04:52 different the different races and the
00:04:55 different origins of the immigrants
00:04:57 in that spain and the ideas we have
00:05:00 about them the largest group to
00:05:03 p  Apparently they are Romanians so yes
00:05:07 there are yes there are quite a few
00:05:09 Romanian immigrants in Spain in Romania they speak a
00:05:12 language that is quite similar
00:05:15 to Spanish to other Romance languages ​​so it
00:05:18 may be easier for them to
00:05:22 give to Spain Romanians in general are
00:05:26 perceived differently  In a rather negative way,
00:05:28 I would say that many times they are thought to be
00:05:32 good, they are associated with the idea of ​​people
00:05:35 asking for money on the street asking for
00:05:38 money on the train, taking a baby on the
00:05:41 train to ask for money, things like that, no,
00:05:43 well, yes, I would say that many
00:05:47 people have a  A slightly negative idea of
00:05:49 the Romanians, the Maghreb
00:05:52 maghey, the Maghreb is not, which is the part of Africa
00:05:56 closest to Spain, it is basically
00:05:58 Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. I would say that
00:06:02 these three countries are counted in the
00:06:04 Maghreb, and yes, the Maghreb are also
00:06:08 an immigrant group.  Quite important
00:06:11 in Spain and unfortunately the
00:06:14 Maghrebis are often associated
00:06:17 with crime, they are associated with poverty,
00:06:20 with less educated people.  to
00:06:23 find work and often
00:06:26 end up resorting to crime,
00:06:28 not organized crime or mafias, but
00:06:31 rather robbery, pickpocketing and
00:06:34 such, of course, all these ideas are all
00:06:37 prejudices and although many
00:06:40 are based on things that sometimes
00:06:44 do happen  Well, we can never judge
00:06:47 all people as criminals, for
00:06:51 example, just because they belong to the same
00:06:53 group or because they have the same
00:06:55 skin color as other people. I am not
00:06:59 just explaining the general idea that
00:07:02 the negative ideas or prejudices that
00:07:05 are often associated  With people of a
00:07:07 certain origin, then, as for the
00:07:10 North Africans, they have surely improved their
00:07:14 image. I think that many children, many
00:07:18 people younger than me, have gone to schools
00:07:21 in which their classmates
00:07:24 were North African people, and they have begun to
00:07:28 be more part of  society and I think
00:07:30 that they have surely adapted more and
00:07:33 have today perhaps a
00:07:37 less negative image of them then the
00:07:40 sub-saharans and sub-saharan immigration
00:07:43 is somewhat more recent from
00:07:46 spain sub-saharan sub-saharan
00:07:48 means from africa but from under the
00:07:50 sahara they are not people with black skin
00:07:54 until recently there were not many
00:07:56 black people in spain and this recent
00:08:00 sub-saharan immigration is when
00:08:02 there has been  Well, a certain
00:08:04 amount of black people in Spain would say
00:08:07 that in Spain we don't associate them very much
00:08:10 with crime, at least with robbery and
00:08:13 pickpocketing, and we associate them more with
00:08:16 selling things on the street with the 'top
00:08:19 blanket' and in  Spain, well, there's a lot of
00:08:21 'top manta', there's a lot of sales, well, I
00:08:25 would have to say illegal because
00:08:26 technically it's not allowed, but the
00:08:28 level at which the police persecute you
00:08:31 varies
00:08:33 varies by season depending on what you're
00:08:36 looking for, the image you want to
00:08:39 project is to that city  Well, that
00:08:43 municipality changes a bit how they deal with this,
00:08:46 but hey, the 'top blanket' is basically
00:08:49 a person who wants to
00:08:51 sell on the street on the street  In a place where you don't
00:08:54 have permission to sell, in theory you
00:08:57 couldn't sell, because they put a piece of cloth, a
00:08:59 very large piece of cloth with all the things they
00:09:02 are selling, and normally the
00:09:04 corners of that piece of cloth are tied with
00:09:07 a rope so that if the police come, well
00:09:10 you can pull the ropes
00:09:12 everything is collected in a bag and you can
00:09:15 run
00:09:15 and escape from the police so
00:09:19 I'm sure there are people who see
00:09:22 it a little negatively sometimes if they are
00:09:25 on the street there is less space to
00:09:27 walk and such  But it is not seen
00:09:31 in as negative a way as
00:09:34 the ethnic groups that are associated with
00:09:36 robbery and crime. So regarding the
00:09:40 people from China and other people from East
00:09:43 Asia, I would say that, in general, the
00:09:46 Spaniards, many Spaniards do not distinguish
00:09:49 between different countries of the  East Asia
00:09:52 and if someone has a race that is
00:09:55 slightly similar to, well, they are from
00:09:59 some East Asian country, many
00:10:01 Spaniards will think that the person is from
00:10:03 China and they will automatically assume  If the
00:10:06 person is from China,
00:10:07 then the Chinese have also been a
00:10:11 group of more recent immigration to
00:10:13 Spain in the last 10 or 15 years and the
00:10:17 Chinese in Spain have opened many
00:10:20 stores, they have opened oriental bazaars,
00:10:23 they have bought bars and take care
00:10:26 of  They've opened
00:10:29 good restaurants too, so they're
00:10:32 known above all for that reason, because they have
00:10:35 shops, I'd say that
00:10:37 we don't have specifically
00:10:40 negative ideas about the Chinese and that they're not
00:10:43 a group that's particularly discriminated against,
00:10:47 and I'd also say that it's a
00:10:49 group where their children adjust
00:10:53 quite well to society they are good
00:10:55 traditionally east
00:10:58 asian people also value education a lot
00:11:01 so i think compared to other
00:11:03 groups they adjust quite well and have
00:11:06 a relatively positive image the
00:11:10 next group is pakistanis  Yes,
00:11:13 there is a certain amount of
00:11:15 immigration from Pakistan in Spain. I have
00:11:18 seen a lot, especially especially in
00:11:20 Ba  rcelona and it may be that in big cities there are
00:11:23 usually more people from
00:11:26 pakistan we know pakistans
00:11:30 for selling beer on the street in
00:11:34 barcelona you can find them quite a lot
00:11:36 in quite a few places selling beer and
00:11:39 we know them from the country
00:11:42 in spain when we say for kiss it is not
00:11:45 something negative is not a negative word
00:11:47 and usually does not refer to
00:11:50 people from pakistan it refers to the
00:11:53 shops that are run by people from
00:11:56 pakistan the shops that have been opened by
00:11:58 people from pakistan which is normally are
00:12:01 like a mini supermarket are like a
00:12:03 mini supermarket  where they
00:12:06 have basic necessities they have
00:12:08 soap they have toothbrushes they have
00:12:11 drinks water food sometimes they
00:12:14 also have some fresh produce
00:12:16 some fruit and vegetables and the most
00:12:19 important thing about these stores is that they are
00:12:22 open until very late they can be
00:12:24 open until  11 midnight
00:12:26 until two in the morning
00:12:29 depending on the site then in
00:12:31 general  That is why Pakistanis are associated
00:12:33 with selling on the
00:12:35 street in Paris stores and they are not
00:12:39 normally associated with crime either
00:12:41 and well, we have already reached the gypsies and
00:12:45 the gypsies I already made a video only
00:12:48 of the gypsies and the
00:12:52 I really think that gypsies are the group in Spain against
00:12:54 which there is the most racism, it is a group that,
00:12:57 well, has been in Spain for many centuries and they
00:13:00 are really Spanish, they are not
00:13:03 immigrants and perhaps that is why there has also
00:13:05 been more time for people to
00:13:08 form an idea  of the gypsies a
00:13:10 negative idea against against them you can't
00:13:14 see the video of the gypsies that I made and
00:13:17 there I am more details about what type of
00:13:21 discrimination they have suffered and the reasons
00:13:24 why I think that this has happened
00:13:26 against the gypsies are really against
00:13:29 those who  I have heard more
00:13:31 negative comments living in Spain and growing up
00:13:34 in Spain we have expressions in Spanish
00:13:36 that have nothing to do with
00:13:39 gypsies or that we don't use to refer
00:13:42 to gypsies but that already f  They are part
00:13:44 of our language, not like I don't know, you're not a
00:13:48 gypsy or something like that, they are expressions that I
00:13:51 don't use that I have never liked and that
00:13:53 I would say that many
00:13:54 today are careful not to use,
00:13:57 but they have been part of our
00:13:59 language for years.  For a long time, the
00:14:02 last group that I am going to talk about is
00:14:04 the blacks of the USA, the good people who in the
00:14:09 USA would call African-Americans, not what
00:14:12 idea do we have of the blacks of the USA because
00:14:16 they are associated a lot with rap, with
00:14:19 music, with blues and such, but  Those who
00:14:22 come here, the ones we know here, are
00:14:25 tourists, so I have never heard that
00:14:29 anyone associates them with anything worse
00:14:32 than being a tourist. There are many people who
00:14:35 do not like tourists, so it's worth it,
00:14:38 just because you are a tourist, there will be
00:14:40 people who  the one that you are not going to like,
00:14:42 but because you are a tourist and you are black, I think
00:14:46 that they will simply treat you like
00:14:48 any other tourist, sometimes better and
00:14:51 sometimes worse, no, so a little
00:14:53 later in this video I am going to talk
00:14:55 about the di  difference between race and
00:14:59 country of origin because if there is a
00:15:01 difference in the way they treat you,
00:15:04 even if you are black, if they know you
00:15:07 are British or that you are American,
00:15:10 they can treat you differently than
00:15:12 if you are African, then I am going to tell you.
00:15:16 tell later in this video
00:15:17 first I am going to tell you I am going to give
00:15:20 you data I am going to give you objective data in
00:15:23 Spain there are 11% of immigrants 11%
00:15:28 of people who were born outside of Spain
00:15:33 and who came to live in Spain
00:15:36 within this  11%
00:15:38 some are foreigners others already have
00:15:41 Spanish nationality but
00:15:43 their children are not counted the children of
00:15:45 immigrants who have already been born here
00:15:48 are already Spanish so within these
00:15:51 the largest group are Romanians the
00:15:55 second are Moroccans the third
00:15:58 are  British yes yes the
00:16:01 English people the British many
00:16:05 retired people people who are older who have
00:16:08 already stopped working and receive their
00:16:11 pension from their country and well they live here
00:16:13 it costs them less money  Nero weather is better
00:16:16 and such
00:16:17 then if they are the third
00:16:19 most important immigrant group are the
00:16:21 English the fourth are the people from
00:16:24 Ecuador I didn't know there were so many people
00:16:28 from Ecuador and I forgot before
00:16:31 mentioning immigration from
00:16:33 Latin America immigration from
00:16:35 Latin America too  it is important and
00:16:39 there are also negative ideas
00:16:42 about them there are also people who
00:16:43 have negative ideas it can be a little
00:16:47 different depending on each
00:16:50 country the type of negative comments
00:16:52 I have heard is or my neighbors are from this
00:16:57 Latin American country and they throw parties
00:17:00 they  a lot of noise at night I don't know I
00:17:03 'm not sure to what extent they are
00:17:05 associated with crime I would say that in
00:17:08 general
00:17:11 people from Latin America integrate quite well yes we do
00:17:14 have specific prejudices like for
00:17:17 example people from Argentina are always
00:17:20 trying you  cheat no things
00:17:23 like that yes we have some some
00:17:25 prejudices and there are also some
00:17:27 negative words associated  I know with people
00:17:31 from Latin America, well, I'm going to
00:17:34 tell you, but don't use them, it's
00:17:37 just so you know that it's something
00:17:38 negative and that you shouldn't use it.
00:17:42 The word sudaca is sometimes used and I think that su
00:17:44 daca is the strongest word that  It can
00:17:47 be used against a person from
00:17:49 Latin America, sometimes the word panchito is used.
00:17:51 I don't know if panchito is more
00:17:54 specific for people from Mexico, but
00:17:57 well, I don't like all these words
00:17:59 and I never use them and I think it's
00:18:01 better not to use it if someone is from
00:18:03 colombia you can say colombian if you are
00:18:05 from mexico you can say mexican and that
00:18:07 's it
00:18:08 then after immigrants from
00:18:11 south america the next most
00:18:14 important group is the sub-saharan people
00:18:17 south of the sahara especially people from
00:18:21 senegal and nigeria it seems they are the
00:18:23 two most important countries  below the sahara
00:18:27 where more immigrants come from
00:18:28 so other data data from studies
00:18:32 that try to measure how racist
00:18:36 different countries are, well in this case
00:18:38 only from spain are numbers  in which they
00:18:42 have asked African immigrants
00:18:45 people who have come from Africa and they have been
00:18:48 asked if they have been stopped by the police
00:18:51 if they have been treated worse than
00:18:55 people who come from other countries and it seems
00:18:58 that half half of the people who
00:19:01 They have come from Africa They say that the
00:19:04 police have detained them at some point They
00:19:07 have detained them Not arrested They have not
00:19:09 necessarily been taken to the
00:19:11 police station But they have been stopped They have been
00:19:13 detained or interrogated about something
00:19:16 I think it is a good number
00:19:18 we should compare it  with the rest
00:19:20 of the Spaniards with the average of the
00:19:22 Spaniards but considering that
00:19:24 of these people it may be that they have
00:19:27 been in Spain for a short time, I think that half
00:19:29 seems like a high number and then
00:19:32 when they were asked if they think
00:19:36 they were treated worse  it is worse than
00:19:39 people from other countries 85% said that
00:19:43 if 85% seems like a number a fairly high number
00:19:48 is a subjective measure so it is
00:19:50 difficult to know if you compare yourself maybe to know
00:19:53 if you  they treat you better than someone from
00:19:56 latin america or asia or something but it
00:19:59 still seems like a pretty
00:20:01 high number and here are 22 studies that I
00:20:05 find most interesting in which they
00:20:07 compare data from different countries and
00:20:10 this was in a European survey they
00:20:12 asked in different  European countries
00:20:15 and they asked people from the country
00:20:19 and they would agree so they would be
00:20:21 comfortable with their son or daughter having
00:20:25 a partner from another country having a
00:20:27 partner from certain countries and certain
00:20:30 races not so here Spain almost always turned out
00:20:35 better than most others
00:20:37 countries in europe and above
00:20:39 average are less racist than
00:20:43 most other countries in europe there were only two
00:20:46 countries that were always better than
00:20:49 spain which were the uk and sweden
00:20:52 these were consistently better than
00:20:56 spain spain was always better than
00:21:00 italy and  Germany- in the majority for the
00:21:03 majority of races Spain turned out to be
00:21:07 less racist than Italy and Germany
00:21:09 so well even so the props  The sentences
00:21:12 are not extremely good either, but
00:21:15 more than half of the people in Spain
00:21:19 would have no problem with
00:21:21 their number or their son-in-law their daughter-in-law or their son-in-law
00:21:25 or their son's boyfriend or girlfriend
00:21:28 being Asian or black more
00:21:33 than half of the  people would not have a problem
00:21:35 the lowest is a Muslim only
00:21:39 50% of the people would not have a problem if
00:21:43 their son or daughter were with a
00:21:46 Muslim person so in another
00:21:48 study in which there are many countries
00:21:51 includes Spain includes the USA they also
00:21:55 asked the  If people would have a
00:21:58 problem with their neighbor, if the
00:22:01 person living in the next house or
00:22:03 on the next floor was of another race, it
00:22:06 was a person of another race of a
00:22:08 different race from theirs,
00:22:10 and this in Spain' 4.8 percent  percent, that
00:22:14 is, a little less than 5 percent do not
00:22:17 want to have people of another race
00:22:19 living as their neighbors living
00:22:23 near them in the US it is a similar number
00:22:26 in Spain
00:22:27 ' 48 percent in the US 56
00:22:32 percent good in the end  the numbers are not
00:22:35 very different it
00:22:37 seems similar to the usa so i have
00:22:41 tried looking for specific data on
00:22:44 violence i have tried looking for data on
00:22:46 violent attacks against people of
00:22:50 other races against immigrants but the
00:22:52 only data i found said
00:22:55 that in the uk- in great britain
00:22:58 england and  such there was 50 times more
00:23:02 violence than in spain and it doesn't make much
00:23:05 sense so there must be
00:23:07 very big differences in which cases are
00:23:11 counted in how the cases are counted in
00:23:14 which cases are considered to be
00:23:16 racist violence and which are not so
00:23:19 I think these data  They are not very useful.
00:23:21 I think they are not very credible and they do not
00:23:24 really allow you to compare different
00:23:27 countries. Okay, let's talk now about
00:23:30 anecdotes of experiences that
00:23:34 people living in Spain have had. So,
00:23:37 an interesting comment that I find
00:23:40 interesting is from this girl, this girl.
00:23:43 she is a girl from the usa she is a black girl
00:23:46 who has published several videos on
00:23:48 youtube and in her video you  I put
00:23:51 a link to her ballet video below in the description,
00:23:53 in the video she mentions that in
00:23:57 Spain boys don't pay attention to the
00:24:02 race of the girls when they decide to
00:24:05 ask a girl to go out with
00:24:07 her to be boyfriends and so she says
00:24:10 they pay less attention to race than people from the
00:24:13 usa, for example, she in the usa has
00:24:17 heard a lot about me, it's only something with
00:24:20 whites, it's me, it's only something with
00:24:22 blacks, and she says that in spain she has
00:24:25 had a different
00:24:27 experience, another experience that came out in the news
00:24:30 I've been looking for it for a long time and I haven't
00:24:34 found it. I'm sorry but I
00:24:35 couldn't find the origin of this
00:24:37 news. I remember reading
00:24:39 it a few years ago
00:24:40 but I couldn't find it so I
00:24:43 don't have a reference but I explained
00:24:45 what happened to a guy  In Barcelona, ​​a
00:24:48 black-skinned boy was arrested by the
00:24:51 police. The police stopped him and I think
00:24:54 that a boy who was with other people
00:24:55 was with friends and the police stopped him
00:24:57 because they thought they thought they were
00:24:59 they thought it was a thief or a
00:25:02 pickpocket or something until they
00:25:04 realized that the boy was not African that
00:25:07 boy was English he was a boy with
00:25:09 black skin but English and the
00:25:12 moment the police realized that he was
00:25:14 English they  He wasn't African,
00:25:16 the way they dealt with
00:25:18 him totally changed. No, well, maybe this gives you a
00:25:23 little more idea of ​​to what extent
00:25:26 there is a problem with race in Spain and
00:25:29 to what extent there is a problem with
00:25:31 xenophobia, no, and none of the  Two good things:
00:25:34 racism is not good and
00:25:36 xenophobia is not good, but maybe we can
00:25:39 understand a little better what is the origin
00:25:42 of this problem, so
00:25:44 I found another guy on YouTube
00:25:47 who mentions a similar experience.
00:25:49 I'll also put the link to his video below.
00:25:52 And this boy is of
00:25:55 Latin American descent, he is from the United States, but his
00:25:58 parents or grandparents were
00:26:00 Latin American, and he is dark-skinned. His
00:26:03 skin is a little darker than
00:26:05 that of the most common skin color.  He is currently
00:26:09 in Spain and says that sometimes they have
00:26:11 treated him badly but when people
00:26:14 realize that he is from the US and that he is not an
00:26:17 immigrant from Latin America then
00:26:20 suddenly they treat him much better and are very
00:26:23 friendly and want to become his friends and the
00:26:25 same when  He goes to stores and such when
00:26:28 they realize that he is from the US and that he is a
00:26:30 tourist who is not an immigrant, suddenly
00:26:34 they treat him in a totally different way
00:26:36 so I have been watching many
00:26:39 videos on YouTube of the experiences
00:26:41 that most people have had in Spain
00:26:43 They comment that they have not had
00:26:45 any cases of open racism, not
00:26:49 since people told them not to be black or go
00:26:52 to your country
00:26:53 and things like that, but many people
00:26:56 comment that once or twice they have gone to
00:27:00 a store and have realized that
00:27:03 the cashier or that a store employee
00:27:05 was following him with his eyes, paying attention
00:27:08 all the time to what they were
00:27:10 doing specifically, a black girl from the
00:27:13 USA was also in Spain for two years
00:27:17 and in her video she commented that  this happened to
00:27:20 him once in two years he was here
00:27:22 only once it happened to him that he went to a
00:27:25 store and was trying on clothes and then he
00:27:29 returned the clothes to where he had taken them
00:27:31 but the worker the
00:27:35 store employee did not see that he returned the  clothes
00:27:38 and it was thought that she had stolen them and then they
00:27:41 searched her and she saw that she had not stolen
00:27:43 anything and that's it there was no
00:27:46 more problem but hey it could be a case of
00:27:49 racism and this girl commented that in
00:27:52 Spain in two years it happened to her once but
00:27:55 that  living in the usa it
00:27:59 happened more often
00:28:00 i'm not sure what state in the usa he
00:28:02 lived in and i know that in different states
00:28:05 there are also very different levels of
00:28:07 racism okay then if in spain there are
00:28:10 cases of racism and there are racist people
00:28:13 and there have also been cases  in which the
00:28:16 police have used violence when it
00:28:19 was not necessary, there have been cases of
00:28:22 police officers who have also been recorded
00:28:24 saying racist insults that I think
00:28:28 this is because what time we are in what
00:28:31 year we are because t  This has to happen
00:28:33 even later there have been cases of
00:28:35 insults to footballers in a football match
00:28:39 that there is a footballer who is of
00:28:41 another race and the fans the fans from
00:28:44 the stands shouting racist insults not to
00:28:47 see the fans are horrible the
00:28:49 football fans in  In general, they are
00:28:52 horrible, so I am not surprised that they
00:28:55 do such a horrible thing, but,
00:28:58 well, it is also something that is good that
00:29:01 we should prevent it from happening. Apart
00:29:05 from that, in terms of xenophobia,
00:29:06 in terms of fear of hatred of
00:29:09 immigrants, well, like many
00:29:11 others.  countries there are political parties that
00:29:14 take advantage of this they take advantage of
00:29:16 this hatred that try to fuel this hatred
00:29:19 and base their political campaign on
00:29:22 fear of immigrants no and this
00:29:25 also seems to me something quite
00:29:27 sad so if looking for resources and
00:29:31 documenting myself for this video I have
00:29:33 I have found many cases of racism I have
00:29:36 met many people who have
00:29:38 had a bad experience in Spain
00:29:41 but then  I found a video for a
00:29:44 television program there were two actors
00:29:46 who acted out a scene they were at a
00:29:49 bus stop and a boy is a
00:29:52 boy who has been adopted he grew up in
00:29:55 spain' he was adopted by
00:29:57 spanish parents but he was born in venezuela and
00:30:01 well he is from  quite dark skin
00:30:04 so this boy and a white man
00:30:08 acted in a racist scene
00:30:11 in which the white
00:30:13 man said racist things to the boy and they
00:30:16 wanted to see how people reacted not
00:30:19 so I'll also leave the link
00:30:23 for the video below but this  good video for
00:30:26 me it was very emotional because all the
00:30:29 women who were at the
00:30:32 bus station jump to protect the boy to
00:30:36 protect the dark-skinned boy and good to
00:30:39 see something like that it gave me a
00:30:42 lot of hope it did not give me much
00:30:43 hope for by  our society
00:30:45 because even women who
00:30:49 could easily shut up could easily
00:30:52 be afraid of a man bigger and
00:30:54 stronger than them as they rush to
00:30:57 protect the boy at the  boy of another race
00:31:01 and well you can see the video that I think
00:31:03 is also something I don't know it made me
00:31:05 cry a little so but but well it
00:31:07 was something that gives me a little bit of
00:31:09 optimism
00:31:11 and if racism is something very  sad that
00:31:14 someone is prejudiced against you or that
00:31:16 you have fewer opportunities simply
00:31:19 because of your DNA because of the DNA that your parents
00:31:22 gave you that sometimes is not related
00:31:24 to the culture in which you grew up or
00:31:27 to the values ​​you have or to the
00:31:31 things you have  you have done in your life, which is
00:31:33 the only thing someone should be
00:31:36 able to judge you for, no, and if not, I think we are
00:31:39 a very racist country, but it is clear that
00:31:42 the situation could be improved and I hope
00:31:45 that at least in this video
00:31:48 you have understood  a little more about the
00:31:51 situation in Spain to what extent is
00:31:54 racism a factor and to what extent
00:31:56 is xenophobia a factor and below in the
00:32:00 description
00:32:00 I leave links to the videos of other
00:32:03 youtubers that I have mentioned where they
00:32:06 explain their experiences and  tell me in
00:32:09 the comments
00:32:10 what it's like in your country if you think your country
00:32:13 is racist that there are many
00:32:15 cases of racism
00:32:17 okay come on goodbye

19,"00:00:01 Today I'm going to talk about digital nomads
00:00:03 and I'm going to talk about whether they're
00:00:05 good or bad
00:00:09 [Music]
00:00:13 good, well, digital nomads,
00:00:17 well, first I'm going to start by saying that
00:00:19 I don't exactly consider myself a
00:00:22 digital nomad,
00:00:22 so I'm not necessarily saying that
00:00:25 this  go with me no
00:00:27 but
00:00:29 but well I guess in certain
00:00:31 ways or a squirrel because
00:00:34 well I'm not a nomad in the sense that
00:00:36 I don't move I'm not going to live yet from one
00:00:38 country to another and such
00:00:40 but digital well yes I am digital so
00:00:43 I work  on the internet and yes, in a
00:00:46 certain sense, my situation is a
00:00:47 bit similar to that of some digital nomads
00:00:51 and lately I have read some articles
00:00:53 on the internet and such that they
00:00:56 complain about digital nomads and
00:00:58 talk about the problems of having
00:01:01 nomads  digital and in this video, well,
00:01:04 I'm going to do a bit of a counterpoint to that,
00:01:06 I'm going to, above all, I'm going to argue that
00:01:08 honestly, well, most of the things
00:01:11 that digital nomads imply are
00:01:14 good and positive things for the country
00:01:17 where they live no even though
00:01:19 well legally they are not always in a
00:01:22 situation exactly
00:01:25 clearly clearly legal no then
00:01:28 the first phenomenon of digital nomads
00:01:31 well I guess you know what
00:01:33 digital nomads are they are not
00:01:35 people who  They work online, they
00:01:38 earn money, doing work
00:01:39 online, be it programming or
00:01:42 translation or marketing or whatever, and
00:01:45 they live in another country, they live in other
00:01:48 places, normally the most common thing is to
00:01:50 live in a place where it is cheaper,
00:01:53 where the  standard of living is more, it costs
00:01:56 less money, so with your
00:01:58 salary, you can afford to go
00:02:00 out to eat more, you can
00:02:03 afford a bigger apartment or a
00:02:06 bigger house or with a pool or whatever, well,
00:02:07 have a better level  of life no
00:02:10 or simply spend less money and
00:02:12 save save more money what happens because
00:02:15 I have read comments about the impact on
00:02:18 the local economy on the economy of the
00:02:21 place do  where you are living well, that
00:02:25 is, what an impact of course you are earning
00:02:28 money abroad earning money
00:02:30 from another country and all the money you spend
00:02:33 on a day-to-day basis everything you have what you
00:02:35 spend to live all the money for
00:02:37 food transportation from  rent you
00:02:40 are injecting into the local economy
00:02:43 you are bringing money into
00:02:47 the country you are bringing money all the
00:02:49 money you spend you are bringing in from
00:02:51 outside or the consequence of
00:02:54 that is that well that in general would have
00:02:57 to be very good for the country  Not only
00:03:00 are you like a tourist because tourism
00:03:02 already brings money, but you're
00:03:05 there more time for gas, an
00:03:07 oyster rental would have to be something quite
00:03:09 good for the country
00:03:12 and well, later in the video
00:03:14 I'm going to explain why  I think that more
00:03:15 countries would have to
00:03:17 promote more
00:03:20 digital nomads. A problem with that, a problem
00:03:22 with bringing money and spending money in the
00:03:25 local economy, is not gentrification.
00:03:28 gentrification is not a problem of
00:03:30 bringing money and giving money to the
00:03:32 locals, it is that everything happens in a
00:03:36 very concentrated area, that there is a
00:03:38 very large concentration of rich
00:03:41 people, of people who are willing to pay more
00:03:42 to pay more money in a space
00:03:45 reduced, then if there are certain
00:03:48 cities, certain destinations where there is
00:03:51 an influx of digital nomads
00:03:55 who buy many apartments who go a lot
00:04:00 to expensive restaurants and such, that can
00:04:02 contribute to the fact that local people, the people
00:04:04 who live in that place cannot
00:04:06 afford to rent, have to
00:04:08 to move than to go live somewhere
00:04:11 further from their work or not and
00:04:13 also that there are no more places because
00:04:16 affordable restaurants and stores
00:04:19 stores that they can afford
00:04:22 can no longer exist there because there
00:04:25 are more people there who want to spend more
00:04:28 money  and that she is willing to pay
00:04:30 more expensive things and therefore the
00:04:32 rent of the premises the rent of
00:04:34 the stores rises and only stores that
00:04:36 sell expensive things  they can afford to
00:04:38 be there not to be in that place
00:04:42 and I don't know how much of a problem it is I don't know
00:04:45 if it's a problem that happens in many
00:04:47 places but hey if it happens and if it's
00:04:49 happening because of digital nomads well
00:04:51 I fully
00:04:54 agree  that the government do something
00:04:55 to make sure that they are spread out
00:04:59 that there are enough
00:05:01 attractive places or that they somehow
00:05:03 control the supply of flats for rent
00:05:07 and such to make sure that these
00:05:09 digital nomads are
00:05:11 spread out enough not that they
00:05:13 are mixed with the  local population
00:05:16 that there is not a very large concentration
00:05:18 of a place that means that the
00:05:20 locals can no longer live in that neighborhood or
00:05:22 cannot live in this city a bit
00:05:24 like what is happening in Barcelona-
00:05:26 with tourism but apart from that or
00:05:29 Whether that is controlled if you are careful
00:05:33 with that, because the fact that someone
00:05:35 is spending money in the
00:05:36 local economy means that there will be more
00:05:38 jobs for them.  to local people who will be
00:05:40 able to have higher salaries in general
00:05:43 I think it is a very good thing there are people
00:05:45 who complain that the digital nomads
00:05:48 are paying taxes they are not paying
00:05:50 local taxes let's see not that they are not
00:05:54 paying taxes of course some
00:05:56 They pay taxes they pay
00:05:59 VAT taxes
00:06:02 they have to pay the sales tax because they are
00:06:03 buying things if the rent
00:06:05 has gone well they are also paying
00:06:07 through the rent but it is
00:06:09 true that they do not pay money in the country
00:06:12 for the income they are  getting no
00:06:14 and the population of that country, well,
00:06:16 due to the income they obtain, they
00:06:18 would also have to be paying
00:06:20 taxes, what happens that digital nomads don't do that
00:06:25 because they want to, it's not
00:06:28 that they don't pay taxes locally
00:06:29 because they don't want to, it's not that they don't pay  in
00:06:31 the country where they are living because they don't
00:06:33 want to, it's because they don't normally
00:06:36 have a legal way to do it if
00:06:38 you're there for a while if you're in  one if you are
00:06:40 living in a country for a few months
00:06:43 you do not have fiscal residence in that country
00:06:46 legally you cannot work in that
00:06:49 country if you are with a tourist visa or
00:06:51 you are without a visa legally you cannot
00:06:54 work therefore legally you
00:06:56 cannot pay taxes as if you
00:06:57 were working  and I believe that the
00:07:01 majority and what I have read is that the
00:07:03 majority of digital nomads
00:07:05 would be happy to pay
00:07:07 taxes where they live, not to pay in their
00:07:09 country and in the place where they live or if
00:07:11 instead of paying in their country well  paying
00:07:13 them where they live most
00:07:15 people wouldn't care what happens that
00:07:18 's something digital nomads themselves
00:07:19 can't do anything it has to be the
00:07:21 government the government of the country that
00:07:24 offers some way for those
00:07:26 digital nomads well  are paying
00:07:28 taxes there
00:07:31 and with this we come to the visas to the
00:07:34 types of visas because I think that something very
00:07:36 good that countries could do is a
00:07:39 digital nomad visa, a visa
00:07:41 that  it allows you to work in the country for three
00:07:44 months or six months or a year or whatever
00:07:47 and pay taxes in the country pay
00:07:49 income taxes on the money
00:07:51 you are spending in that country and I
00:07:53 think that would equate the
00:07:56 digital nomad to a person who  He
00:07:57 is simply working in this country and he
00:08:01 is not taking any work from the
00:08:03 people of the country because the work he
00:08:05 is doing could be done by anyone,
00:08:07 he is doing it online so
00:08:11 anyone else who can do what he can has the same access
00:08:13 make him that digital nomad person
00:08:15 would be working for the same
00:08:17 clients and earning the same money if he
00:08:20 lived in another country, therefore it is
00:08:23 in the best interest of many countries to
00:08:26 attract that person that person goes
00:08:28 to his country and is paying taxes and
00:08:31 even if he does not  pay taxes is the truth is
00:08:34 in the best interest of the country that
00:08:35 person is spending their money there
00:08:39 then especially for countries
00:08:44 that are less developed  The countries
00:08:46 where the economy is not working
00:08:48 very well or simply are not yet
00:08:52 so developed countries where the standard
00:08:54 of living is cheaper well they are interested
00:08:57 I think they are very interested in attracting
00:08:59 those digital nomads so that there are more
00:09:01 people there spending money not really
00:09:04 the  The only ones for whom you could say
00:09:06 that this situation is not fair is for
00:09:09 the developed countries for the
00:09:12 expensive countries for the countries where there is money
00:09:15 because many of these people
00:09:19 many of these companies that pay
00:09:20 money to digital nomads are in
00:09:23 developed countries in countries  rich
00:09:25 but of course, that is, the only reason
00:09:28 why this would not be fair to developed countries
00:09:31 is that more money is earned
00:09:34 in those countries, but I think it would be very
00:09:36 difficult to argue that it is fair that
00:09:40 these countries earn more in general, I
00:09:43 do not think that  not many people would argue that
00:09:45 so it's hard to see any
00:09:49 downside to the fact
00:09:53 that people are making money  from
00:09:55 rich countries and spending it in poor countries or
00:09:58 in countries where there is less money where it
00:10:00 costs less money to live and of course the
00:10:03 digital nomad visa so
00:10:06 far there are not many places
00:10:08 I suppose because also countries where
00:10:10 people normally go to live well  They have
00:10:14 other problems and I was
00:10:17 specifically reading the case of Indonesia but in
00:10:20 Thailand it is also a bit
00:10:21 similar there are also many
00:10:23 digital nomads who come here to live and
00:10:24 work here
00:10:26 but maybe it is not very urgent for the
00:10:30 government to do that no maybe they have other
00:10:33 problems  and other things that perhaps
00:10:35 have to be dealt with before this but there
00:10:38 are already at least a couple of countries that I have
00:10:41 read that have or have a
00:10:48 specific visa for digital nomads that
00:10:50 are Estonia and Costa Rica I think it is
00:10:54 and I think many  Countries could
00:10:56 benefit from having this type of
00:10:57 visa, what happens when they do not offer
00:11:02 this type of visa, because digital nomads
00:11:04 They are looking for another way to be able to
00:11:07 live in the country, not either without a visa
00:11:10 or with a tourist visa and when it runs
00:11:13 out, well, leaving and re-
00:11:15 entering the country or with some type of student visa,
00:11:18 studying
00:11:21 the language of the country.  country, for example, but
00:11:23 many times not enrolled
00:11:25 in school, paying for school, but
00:11:27 they are not really studying seriously,
00:11:29 some do not even go to class, not to
00:11:31 study the language, so it
00:11:34 is true that in terms of legal situation,
00:11:37 it is not  In a bit of a
00:11:40 gray area, no, why,
00:11:42 for example, now I am also
00:11:44 in Thailand, it is because Thailand
00:11:46 allows it and because Thailand has
00:11:48 accepted me and nothing or visas is a tourist visa,
00:11:50 but they have not set a
00:11:53 clear limit to how much.  time you can
00:11:55 spend in the country if they did like europe
00:11:57 and said okay you can only stay
00:11:59 three months well thailand could do it
00:12:01 if you wanted you could do that
00:12:03 you could tell you no you are three months in the
00:12:06 country  then you have to leave and you can't
00:12:08 be there for three months you can't
00:12:09 go back in they could do it if they
00:12:11 wanted to but but they don't they decide
00:12:13 not to do it
00:12:15 I've also read arguments that say oh
00:12:18 but it's very difficult for a foreigner
00:12:20 to get a visa to go to
00:12:23 europe to go to the usa to go to a
00:12:25 rich country and for us it is very easy it
00:12:29 was a poor country without a visa even going
00:12:32 to a country where there is less
00:12:34 money
00:12:36 is true and it has nothing to do with
00:12:38 digital nomads for tourism it
00:12:41 is  the same and I do not agree
00:12:44 that it is difficult to get a
00:12:47 visa or even that there are visas, that
00:12:48 is, I would throw away all the borders for myself,
00:12:50 but it has nothing to do with
00:12:54 what,
00:12:56 even if I am a digital nomad, that is, it is
00:12:58 exactly  the same to be for
00:13:01 tourism or to go to work in another country
00:13:03 you are going to find exactly the
00:13:05 same problems
00:13:08 but not only that, that is, by going to work
00:13:11 to be a digital standard in another country in
00:13:15 the case  or that there is not the problem
00:13:17 of gentrification that they are
00:13:18 really concentrated all the
00:13:21 consequences are positive for the country
00:13:24 I do not see when that is an abuse
00:13:27 you are abusing
00:13:28 you are abusing in a way that
00:13:31 a tourist would not also do
00:13:32 any tourist going to the country no you
00:13:35 could not say the same about them no
00:13:37 yes it is true touring
00:13:39 thailand is much cheaper than
00:13:40 touring iceland but that does not
00:13:43 mean that people who come here to
00:13:44 do tourism spend their money  here
00:13:46 this year is doing something negative
00:13:49 for the country some do
00:13:51 negative things because they are bad people because they
00:13:54 are stupid and they do and because they really
00:13:57 cause problems but that at no
00:14:01 time have I heard that digital nomads
00:14:02 cause more problems for
00:14:05 example than tourists who tend well
00:14:06 to get too drunk and in general
00:14:09 to not know the culture of the country
00:14:11 as much as someone who lives here someone who
00:14:13 is here for 1
00:14:14 and has more  Well, time to really
00:14:16 integrate and get to know the culture of the country,
00:14:19 but well, I think that
00:14:21 the subject has gone down enough. Tell me, what do you
00:14:25 think, what opinion do you have about
00:14:27 digital nomads? I think it is something that
00:14:30 will happen more and more in the future,
00:14:31 we will see  that there are more and more people
00:14:35 who become digital nomads because
00:14:38 there are more and more jobs that can be
00:14:40 done online no and tell me what
00:14:42 you think to tell me if you think it's a
00:14:44 positive trend or if you think it has
00:14:48 negative things it's also okay come alone

21,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about a case
00:00:02 of gang rape that has
00:00:05 had and is having a very
00:00:07 big impact in Spain. Hello, good, yes
00:00:17 , today's story is not very, very
00:00:19 funny, it is something quite serious, but it is
00:00:22 something that has been  part of the news
00:00:24 in Spain in recent years and that it has
00:00:27 been a very important event and that it
00:00:29 has brought many, many people to
00:00:32 have very strong opinions
00:00:34 about this and the truth is that, well, it has
00:00:36 been a pretty horrible case that
00:00:39 happened in  2016
00:00:42 and I don't know if you've heard it, it's the case of
00:00:45 the pack, it's known a lot about it by the
00:00:47 pack,
00:00:49 and it's a case of a rape of
00:00:51 a girl, an 18-year-old girl, by a group
00:00:54 of five men, and that happened in 2016 and it happened.
00:01:00 It is known as the case of the pack because
00:01:02 these five friends with others with other
00:01:06 boys who had a WhatsApp
00:01:09 group a group a common conversation on
00:01:11 WhatsApp and the group was called the pack
00:01:14 just like a pack of wolves for
00:01:16 example so good now  You can
00:01:18 imagine where the shots are going
00:01:20 so now last June last month
00:01:22 the trial ended the trial ended
00:01:25 and that is why now
00:01:29 the whole story can be explained I can explain to you what
00:01:31 happened then it happened in Pamplona at
00:01:34 the San Fermin fairs I think  That
00:01:37 the Sanfermines has already been mentioned before
00:01:39 because there is the famous bullfight
00:01:41 where people run because down below they are
00:01:43 chased by the bulls because it was during
00:01:45 these during these festivities during the
00:01:48 Sanfermines in Pamplona in the town
00:01:51 where they do it and they violated a
00:01:53 18-year-old girl, a girl, well, quite
00:01:56 young, who was not a minor, but well,
00:01:57 quite young, and that was five friends,
00:02:00 and among the five friends there was one who
00:02:03 was a civil guard, a civil guard is a
00:02:05 police force, a type of police officer from
00:02:08 Spain, one who was a guard  civilian and another
00:02:10 who was a soldier who was a soldier
00:02:13 so the five boys were walking
00:02:15 down the street with the girl they put her in
00:02:18 a doorway a doorway is the space that
00:02:20 In a block of flats, there is a space in
00:02:23 front of the door of the house
00:02:25 when there is a certain space where
00:02:27 you can enter, so as not to get wet and such, well,
00:02:29 it is a doorway and they put the girl
00:02:31 in the doorway, the five of them
00:02:35 raped her, well  in the mouth vaginally and
00:02:38 anally also not only that but they
00:02:41 also recorded it they recorded it all with
00:02:44 their cell phones they recorded seven videos with
00:02:46 their cell phones and not only that but
00:02:49 when they had finished they stole
00:02:52 the girl's cell phone the cell phone was
00:02:55 already stolen  You will tell me, I don't know if it was so that the
00:02:57 girl could not notify, she could not say
00:02:59 anything, but well, that seems and well,
00:03:03 this case immediately appeared in the
00:03:05 news, it appeared on all the channels and
00:03:08 also because it was shared a lot on
00:03:11 social networks because it was a case
00:03:13 Horrible and there are a lot of people, well, they
00:03:15 were very shocked to begin with, a
00:03:18 lot of people, well, they had a pretty
00:03:21 strong show and a lot of people were pretty
00:03:24 angry, so what happened, did they
00:03:28 judge the facts?  The events were
00:03:30 judged in a court in Navarra,
00:03:33 Navarra is where Pamplona is located,
00:03:37 and in a couple of courts there they judged him
00:03:40 and said that there had been no
00:03:44 sexual assault. Sexual assault is in the
00:03:47 Spanish penal code, in Spanish law, it is the
00:03:49 name it receives.  a rape what we
00:03:51 would normally say a rape because
00:03:53 the court said that it had not been
00:03:55 rape it had not been sexual assault it
00:03:57 had only been abuse
00:04:00 sexual abuse because for it to be a sexual assault there
00:04:04 must be violence and intimidation
00:04:08 if there is only violence nothing happens
00:04:11 if  There is only intimidation, they only
00:04:13 scare the girl, they make her afraid
00:04:15 to have sex with her, well, nothing happens,
00:04:17 there has to be violence and
00:04:19 intimidation, so
00:04:23 they put them in
00:04:25 jail for nine years, of course,
00:04:28 immediately people understood  that the
00:04:31 judge had said the court had said
00:04:33 that there had been no rape and there were
00:04:36 therefore many demonstrations  Many
00:04:39 people in Spain spoke out about how it could
00:04:42 be that they did not consider this
00:04:44 a rape when clearly a group
00:04:47 of 5 or boys
00:04:49 much bigger than the girl with much
00:04:51 more strength is necessarily because there
00:04:54 was
00:04:55 not necessarily but also the
00:04:57 videos, well they indicated that  there was
00:04:59 clearly intimidation because there
00:05:01 were many many demonstrations the
00:05:04 government said that it was going to start
00:05:06 changing the law and it is going to start preparing
00:05:08 another law to change it so that it would
00:05:10 be clearer so both the
00:05:13 prosecution and the defense appealed the
00:05:16 sentence when it appeals it is a
00:05:17 sentence does
00:05:20 this case well, it should be taken to another court,
00:05:22 normally a higher court with more
00:05:24 power, and that the facts be looked at again,
00:05:27 and that a new
00:05:28 sentence be made, not then, while
00:05:31 the new trial was taking place, they
00:05:33 were released if they were a  a whole year free
00:05:36 that they did not have to be in jail and of
00:05:38 course, many people were also
00:05:39 surprised by that or  how can
00:05:41 you say that five boys who have done
00:05:44 this are not going to commit crimes
00:05:46 again
00:05:49 and well they were, well, one year
00:05:51 free they were free but they
00:05:53 were on probation and
00:05:56 some of the  conditions were that they
00:05:58 had to hand over their passport they
00:06:01 could not have a passport and they were
00:06:03 prohibited from leaving the country that happened
00:06:06 three days three days after
00:06:08 leaving jail one of them went to the police
00:06:11 to
00:06:12 renew his passport they caught him trying to
00:06:15 renew his passport and he  He said no no
00:06:17 no I didn't want to leave the country I didn't want to
00:06:19 run away but well and another other boy from the
00:06:22 group that year who was out on bail
00:06:27 tried to steal some sunglasses
00:06:30 somewhere in a town he stole some
00:06:32 sunglasses and  they discovered him they
00:06:34 caught him stealing there were two
00:06:38 security guards who were chasing him and
00:06:40 the guy with his car ran over them with the
00:06:43 car trying to escape from the
00:06:44 security guards he ran over them  with
00:06:47 the car, that is, imagine what a group and
00:06:50 well, during that year the case went to the tri
00:06:53 to the supreme court the supreme court
00:06:56 is the court they are the highest judges
00:06:59 of the system d
00:07:01 of the Spanish legal system before the
00:07:04 constitutional court but the constitutional court
00:07:09 only  it comes to the
00:07:10 constitutional court to discuss laws to see
00:07:13 if there is any law whether a law is
00:07:15 valid or not valid but I think that
00:07:18 for most cases the supreme court
00:07:21 if the supreme court is the highest
00:07:24 where you get to and the supreme court itself
00:07:26 who said that it had been a
00:07:28 sexual assault, yes, by majority the judges
00:07:31 voted that it had been a
00:07:32 sexual assault and each of
00:07:37 the members of the group received
00:07:38 15 years from a 15-year sentence. In practice, the
00:07:42 sentences can be shorter for good reasons.
00:07:46 behavior and then when there is little left
00:07:50 to finish the sentence, they allow you to
00:07:52 go home on weekends or go
00:07:57 to prison only at night, things
00:08:00 like that, but well  the sentences are 15
00:08:02 years, which are more than the
00:08:05 original sentence for sexual abuse and well, that has
00:08:09 been a case that has brought a lot of
00:08:11 discussion on television and in social networks
00:08:13 at various points for various
00:08:16 things that, well, many people have
00:08:18 considered to be  they had to change
00:08:20 that there would have to be better
00:08:22 protection for cases like this for cases of
00:08:25 rape and as I have told you it
00:08:26 even led the government to say
00:08:29 that they were going to change the laws
00:08:32 that they were preparing a new law no
00:08:34 and well now  It is simply to tell you about
00:08:36 a very notorious case like this that has
00:08:38 occurred in Spain that if you come to Spain,
00:08:40 if you have friends here or if you live here,
00:08:43 not here, get on in Spain, it may be
00:08:47 that you have heard of this case and
00:08:49 thus you will know a little more about  what's up
00:08:52 what happened
00:08:53 okay come see you later
00:08:59 [Music]
00:09:01 and
00:09:02 [Music]

00:00:05 well, today I come to talk to you
00:00:12 about Madrid,
00:00:14 as you already know, I'm from Madrid, this is how it is
00:00:20 in Madrid,
00:00:22 I grew up in Madrid and I live in Madrid,
00:00:29 well, first of all,
00:00:35 I'm going to put a little more emphasis on
00:00:36 this from Madrid
00:00:38 because there are different theories.  There are theories
00:00:41 that say that by the mere fact
00:00:44 of being born in Madrid, you are already from
00:00:47 Madrid. In addition, there is another
00:00:50 term that is very,
00:00:54 like saying,
00:00:56 very traditional. In fact, when you
00:00:59 say if I am from Madrid, I am from Madrid, there are
00:01:02 many people who will  ask
00:01:03 quickly, are you a cat, well, we all know
00:01:07 what a cat is, an
00:01:10 animal, I remember the first time they told me,
00:01:14 and you're a cat, and I said,
00:01:17 well,
00:01:20 well, well, what does it mean to be a cat or to be a
00:01:23 cat, to
00:01:25 be a cat or to be a cat, it means that you are
00:01:29 native, that you are  Originally from Madrid,
00:01:32 but it is not enough that you were
00:01:35 born, grew up, and
00:01:38 lived in Madrid to be able to consider yourself a
00:01:41 cat or cat, it is necessary that three
00:01:45 more generations than you have been born,
00:01:49 grown, and lived.  in madrid
00:01:54 and why cat cat and they didn't come down
00:02:00 lion lioness it's okay because cat or cat well
00:02:05 all this goes back to
00:02:08 historical issues well at a time
00:02:13 when the capital of
00:02:16 spain was
00:02:18 was toledo because madrid was much much
00:02:20 later
00:02:22 and at that time when  the capital
00:02:24 was toledo spain the entire
00:02:26 iberian peninsula had been invaded by the
00:02:30 arabs by the muslims
00:02:33 ok so you guys think ok a
00:02:37 long long long time ago in a
00:02:40 walled city ok with walls
00:02:43 everywhere a city where the
00:02:46 spanish no longer had  power because the
00:02:50 Arabs the Muslims had arrived and
00:02:53 had conquered the city, it is worth
00:02:55 starting a little in that context, well,
00:02:57 in this context there was
00:03:00 a kid, a boy, a young man, a Spanish boy
00:03:04 who tried to
00:03:07 [Music
00:03:09 ] to try to conquer
00:03:13 Spanish territory again  so that he could
00:03:15 do the Spanish again and to
00:03:20 help his people to his Spanish people it
00:03:25 turns out that this boy was very agile and
00:03:27 He had a lot of facility to climb trees
00:03:31 to move very well and very quickly, it
00:03:35 turns out that this boy decided to
00:03:38 help his nation to the Spanish people, he
00:03:41 decided to climb
00:03:44 the wall of the wall, he decided to climb
00:03:47 the wall from below, the people who
00:03:50 watched
00:03:52 said that it resembled a  a cat is worth that
00:03:56 much from there because now when
00:04:01 you say you are from Madrid he
00:04:03 will immediately ask you are you a cat
00:04:06 from there because of that story of that
00:04:09 fast agile boy of movement it is
00:04:12 worth helping and having and
00:04:15 conquering Spain again rather than
00:04:19 conquering the city of Toledo again  At that
00:04:20 time I think it was Toledo and the truth is
00:04:22 that the story is a bit rusty
00:04:24 but I think it was Toledo, in any
00:04:27 case, in order to regain power,
00:04:31 the people of Spain that boy decided to
00:04:34 climb the wall of the
00:04:39 wall and  seizing power in this way, in
00:04:41 fact, he succeeded and from
00:04:43 then on the story continues Spain
00:04:46 the reconquest took place
00:04:48 theoretically it is worth this and  It's an
00:04:51 urban legend that is very possible
00:04:52 too but good from here so you
00:04:55 know where it comes from to be a cat or a cat,
00:04:58 well, well, I'm not a cat myself
00:05:02 and in Madrid but my parents are
00:05:06 one yes and the other is not my mother if she is from
00:05:09 Madrid my father is not  Therefore,
00:05:11 no, because my grandparents are not from
00:05:13 Madrid either, so I am not
00:05:15 as good as I have been saying. I come
00:05:18 to talk a little more about Madrid, well,
00:05:20 Madrid, the capital of Spain, Madrid, the
00:05:24 land and the city of Chotis Chotis,
00:05:28 you know what Chotis is, well.  one
00:05:31 of the most typical dances in the city
00:05:34 of madrid'
00:05:37 is very fun I remember when I
00:05:39 was at school and they made us
00:05:42 dress up because well all this chotis
00:05:45 is associated
00:05:47 with a celebration of a party that takes
00:05:50 place on May 15 in the city of
00:05:52 Madrid is the festival of San Isidro, one of
00:05:55 the
00:05:57 most important patrons and figures of the city
00:05:59 of Madrid, it is also associated with
00:06:01 religious reasons because, well, you know
00:06:04 that
00:06:06 Spain is a Christian country,
00:06:08 well, this  May 15 every
00:06:12 year little children at school were
00:06:15 made to dress like chulapos and
00:06:17 chulapas I really encourage you to loop
00:06:20 and look for 'san isidro' parties
00:06:23 chulapos and chulapas and chotis and well it's
00:06:26 from chotis it
00:06:28 's a very popular song  Here in
00:06:30 Madrid, what is danced
00:06:32 is danced by the chulapos in the chulapas and
00:06:35 at all times it is the woman who leads
00:06:37 the man dancing, it is very funny,
00:06:39 and the song is very beautiful. It is a
00:06:42 hymn dedicated to the city of Madrid.
00:06:45 Madrid as a
00:06:48 great
00:06:49 woman who must be conquered and
00:06:51 loved
00:06:52 and the truth is that it is true that
00:06:54 Madrid is a great lady who in the
00:06:57 end one ends up loving. Well,
00:07:00 I can tell you about Madrid' ink without going
00:07:04 too long because  This
00:07:06 can give voice, it can give many
00:07:08 videos and so that you ask me
00:07:10 what things you want to know about Madrid and that I
00:07:12 would be interested in knowing your
00:07:14 concerns,
00:07:15 well, I can say about Marie thus, that
00:07:19 's how I know  It is a great city that the
00:07:23 cultural offer is impressive. You never
00:07:26 get bored in Madrid. There is always something
00:07:27 to do, whether it is a concert or a play,
00:07:30 going out to bars,
00:07:36 going to museums, or well, or small
00:07:39 art galleries, or even there are many, many
00:07:42 cultural centers, many
00:07:43 social centers.  where there are free cultural activities
00:07:46 excuse me sorry
00:07:47 and you can go
00:07:51 and enjoy them so well
00:07:55 Madrid is wonderful Madrid is
00:07:57 great Madrid you have to come and
00:07:59 visit it because the truth is that with
00:08:02 words it falls short and then it
00:08:05 has a lot of nightlife
00:08:09 there  many, many, many
00:08:12 areas where the offer is no longer cultural
00:08:16 but the night offer to
00:08:18 party and to do other types of
00:08:21 activities also at night to dance
00:08:23 and have a drink or simply to have
00:08:26 a laugh and it was a monologue it is
00:08:29 impressive there are many things that
00:08:32 doing so,
00:08:36 well, I'm talking to you from this perspective
00:08:38 more related to leisure, it's worth it and I
00:08:43 think that  It can also be developed in
00:08:45 various videos, so
00:08:48 if Pablo agrees,
00:08:51 I would like to leave this short
00:08:54 video as a short introduction to
00:08:55 Madrid' and so that you can
00:08:58 tell me what things interest you about
00:09:00 Madrid'
00:09:02 so that I can even help you  make

00:09:23 if Pablo agrees  I agree, I think we
00:09:26 can do it like this, feedback is worth
00:09:29 sharing and because there are many
00:09:32 things that I have commented on in this
00:09:34 video and that I think can go away, that is
00:09:38 , a small video can be dedicated to each one of them,
00:09:40 the chotis is worth the party
00:09:44 from san isidro on the one hand the
00:09:47 immense cultural offer that madrid has the
00:09:49 nightlife of madrid
00:09:55 another great spanish culture the relationship
00:09:58 we have with the bars we like
00:10:00 too much i  r of bars is okay but it
00:10:02 is something very social it is a
00:10:04 meeting and meeting place therefore another
00:10:05 topic and I do not know I can think of so many things
00:10:09 that I can tell about Madrid so I
00:10:12 really encourage you to watch this video
00:10:15 to think  reflect a little if

00:00:05 Hello how are you guys my name is Andrea
00:00:08 Pérez Antillón and you can call me
00:00:10 Andrea Pérez
00:00:12 whatever you want I am from Mexico City and I
00:00:17 currently live there I am a student I am
00:00:21 19 years old and I have always liked
00:00:24 acting everything that has to do with
00:00:26 the arts
00:00:29 appearing in plays doing
00:00:32 commercial mini-series among other
00:00:35 things well, today I want to talk
00:00:37 about a topic that
00:00:40 seems super interesting to me
00:00:42 because it is a topic that I believe that
00:00:45 everyone who does not know this
00:00:48 will believe in their minds thanks to the
00:00:51 movies to series of novels all of
00:00:55 this creates an idea of ​​something that is not
00:01:00 true it is as if they were the models that
00:01:03 we all want to be models we want to be
00:01:05 like her
00:01:07 but it is because they create a concept of
00:01:09 something that they are selling us something that in
00:01:12 reality
00:01:15 and  I want to tell you that I want to,
00:01:18 I'm not from the snow, you
00:01:23 heard well, I want to talk to you about the
00:01:25 snow of snowing
00:01:27 , about this little thing that falls from the sky that
00:01:31 forms the entire ground in white
00:01:36 and
00:01:38 So yes yes I also don't know if you are one of
00:01:41 the people who created a somewhat
00:01:45 unreal fantasy in your mind thinking that the snow
00:01:48 was fabulous and incredible that when it fell and
00:01:52 you're going to fall like cotton that the
00:01:55 incredible walking on it that was
00:01:57 incredible  the view
00:02:00 I came from asking for that because that is not
00:02:03 real nothing to see it is horrible for me in
00:02:08 my experience I am going to talk about what
00:02:10 happened to me well I went to study
00:02:13 in Canada one year was around 2016 17
00:02:19 and I never in my  I had
00:02:22 never seen snow in my life, never, never, never, there was one more
00:02:26 once when I was little, I was about
00:02:29 8 years old
00:02:31 - and I was really looking forward to snow in
00:02:36 my city, in hot Mexico, that it
00:02:40 was never going to snow, at least in my city, not in
00:02:43 other parts.  from the USA yes but not in my
00:02:46 city so I decided with all
00:02:48 my strength that it should snow please that I
00:02:50 was going to behave well that it was going to be the best
00:02:53 cover in the world well
00:02:57 two hours later so as not to tell you
00:03:00 lies it
00:03:01 started to hail I was very small
00:03:07 I
00:03:09 only hail and it's snowing and I
00:03:14 had to behave well for the rest of my
00:03:15 life don't be alarmed but it was like how it
00:03:20 's snowing not really the snow it
00:03:23 was just pieces of little angel
00:03:25 that all a horsefly that exists towards the
00:03:28 snowball  but in reality it was like it
00:03:33 was like just a lump of ice there
00:03:36 you go out into the street and there was nothing that was
00:03:39 like wow it's so magical that if it's real I
00:03:43 asked for it and they just brought it in my huge
00:03:45 garden that I had it was super incredible
00:03:47 but they're doing  Let's talk about snow now
00:03:50 so I had high expectations
00:03:52 because in
00:03:54 Christmas movies in family movies they always
00:03:56 show us snow as something wonderful
00:03:58 the views the children playing in the snow
00:04:02 throwing snowballs making snowmen well
00:04:07 all that is  Really, people do it
00:04:09 but it's horrible. I'm going to tell you about my
00:04:12 experience with snow.
00:04:15 I haven't been a big fan
00:04:19 of snow or something like that,
00:04:21 but
00:04:23 with these situations that I lived,
00:04:26 much less, much more.  We are very sorry that
00:04:30 and I am going to tell you what happens to me I
00:04:33 went to kaname to study as I told you
00:04:35 all month or else I went to vancouver
00:04:37 there are laws in vancouver or rather the
00:04:41 city of rain
00:04:45 rain vancouver or rain was one thing
00:04:48 because always  it rains it always rains
00:04:51 but I didn't have as big a trauma with the
00:04:54 rain as I had with the snow
00:04:55 [Music]
00:04:57 and I tell you why because I went through traumas and
00:05:02 traumas with the snow although first of all
00:05:05 in canada there are many young
00:05:07 people many people who are from the  street
00:05:11 that's what they call them
00:05:13 and they live there on the street and what do they think
00:05:17 when it snows
00:05:21 when it's new it's horrible it's horrible
00:05:25 because
00:05:27 imagine being
00:05:30 outside on the street
00:05:33 the street is snowing you're there you
00:05:37 hardly have any clothes you're wearing the coats they
00:05:40 might have
00:05:42 you're dying  you go crazy you die
00:05:45 there were people who even threw themselves off the
00:05:47 bridges they committed suicide because of the horrible
00:05:51 cold they felt and that was not
00:05:53 montreal in montreal it is even more so i
00:05:55 say vancouver but hey what
00:05:58 I'm not going to tell you that
00:06:00 my first day of seeing the snow happened, it was all
00:06:05 almost around the dates before Christmas. I
00:06:07 think it was like November or
00:06:09 December.
00:06:11 I went to sleep by the time I went
00:06:14 to sleep I was awake and it was like
00:06:19 an awakening from a movie they don't understand my
00:06:22 cachet awake I see the window that
00:06:26 was next to me on my bed and I used
00:06:29 the window I turned around it was the most
00:06:33 beautiful thing that I said that I have seen in my life
00:06:37 all white white the eels
00:06:41 are wearing well as incredible as
00:06:43 very  father and then I, well, I was very
00:06:47 happy
00:06:48 and then I put on my snow boots,
00:06:51 my gloves,
00:06:53 my scarf, my coat,
00:06:57 we all went out, I had other people who were
00:07:00 good with me, other students
00:07:02 were two girls from Japan,
00:07:05 we left super excited, we went,
00:07:09 we were playing, we threw balls
00:07:11 of  snow that I don't know how it could first you
00:07:14 need some special gloves yes or
00:07:17 yes because with the
00:07:18 normal gloves of the
00:07:21 no it doesn't work that doesn't work so
00:07:25 you had to grab the ball d  e snow or the one
00:07:28 that you will create and when
00:07:30 you threw it the third ball that you threw your good day
00:07:32 was soaked with water your hand was
00:07:36 full of
00:07:38 cold water like the nose like the cold beer
00:07:42 that puts festive in the fridge it was
00:07:45 looking worse with a dog you  funny
00:07:48 no that was only the first day or the
00:07:50 first part of my day
00:07:53 after how much he denied that first
00:07:56 day you won't believe it help to school
00:07:59 later the streets were clogged with
00:08:03 snow but clogged with clogged
00:08:07 clogged you know super mountains of snow
00:08:10 beautiful here the snow like above you
00:08:14 was horrible it is very cool to see it but it
00:08:16 was horrible one thing that this already bought
00:08:19 that is good is that the snow looks very
00:08:23 beautiful and the landscape is incredible it is
00:08:26 white green very cool but
00:08:30 but when I was going to  the school guys
00:08:34 when I was seeing the school it was
00:08:36 going well we were on the skytrain which
00:08:39 is like a train
00:08:42 that goes like sometimes in the sky
00:08:45 obviously not flying but the sky on
00:08:48 the tracks like this then go down go up go
00:08:53 down yes  Stema is that the joke is
00:09:02 that because of so much snow
00:09:06 everything stopped transportation stopped
00:09:08 people stopped everything stopped and
00:09:11 that we had to get them down
00:09:14 they know from my school to the house it was
00:09:16 40 minutes walking 40 and  with the
00:09:20 snow double or triple because you don't walk the
00:09:22 same with snow as on ground that doesn't
00:09:24 have snow
00:09:26 then the day's section started in
00:09:29 fact I made a video about it so as not to
00:09:32 matter I just had fun with it
00:09:36 the video is here I can see everything  and the police
00:09:40 arrive and everything and everything we had to
00:09:43 get off the skyline of this train and
00:09:47 and we walked but it was horrible and
00:09:49 I am wearing boots that were like
00:09:51 leather they weren't exactly suitable for
00:09:54 rain because the rains
00:09:55 broke because of history they were some climbs
00:09:58 like leather and these leather ones were not
00:10:01 resistant enough as I
00:10:03 thought they were really as if they were not
00:10:08 made at all because the more I
00:10:11 walked the more I walked like the hand
00:10:13 with the glove got all  full of
00:10:15 water and frost that's how my feet ended up at the
00:10:19 end of the day and I had zero skirts in
00:10:22 my school zero absences and because of that beautiful
00:10:26 snow
00:10:29 I believe with one absence in my entire
00:10:32 existence from that school one absence for
00:10:36 one snow for the snow
00:10:41 this in  my life was it was fun but
00:10:44 our first doesn't matter the
00:10:47 next day
00:10:48 two weeks later it's still snowing they
00:10:49 're taking it I know you gave me those
00:10:51 boots I put them out to dry they didn't dry they
00:10:54 took a long time but not important I
00:10:57 sang in a music group and  They
00:11:00 lend me a guitar so I can practice
00:11:02 at home so that parents are
00:11:04 excited I get on the bus take the
00:11:08 bus to go home for that the
00:11:12 blocks over there are very long
00:11:17 here in Mexico the blocks are like this, that is,
00:11:20 until the car I walk and walk past  to
00:11:23 another car here long long blocks and
00:11:26 I lived on 62nd avenue so
00:11:30 we have to cross all those avenues
00:11:32 from 1 to 62 when I go on the
00:11:35 bus
00:11:39 we feel rich that they have
00:11:41 to get off all  two because we can't go there any
00:11:43 more
00:11:45 and now I think we're supposed to do it it
00:11:48 was really snowing you could see the
00:11:51 window of the bus and the snow was falling it
00:11:53 was really snowing I said I'm going
00:11:56 to do it I just brought my umbrella because
00:11:59 as it is well cuber well  It always rains, you
00:12:03 have to be super prepared for that,
00:12:06 but I wasn't ready to get off
00:12:09 the bus and walk from
00:12:13 49th avenue to 62nd, you know what you can
00:12:17 imagine, can you imagine or does it mean walking
00:12:20 from 42nd to 62nd,
00:12:26 you have no idea what it was like for
00:12:29 me  I was at this moment and I said I am going
00:12:31 to die I felt as if I
00:12:34 were walking in the desert
00:12:36 but instead of walking in the desert I was
00:12:39 walking in the snow my shoes did not
00:12:43 resist obviously it
00:12:46 was snowing I had a guitar
00:12:49 with me that was not mine that  They
00:12:51 lent it to me and I knew I couldn't
00:12:53 spoil it because it wasn't mine I grabbed it
00:12:56 with all my might I
00:12:58 hugged it to my chest I put it here I brought
00:13:03 the umbrella here my umbrella too
00:13:05 brio broke
00:13:08 came out as with the movies
00:13:12 lightning strikes as if lightning had struck
00:13:16 me and my umbrella and if it
00:13:17 had done everything upwards all ugly
00:13:20 me like this with the air the wind to all
00:13:23 that the guitar gave the snow falling
00:13:26 above me my glasses were all
00:13:29 fogged up it will be like I need one of these
00:13:31 little things for the cars nothing was
00:13:34 working well and I barely when I
00:13:37 realized with him on the sign that I could
00:13:39 see
00:13:44 avenue it
00:13:46 was only 49 avenue it
00:13:51 was a hammer I said they
00:13:55 are my  Last few days I felt my whole
00:13:57 body frozen to the bone to the
00:14:00 bone of you imagine it was terrible
00:14:02 when I got home here I
00:14:06 am that's why I'm in this video because I was
00:14:08 able to get home how I got my legs
00:14:10 my whole body was red from cold red
00:14:13 red  red from cold I think you know I got sick I
00:14:19 just wanted to lie inside the
00:14:21 covers and stay inside my bed
00:14:23 to wake up the next day
00:14:25 with a super hot bath the guitar
00:14:29 was  Well, thank God and I slept.
00:14:34 What I want to tell you is that the snow
00:14:36 can be a bit very beautiful, if not,
00:14:40 on one side of the landscape, but it
00:14:44 can also be something catastrophic. I think it's
00:14:46 like everything else, but the water can be very beautiful,
00:14:49 but  if you are on a boat in the middle of the
00:14:53 night and there is a storm
00:14:56 I think it is not the most beautiful or if you are
00:14:59 in the desert you walk you can jump in
00:15:02 a base buggy in the car the
00:15:06 many turns but if you are in the
00:15:08 cold night of the  I don't think the desert is the most
00:15:11 beautiful and that was what I had to live
00:15:14 among other snow experiences.
00:15:17 I still believe that it is beautiful to see snow
00:15:19 but if you ask me if I prefer to go to the
00:15:23 beach
00:15:24 to a place with snow to do
00:15:28 I don't know  snow I would choose to go to the beach
00:15:34 I don't know I sing a fan of the beach I like it
00:15:38 but as I am
00:15:41 I just got burned as you can see I have
00:15:43 marks
00:15:44 it was only because I was
00:15:46 under the sun for five minutes with that it was enough and I used
00:15:49 sunscreen so I would prefer it was a
00:15:52 forest know
00:15:54 if a b  I like the forests and
00:15:56 the boots and they hold up there but hey
00:15:59 this was all I hope you
00:16:01 liked it I hope you learned I don't know
00:16:03 if you had any experience
00:16:05 like this I had many more but the whole
00:16:08 video is too long to count them
00:16:10 all but well  i loved
00:16:13 sharing this with you and
00:16:17 just enjoy if you like the snow
00:16:19 go out and play i dont even know the
00:16:21 gloves because i am going to buy
00:16:24 new gloves next time i go to canada
00:16:26 and new boots
00:16:29 and probably the whole set
00:16:32 to go to the snow
00:16:34 this  it's all thanks to

00:00:06 Yes, today we are going to talk about a very
00:00:11 unknown form of Spain,
00:00:14 yes sir, which area are we going to talk about,
00:00:18 Extremadura, Extremadura, Extremadura, which
00:00:21 is a region of Spain that
00:00:27 is located in the south west
00:00:31 of the Iberian Peninsula in the southwest,
00:00:35 but  no, not as far south as andalucía,
00:00:39 right, not from andalucía, it's
00:00:43 just south of extremadura,
00:00:45 so extremadura would be between
00:00:50 portugal and castilla and andalucía would be
00:00:55 very well south of us and it's a
00:00:58 place that, well, i've been but it
00:01:02 seems to me that many foreigners don't know
00:01:05 no no no it's not a place that's still very
00:01:09 well known it's like a hidden gem it's
00:01:14 like a hidden treasure and the mind of the
00:01:18 brute exact exact exact they still do
00:01:22 n't know us too much outside just
00:01:25 let's say the profile of the
00:01:28 foreign person who knows extremadura well
00:01:33 normally it's
00:01:35 academic people or people related to
00:01:39 the study of art
00:01:43 or the study of history too,
00:01:44 then it is a very specific and obvious profile.
00:01:47 obviously very minority
00:01:50 yes because in merida explain to me what is the
00:01:55 main reason why spaniards
00:01:58 visit merida
00:02:01 there is a the main reason
00:02:04 is a is a destination for
00:02:07 domestic tourism
00:02:10 relatively popular spanish tourism the main
00:02:13 reason is that extremadura is a
00:02:17 traditionally exporting region of
00:02:21 labor then there is a lot of immigration
00:02:25 from Extremadura in Madrid in the Madrid
00:02:29 metropolitan area Madrid and the
00:02:31 surrounding cities in Catalonia
00:02:33 specifically in Barcelona and in the
00:02:37 surrounding cities In fact my father
00:02:39 my father is from Extremadura to
00:02:42 excellent that he leaves Extremadura on  It's from a
00:02:46 small town called Salorino and I
00:02:50 don't know it. I wasn't there but it's a
00:02:52 dwarf town and I'm very, very small, very
00:02:54 small, that's pretty, I'm sure it's
00:02:57 pretty, I don't know it, but I'm
00:02:59 playing it
00:03:00 so if we visit, then that's the
00:03:03 main reason.  It is the people who return
00:03:06 to the town, exactly. There are many people,
00:03:08 as I was telling you recently,
00:03:11 in Madrid.  Catalonia and also in the Basque Country,
00:03:15 especially in the area around
00:03:18 Bilbao, which is in Vizcaya, there is also a
00:03:21 lot of immigration and there are three of them, the
00:03:24 three areas where there has traditionally
00:03:26 been CSS work, exactly,
00:03:28 there is also to a lesser extent in other
00:03:30 communities as you can  be Balearic as it
00:03:33 can be attention to the valencias etra
00:03:36 but above all the three that I have told you
00:03:39 madrid/barcelona vizcaya especially these
00:03:43 people in summer
00:03:45 because they usually come and there are
00:03:48 very small towns and surely
00:03:50 salorino is one of them that in  summer
00:03:53 experiences a notable population increase
00:03:56 with all the people who come to
00:03:59 visit their parents, grandparents,
00:04:02 etc., not so a few months is the
00:04:05 main reason, it is the main reason,
00:04:07 and also, as I say for studious
00:04:10 people, not people who go to some of the
00:04:13 the cultural events that are held
00:04:16 in this area or studios,
00:04:19 either from Latin, from art or
00:04:23 from history, also because you
00:04:26 you are in merida it is the capital correct
00:04:29 yes merida was a very important roman city
00:04:32 and correct it was founded in it
00:04:35 we are enormously lucky that since the
00:04:38 romans were very meticulous when it came
00:04:41 to doing things we have
00:04:43 documentation about the founding of
00:04:46 the city that  It is in the year 25
00:04:49 of the Christian era before Christ - 20
00:04:53 local in the time of Octavio searches of the
00:04:56 first emperor of the time of the
00:04:59 Roman Empire that the city of the emeritus
00:05:02 augusta correct and owes that name in the
00:05:06 city was in a
00:05:08 strategic settlement of the  The Guadiana River was
00:05:11 founded following the
00:05:14 normal Roman patterns, which is to make
00:05:16 two large ones, a grid like
00:05:19 military camps, and two large
00:05:21 streets crossing each other like the sign of their
00:05:24 hand or an X if you want,
00:05:28 in the best rector, exactly, if the
00:05:31 correct forum, then the origin.  of
00:05:33 emerita emerita is where they went it
00:05:37 was a reward city for the
00:05:40 veterans of the Roman legions
00:05:44 that is to say the military personnel c  When he
00:05:47 passed to the reserve, that is, when he
00:05:50 graduated, rather,
00:05:53 they were granted land and
00:05:55 their space in the city and
00:05:59 later emeritus soldiers or
00:06:02 graduates of the legions who were the
00:06:04 same soldiers who were in the
00:06:07 Cantabrian wars against our
00:06:10 ancestors  indigenous people of anne before the
00:06:13 invasion problem then the
00:06:15 legionnaires who came here were
00:06:18 retired soldiers from the roman army
00:06:20 who had been fighting against the
00:06:24 natives of northern spain against the
00:06:26 cantabrians the astures then
00:06:30 they endowed this city with all the
00:06:35 facilities and all the  advances of
00:06:39 its time that were many sewerage
00:06:43 leisure and entertainment centers in the
00:06:47 middle some are still preserved yes
00:06:50 sir yes yes yes you can that you can
00:06:53 visit in merida in the middle as we say
00:06:57 one needs several days to be able to
00:06:59 see all of them let's say that he is
00:07:03 the flagship  that is to say, the best
00:07:06 known average is perhaps the complex
00:07:10 that forms in the tea  theater and the amphitheater
00:07:11 the theater
00:07:14 is very well preserved and
00:07:18 has been restored in a very
00:07:21 respectful way with the origin unlike
00:07:25 other places in spain
00:07:28 where things have not been done the same
00:07:31 comes to mind sagunto for example
00:07:33 the one in  Mérida quite faithful let's say to its
00:07:38 original appearance and such is the case that two
00:07:42 thousand years later theater is still held
00:07:44 there so it is still used
00:07:48 it is still used in summer we have
00:07:50 during the summer months July and
00:07:54 August we have the international festival
00:07:57 of classical theater that already has  more than 60
00:08:01 editions that are said soon and it is a
00:08:04 cultural benchmark for all of Spain
00:08:09 and internationally as well and it is a
00:08:11 real pleasure to be able to
00:08:15 sit in this stands and be able to
00:08:18 appreciate the classic authors or
00:08:22 contemporary adaptations of
00:08:26 classic themes some of the gases of the theater
00:08:30 Exactly if the car and all these
00:08:33 authors is something that impresses
00:08:36 travelers a lot, it is something that I
00:08:38 always recommend  Cer if one visits
00:08:40 the Roman theater,
00:08:42 especially if you go with a friend with
00:08:44 someone who accompanies them, they cannot
00:08:48 test
00:08:52 the sound
00:08:54 within that space, that is, your
00:08:57 friend can go to the scene and you, from
00:09:00 above everything, can listen to  your
00:09:02 friend talk to you because the resonance
00:09:05 as designed is a real
00:09:08 wonder at that time there were no
00:09:10 microphones or speakers or anything like that
00:09:13 so it is designed in such a way that
00:09:17 the sound propagates in an
00:09:19 optimal way and I am fine if all the
00:09:24 seats exactly  It's exactly
00:09:27 marvelous, well
00:09:28 , I agreed I went
00:09:31 to Merida when I was little. I remember that it's
00:09:33 preserved. I think there's also a
00:09:35 wall.
00:09:37 Well, there are several sections of the city
00:09:40 where remains of the original wall, the
00:09:43 most spectacular is the one you can see.
00:09:47 from the roman bridge from the
00:09:49 very roman roll to the right there is a building
00:09:52 that is the arab
00:09:55 citadel the citadel is a castle like a
00:09:58 citadel within the city and e  It is
00:10:01 built by recycling ashlars, that is, by
00:10:04 recycling Roman construction materials,
00:10:06 but at the base you
00:10:09 can perfectly see
00:10:11 what is the base of the original Roman wall
00:10:13 and then there have been recent excavations.
00:10:23 It is an archaeological site on top of which
00:10:26 there are administrative buildings today,
00:10:28 but it has been preserved very well and
00:10:31 you can visit the
00:10:34 wall layout, original roads and
00:10:38 the houses that were in the area and
00:10:40 everything is quite well preserved. There are
00:10:42 several points in  Merida where you can
00:10:44 see the remains of the wall that used to
00:10:47 exist, yes, I think it is a very, very
00:10:50 interesting place to visit if you are
00:10:52 interested in
00:10:55 Roman history from the Roman period in
00:10:57 Spain. Yes, there is outside of Merida,
00:11:01 there is beautiful  to visit in the rest of
00:11:04 extremadura there are a lot there are a lot
00:11:08 of things there are there are people who even
00:11:11 call us the spanish tuscany yes  Due to the
00:11:13 amount of
00:11:17 monumental artistic historical heritage that there is and that
00:11:20 refers to various different times
00:11:22 and Roman Merida
00:11:24 only 60 kilometers to the north
00:11:29 , even now, driving from
00:11:32 Merida, you have Cáceres.
00:11:37 UNESCO and there is
00:11:41 a place that I always recommend
00:11:43 visiting in Cáceres, which is the old town.
00:11:46 So when you get to the Plaza de
00:11:49 Cáceres, you go up some stairs, go through
00:11:53 an arch, immediately
00:11:56 jump back in time for a thousand years and you are
00:11:58 in the middle of the  14th century bone 7 and it is
00:12:04 preserved in a wonderful way you
00:12:06 know all the buildings these houses are
00:12:10 old they are all medieval they are all
00:12:12 medieval and they are very well very well
00:12:16 preserved they have
00:12:19 scrupulously respected the heritage of the
00:12:22 city and the atmosphere of authenticity
00:12:26 that one has  When you enter what is
00:12:30 the old part of Cáceres, it is
00:12:32 indescribable but it is not only
00:12:35 Cáceres.  But there are more places where we also have
00:12:40 a lot of spaces worth
00:12:44 contemplating and places that take us back
00:12:47 to another era, not a very beautiful place if
00:12:50 you come from Madrid,
00:12:53 barely 80 kilometers from Mérida
00:12:56 Trujillo, which is a very small city
00:12:59 but it is completely another marvel
00:13:01 wonderful the center
00:13:04 has is has a
00:13:09 beautiful Renaissance main square full of
00:13:12 incredible palaces and buildings and then it has one
00:13:14 going up in the direction of the castle because
00:13:17 it also has its citadel of the castle it
00:13:19 already portrays you well at the time to the time
00:13:22 of the Arabs
00:13:25 in fact that  It gives a little bit of the name
00:13:27 to the extreme region of Extremadura, there are
00:13:30 people who believe that the name is x
00:13:33 extreme and hard, that it is the climate and not the
00:13:36 climate of Extremadura, tremendously hard, very
00:13:39 difficult to live there, in the image
00:13:42 that some people believe they may
00:13:44 have  not the name but in fact the
00:13:47 climate the only thing that is rigorous here is
00:13:49 the summer heat that is quite a lot
00:13:51 but if Madrid is not colder  or in
00:13:53 summer it's hotter in winter mother it's
00:13:56 colder than here in colder yes yes
00:13:59 at least in the area in merida this would be
00:14:02 the baja extremadura caceres to the
00:14:04 province of caceres it's a little
00:14:06 higher and it's a little colder than in
00:14:08 the province below, but here some
00:14:10 winters are very mild,
00:14:11 for example, in Mérida it snows once every
00:14:15 20 or 25 years, so here when it wears that, it
00:14:19 's a spectacle, that is, yes, much
00:14:22 less, much less than in Madre, yes yes yes
00:14:24 yes yes of course the name  I was telling you that
00:14:27 Extremadura really dates from the
00:14:30 time of the reconquest, that is, from the
00:14:33 period
00:14:36 from 711, from the time the
00:14:39 Muslims entered the peninsula until
00:14:43 the capture of Granada, throughout this period
00:14:45 Extremadura simply and plainly
00:14:47 refers to the land of  no one that
00:14:51 was between the Christian kingdoms
00:14:54 the area of ​​the Muslim kingdoms and
00:14:57 Extremadura initially has been
00:14:59 even much further north was in the
00:15:00 area of ​​Soria Soria Pura Cabeza de
00:15:04 Extremadura qu  Today,
00:15:05 it used to have nothing to do with Extremadura, right, and
00:15:07 that moved south
00:15:09 to the south until it reached the area
00:15:11 where we are now, and really the
00:15:13 origin of the y stayed dry, and the name
00:15:16 exactly Extremadura, yes.  I really
00:15:19 have it for you that it suggests to you as a
00:15:23 no man's land, which is how it really has been
00:15:26 achieved.
00:15:26 I don't know how it got there, how to get there,
00:15:29 but yes,
00:15:31 and one thing that I really liked when I
00:15:34 visited Extremadura is the nature.
00:15:38 Tell us what is interesting
00:15:41 to visit, well.  we have a we have
00:15:44 several parks the main one the
00:15:49 largest perhaps the best known is
00:15:51 monfragüe yes it is in the province of
00:15:56 cáceres in the northern half of extremadura
00:15:59 so monfragüe is a wonderful place it
00:16:01 is on the tagus river it is
00:16:05 bathed by the tagus river which  It is the great
00:16:07 river that passes through Alta Extremadura
00:16:10 through the province of Cáceres, which goes
00:16:13 through Portugal exactly to Ico A. It
00:16:15 is the river that I wanted from Spain, that is, it
00:16:18 passes through Toledo.  It goes through the province of
00:16:21 Cáceres including Monfragüe and
00:16:23 eventually ends up in
00:16:26 Lisbon in Monfragüe. It is an ideal place,
00:16:30 for example, not only for the
00:16:33 great variety
00:16:34 of flora and fauna typical of this area
00:16:39 but also for the
00:16:42 peace that is breathed and the tranquility
00:16:45 It's there and it's so good to breathe. It
00:16:47 has a viewpoint that is fabulous. It's an
00:16:49 Arab castle that has been
00:16:53 converted into a viewpoint.
00:17:06 some views over the
00:17:09 landscapes of the tagus which is
00:17:12 simply wonderful it is a
00:17:15 very popular place here for excursions for
00:17:18 example of the giles from the school but it
00:17:20 is a highly recommended place it is not the
00:17:23 only park we have close
00:17:25 to measure
00:17:26 we also have the  cornalvo park
00:17:30 you are around an artificial lake
00:17:33 that the romans made a reservoir
00:17:37 a reservoir to obtain drinking water
00:17:39 then they made  They were another one here, very close to Mérida,
00:17:41 also called Proserpina, and
00:17:44 in both cases you can see the
00:17:46 engineering work of the dams that they
00:17:49 made, and this site, Cornalvo, that
00:17:52 I'm telling you about, is also a beautiful natural park
00:17:54 and there, well, one can appreciate
00:17:58 the flora.  Typical here, which would be, well,
00:18:01 above all, what is the cork
00:18:04 oak, the holm oak, the cistus
00:18:06 and you, for example, go to these parks,
00:18:08 come in, I recommend if you are not allergic to
00:18:12 pollen and you go there in spring, it is
00:18:16 a symphony of fragrances from all the
00:18:19 aromatic plants  there you go you
00:18:22 stay a while ago and you clean yourself completely it
00:18:24 is an experience that I recommend there are more
00:18:27 parks apart from these two moors they are
00:18:29 let's say the two that I know the most what
00:18:32 you said about peace and tranquility
00:18:34 well I remember it a lot it is perhaps something
00:18:37 a constant around  Extremadura is
00:18:40 not remembered that Extremadura is one
00:18:44 of the places where the stars were seen the
00:18:46 most at night
00:18:49 because there are not many exact big cities.
00:18:51 to exact is a a little advantage not the
00:18:55 good one of the many advantages that
00:18:58 we have in extremadura
00:19:01 the light pollution here is much less
00:19:04 than in other parts of the country the
00:19:08 largest city in the region if the region
00:19:10 is already very sparsely populated the
00:19:12 The largest city would be Badajoz, which is
00:19:15 the capital of the homonymous province
00:19:18 of Badajoz, which is Baja Extremadura,
00:19:20 since it will have 120,130,000 inhabitants and it is
00:19:25 the most populous city.
00:19:33 For
00:19:36 90,000 and I'm talking about the most
00:19:38 populated cities and at night there are a lot of
00:19:41 places where you have the sky to yourself, it
00:19:44 's whole at night even in
00:19:47 areas of Mérida, for example, my mother who
00:19:49 lives in an area far from
00:19:52 the city center  more on the outskirts on your
00:19:54 terrace at night it's the whole milky way
00:19:56 no and that's wonderful i'm
00:19:59 scott it's impressive things that in madrid
00:20:00 or barcelona it's very difficult to
00:20:03 appreciate you really have to go far away
00:20:06 madrid near the city madrid or
00:20:09 barcelona near the city never
00:20:10 impossible impossible
00:20:13 and i think the last thing for which
00:20:16 extremadura is known to the rest
00:20:19 of spaniards is
00:20:22 food gastronomy and gastronomy we
00:20:26 can approach it from two angles from
00:20:30 two points  From a point of view, on the one hand, we have
00:20:33 gastronomy expressed in typical dishes,
00:20:36 things that are typical here, as it
00:20:40 may be for me, for example, my
00:20:42 favorite dish of Extremadura gastronomy is
00:20:45 the lamb stew. It
00:20:48 is your apology if there is any vegetarian
00:20:53 using this, which is  a dish
00:20:56 that is the most social dish that there is
00:21:00 paella in paella can also be
00:21:03 a very social society knowing but the
00:21:05 stew
00:21:08 is cooked in a cauldron, that is to say in a
00:21:10 very large container and it is done in the open
00:21:13 air it is done in the open air  libre vale always
00:21:16 was the one that is eaten in summer
00:21:18 well it is eaten more and more than in
00:21:22 summers and in summer especially spring
00:21:24 and autumn more than in winter for
00:21:28 obvious reasons  ios because of the weather that better
00:21:31 not but normally the stew is
00:21:33 also usually eaten on the occasion of
00:21:35 family or social celebrations
00:21:38 so it is prepared as it is a dish that
00:21:41 takes a long time to make meanwhile
00:21:44 people are socializing badly and when it
00:21:48 is prepared it is eaten again
00:21:50 Not everyone is served communally with their own dish and it
00:21:53 's wonderful. There are some many
00:21:55 restaurants
00:21:57 in the region that also serve them as a
00:21:59 dish, but as I say,
00:22:01 the ideal thing to
00:22:03 do is to eat the stew
00:22:05 in a group and in the open air
00:22:08 with the  family with the family
00:22:10 this would be the focus of
00:22:13 typical dishes apart from the stew and many
00:22:14 more not and then the other focus would be on
00:22:18 gastronomic products tips of those from
00:22:21 Extremadura of indisputable quality
00:22:24 but what is it that we know best in the
00:22:26 rest of Spain  they are the products
00:22:28 imported from extremadura xi the most
00:22:31 notorious is perhaps the ham the iberian ham
00:22:37 that comes from animals that live  n in the
00:22:41 countryside they live in the meadow the meadow is the
00:22:45 typical landscape of extremadura it is a country we have
00:22:48 done before holm oaks cork oaks is
00:22:50 correct and widely spaced in the in the
00:22:53 meadow and space between tree and tree and
00:22:57 these trees the holm oak gives off its
00:23:00 fruit which is  the acorn
00:23:03 the acorn that I practically do not know how
00:23:06 it is consumed very little by
00:23:09 humans instead it is the basis of the diet
00:23:12 of the Iberian pig it is in Spanish it is
00:23:15 considered to be the best ham it is the one
00:23:17 that is exact the acorn-fed ham is
00:23:23 considered  the highest quality but it shows
00:23:25 in the flavor also in the texture you
00:23:28 compare it with the normal Serrano ham and
00:23:30 it is a completely different thing
00:23:34 and it is
00:23:35 let's say it is one of our
00:23:38 star products but apart from that there are more products
00:23:41 we have
00:23:43 very unknown unfairly
00:23:45 unknown we have some  Yes, the cheeses
00:23:50 are incredible, that is, I like the cheeses that are
00:23:53 in Extremadura. It
00:23:54 is wrong for me to say so,
00:23:56 but I think they would be one of the
00:24:00 best in the world, I would say.  In the world I
00:24:03 have lived in France and there are some that
00:24:08 are very typical. I am not going to say that it is
00:24:11 better than French cheese, but it is
00:24:13 certainly not worse than what I have tried in France
00:24:16 and some fabulous cheeses, there is not a great
00:24:18 variety, but in Spain  whole there is a
00:24:20 great variety of cheeses too and among
00:24:22 those cheeses you have
00:24:25 to try Extremadura they are wonderful and
00:24:27 because they are also Spanish the best
00:24:29 known are Manchegos Manchego cheese
00:24:31 no yes yes yes yes yes here here
00:24:35 we have a lot of cheeses
00:24:37 For example, we have the torta del casar,
00:24:40 which is a cheese, nothing, nothing to
00:24:44 do with Manchester, another concept of
00:24:47 cheese, no, and you can eat it in another way, it
00:24:49 opens at the top and you spread it
00:24:51 directly, and that's wonderful, I
00:24:55 haven't tried it.  The proven thing I tell you the father
00:24:58 is from Extremadura there
00:25:00 are 5 or 5 brothers so whenever
00:25:04 one goes to Extremadura and comes back well he
00:25:07 brings blood sausages and sausages also
00:25:12 his other examples the sausages the
00:25:14 blood sausages like that yes  it comes from the same animal
00:25:17 that we have said before that of the pig
00:25:20 raised all its life in the field without
00:25:23 any type of stress and with the most
00:25:26 natural diet possible not so there was a
00:25:30 time in the past a time when
00:25:32 we are too young but
00:25:36 in which  Pig food carried
00:25:40 certain health risks due to
00:25:44 certain things,
00:25:46 for simplifications, infections that
00:25:49 heat could transmit to you, that is a thing of the
00:25:51 past, the veterinary control
00:25:54 that these animals have is
00:25:56 absolute, so the product derived
00:25:59 from the Iberian pig
00:26:02 and today it is  a product that complies
00:26:04 with all the sanitary guarantees, that is, it
00:26:07 is the healthiest thing that one can eat, it
00:26:09 has no plan, but I would not like to
00:26:12 forget another fundamental element of
00:26:16 our gastronomy, which is the paprika
00:26:18 that they make on the side, it is wonderful, it
00:26:21 is joy  of any dish is
00:26:22 wonderful
00:26:23 well the base of the chorizo ​​is not yes
00:26:26 correct it is correct corrector projects
00:26:27 and it is what I will give d  e color the beige of
00:26:30 color in the spiciest vein is also
00:26:32 famous in Spain if I have here I have
00:26:36 here in my apartment in Thailand it's great
00:26:38 great great genius because you put it on
00:26:40 something that is there or if it magically gives it
00:26:42 flavor of tea it makes it happy  exact exact and
00:26:45 also in Extremaduran wines
00:26:49 little by little they are opening up they are
00:26:53 opening up we have denominations
00:26:56 of origin and all that and it accompanies that
00:26:59 delicious gastronomy that we have
00:27:00 issues in wine and gastronomy
00:27:02 so it is another of the other
00:27:05 attractions that we also have for
00:27:07 gourmets who want to visit
00:27:11 Extremadura, perhaps they need a
00:27:13 marketing expert absolutely
00:27:16 absolutely
00:27:18 and someone who targets us is an ideal place
00:27:21 to attract quality tourism, that is, it
00:27:25 is a place that does not attract the
00:27:28 masses and  I sometimes say half
00:27:31 jokingly half seriously I love the
00:27:32 sea and I love the beach but I say
00:27:34 fortunately we don't have a beach because
00:27:37 that per  mite to maintain the main
00:27:40 attraction of extremadura is
00:27:41 authenticity if then mass tourism well
00:27:45 you can have a beautiful
00:27:49 fishing village
00:27:52 overnight it becomes
00:27:54 something else and you can do it you can
00:27:57 call it marbella or benidorm which were
00:27:59 towns of  fishermen who would have a
00:28:02 lot of charm here when I tell you
00:28:05 authenticity has other advantages
00:28:07 that we have of being isolated or not
00:28:10 being subject to mass tourism is the
00:28:13 behavior of the people so the
00:28:17 people here are extraordinarily
00:28:19 hospitable to the visitor it
00:28:22 is a place where  you ask
00:28:24 anyone on the street and they stop
00:28:27 to talk to you and they will explain
00:28:28 where you want to go or what it is or
00:28:30 whatever then normally the visitor is
00:28:33 more reluctant to talk than the locals
00:28:34 because the visitor is used to it
00:28:36 even though  in other places do not pay attention
00:28:37 if I see this I see this in all
00:28:41 countries I know even here in Thailand I go
00:28:44 to the places where  Where are they used to
00:28:46 dealing with tourists I know and the people are never friendly
00:28:49 and curious but debate
00:28:53 you move away you go to places where foreigners don't normally go
00:28:54 the trenches and the
00:28:56 people are much friendlier ccss is where
00:28:59 you live in thailand in the calera bangkok
00:29:02 bangkok
00:29:05 but yes  It's true and good in Barcelona,
00:29:08 for example, you can find the same
00:29:10 thing if you go to the most touristy neighborhoods and
00:29:12 such and I don't know, I don't know if people are very
00:29:16 focused on earning money money
00:29:19 money 6s money money money but I do think
00:29:25 that well Extremadura could
00:29:29 benefit  Not a lot, maybe a little
00:29:31 more tourism, I would always be
00:29:33 sustainable and correct, absorb filling and
00:29:37 put the right people like that
00:29:39 in more. If tourism is not sustainable,
00:29:42 I prefer not to have it, that is, tourism
00:29:45 has to be sustainable, a tourism that
00:29:47 is not  sustainable
00:29:49 destroys authenticity
00:29:54 and that which makes you unique from each region
00:29:56 of each area of ​​the same thing I am talking about
00:29:59 Extremadura that I am talking about any
00:30:01 Pyrenean landscape  co de catalonia or
00:30:04 asturias or any other part
00:30:07 of the country is not that authenticity
00:30:11 sustainable tourism helps to preserve what
00:30:15 you have is looking for a visitor profile
00:30:18 that is respectful of what they see and
00:30:21 that enjoys it without altering it
00:30:25 or at least without altering it  Negatively
00:30:26 altering obviously the very presence
00:30:29 of visitors already alters what was there
00:30:31 before but at least it doesn't leave
00:30:33 any negative imprint and that's it
00:30:35 that's tourism but as you say we
00:30:38 need
00:30:40 a marketing expert to
00:30:42 direct us yes well thank you very much
00:30:47 Thank you for informing us because well, it
00:30:50 is clear that you know a lot about both the
00:30:53 history and the area and such and well,
00:30:56 surely thanks to you many people will be
00:30:59 encouraged to visit Extremadura in the future,
00:31:02 I would love to. I am far from being an
00:31:05 expert, that is, the  opinions of a
00:31:09 citizen of the street but yes, of course,
00:31:12 if it helps in some way to make people
00:31:18 respectful of the environment and with
00:31:21 it and with urban landscapes  You are encouraged to
00:31:24 come to Extremadura I would be
00:31:26 delighted of course and that encouraged
00:31:28 you to come and visit us here and I
00:31:33 when the theme of 'the hobbit' comes up
00:31:36 and I'm sure I'll get there late,
00:31:38 it's a recurring thing
00:31:41 among all the groups  of friends that
00:31:43 we talk on skype or through your etc.
00:31:48 when this changes we will see each other and
00:31:51 we will have some beers when we can
00:31:53 and I really want it to be possible
00:31:56 and that we no longer have to say these
00:31:58 tags if we hope so
00:32:01 well well  Thank you very much and I hope that
00:32:03 you help us to record some other video of
00:32:06 course you can count on me a pleasure
00:32:09 you will see César bye see you later

00:00:05 Hello everyone, how are you? My name is
00:00:08 Agustina, I'm from Argentina and today I'm going
00:00:12 to talk about a topic that interests me a
00:00:15 lot. I'm going to explain a
00:00:18 little about how
00:00:21 low cost airlines work in the world, low
00:00:26 cost airlines  They are something that many people
00:00:29 cannot understand because until a
00:00:32 few years ago this was not possible and
00:00:37 not to mention 40 years ago when to
00:00:40 travel by plane you had to be a
00:00:42 person with a lot of money so
00:00:46 I, the aeronautical person, am going to
00:00:51 explain a  a little bit about what are the
00:00:54 measures or decisions that
00:00:57 low cost airlines take to be able to
00:01:00 sell tickets to be able to sell
00:01:04 tickets at such a cheap price Compared
00:01:08 to other airlines let's start well the
00:01:11 first thing that
00:01:14 low cost airlines do is have a fleet like this
00:01:18 It means having the same model of
00:01:22 aircraft. Why? Because having only one
00:01:27 model of aircraft, one type of aircraft
00:01:30 , maintenance training expenses,
00:01:35 among other things  With much lower
00:01:39 costs,
00:01:40 just think about having to
00:01:43 train the pilots and
00:01:47 cabin crew, only those people,
00:01:50 if they have only one type of plane, will
00:01:53 have one type of training, but if
00:01:56 we have more types of planes, then
00:01:58 we have to have more types of training.
00:02:00 personnel etc. the same with the
00:02:04 mechanics The mechanics have to know
00:02:06 how to fix and how to work a single
00:02:10 type of airplane in this way all that
00:02:13 is training and maintenance
00:02:17 expenses and operating expenses also of other
00:02:19 types are much much less besides
00:02:24 having these airplanes  that they are all the
00:02:27 same the issue of distribution
00:02:30 inside the plane is very important there are
00:02:34 many seats and when I say many there is a
00:02:39 lot of space between one
00:02:43 seat and the other is very small
00:02:46 Compared to a traditional airline it
00:02:50 is more the same seats are
00:02:55 thin  In this way they can have more
00:02:59 passes on a flight and earn more money per
00:03:04 flight, in part comfort is sacrificed
00:03:09 for d  inero but something important and
00:03:14 another measure of the low cost airlines
00:03:16 is that all the flights are quite
00:03:19 short why because they want the
00:03:23 plane to make as many flights as
00:03:27 possible when we make
00:03:30 longer flights for more than that they are generally more expensive
00:03:34 profit  In percentage
00:03:38 let's say it's less because the plane is
00:03:41 stopped on the ground much much
00:03:45 longer so in this way by making
00:03:50 many short flights they can make more
00:03:52 flights per day and the plane is
00:03:55 percentage in percentage More much
00:03:59 more time in the air than on the ground
00:04:02 In addition to this, they do not make any type
00:04:06 of short flight, but rather they usually make
00:04:10 short flights between medium-sized cities or
00:04:15 between a large city and a
00:04:18 medium-sized city. Why Because Generally,
00:04:22 traditional airlines make flights
00:04:25 between large cities and if they make a
00:04:29 flight to a medium-sized city, that  flight is going
00:04:32 to be very expensive so
00:04:36 low cost airlines look for medium-sized cities with
00:04:40 a distance that is not even m  Very short
00:04:43 Because if it is very short, people
00:04:45 can go by car or by train, nor is it
00:04:50 too long, since it takes a long time, they
00:04:53 look for the right distance so that going by
00:04:57 car is not an option.
00:05:03 a
00:05:06 traditional airline has this route
00:05:08 another measure that low cost airlines take
00:05:12 is to leave secondary airports there
00:05:15 is the typical ryanair meme in Paris
00:05:20 that flies to a Paris airport that is
00:05:24 literally not in Paris it is
00:05:27 about two hours away that Maybe it is a  a bit
00:05:30 extreme but a very typical case is
00:05:34 London in London We have a lot of
00:05:38 airports we have gatwick City
00:05:42 and luton I think So I don't know
00:05:46 easyjet or ryanair don't fly to London
00:05:50 because it's too expensive so they fly to
00:05:54 London City or agatwick they do go to
00:05:57 airports a little more  cheap and if they
00:06:01 cannot go to these cheaper airports
00:06:04 or if there are also many
00:06:07 airlines in those airports they take
00:06:11 measures they make decisions within the
00:06:14 airport what  e are cheaper an
00:06:17 example is not having a sleeve the sleeve is the
00:06:21 corridor that goes from the building from
00:06:25 the terminal to the airport
00:06:27 having a sleeve is very expensive because
00:06:31 you think that the airlines pay
00:06:34 for everything they are paying for
00:06:38 the parking space then  a
00:06:42 much cheaper thing is the bus When
00:06:46 you take a small bus
00:06:49 to the plane and you walk up
00:06:52 obviously This is not very fun for
00:06:56 the passengers And if there is rain it is very
00:07:00 cold or it snows it is not very nice but it is
00:07:04 much cheaper for
00:07:07 Another thing that the airlines do and that many
00:07:10 people may be surprised is
00:07:14 choose times that are bad Because
00:07:18 when you pay when an airline
00:07:21 pays for a route if from one city to
00:07:25 another it is not the same to pay for doing that
00:07:29 route at  4 in the afternoon that at 4 in
00:07:33 themorning
00:07:34 then you are going to see that the
00:07:38 low cost airlines usually have
00:07:41 horrible schedules, they are flights at 6 in the
00:07:45 morning at one in the morning
00:07:47 those  schedules that nobody likes, not
00:07:51 when you have to get up and say
00:07:54 Oh God I don't want to but what happens these
00:07:57 schedules are much cheaper and if a
00:08:02 low cost airline has a plane that is not
00:08:05 going to fly at night it
00:08:08 often takes this plane  to a
00:08:12 very, very small airport for the
00:08:16 plane to sleep yes you heard well sleep
00:08:21 when planes have to spend a
00:08:24 night on earth they
00:08:26 have to sleep in an airport and you
00:08:30 have to pay for that because the plane is
00:08:33 taking up space in an airport so
00:08:37 many large airports  They do not have a
00:08:40 place, for example, ezeiza, the
00:08:43 largest airport in Argentina and the main one
00:08:46 in Buenos Aires, does not have a place, that is, the
00:08:49 plane cannot sleep there and if it does have a
00:08:53 place, it is super expensive, so Many
00:08:57 low cost airlines make ferry
00:09:01 or transport flights with the plane  empty to go
00:09:05 to a smaller airport And that the
00:09:09 plane sleeps there and I know it seems super
00:09:13 super crazy because they are literally
00:09:16 paying for fuel and everything to go and
00:09:21 return  but Compared to the cost of
00:09:24 sleeping in a large airport, it's
00:09:28 crazy, it's a huge difference and they
00:09:32 prefer that the plane sleep in a
00:09:35 smaller airport. Another measure that
00:09:38 low cost airlines take is to
00:09:41 charge you for absolutely everything, so
00:09:45 when you see the beautiful price of  20
00:09:50 euros to fly is just that, but if
00:09:54 you want a seat, a carry-on bag, a bag
00:09:59 to
00:10:00 use food or a boarding pass when
00:10:03 you want anything, that is paid separately,
00:10:07 I know that from the passenger side one
00:10:11 can say how bad it is but it is
00:10:15 understandable. Because if you are  paying 20
00:10:18 euros for a plane flight they cannot
00:10:21 include everything else is that they do this
00:10:26 for other reasons in the first place Because the
00:10:30 heavier the plane the more
00:10:35 fuel it uses if this is a
00:10:39 basic rule The heavier the more
00:10:42 fuel it uses So if the
00:10:45 airline can ensure that passengers
00:10:47 do not carry luggage and that they carry as little as
00:10:50 possible the plane weighs less
00:10:54 another thing is the time in you  erra
00:10:58 when people get off the plane it is estimated
00:11:03 that 40 minutes or so are lost
00:11:07 in people grabbing their suitcases by
00:11:11 hand and it seems crazy but in
00:11:15 total in all flights it is estimated that
00:11:18 maybe in smaller planes it is less
00:11:21 time but  A lot of time is wasted
00:11:24 for people to take their luggage,
00:11:28 fix it and leave. So, as
00:11:31 we said before, the airlines not only all the
00:11:34 low cost airlines, but especially the
00:11:38 low cost ones, want to have the plane fly,
00:11:41 they don't want the plane on the ground,
00:11:43 so also by charging extra  for
00:11:47 all these services it makes
00:11:49 people carry less luggage and take
00:11:52 less time to leave the plane another measure they
00:11:56 take is the crew you can
00:12:00 see that the largest airlines
00:12:02 have a place where the
00:12:05 crew lives perhaps the most
00:12:08 luxurious example can be  Emirates or Qatar who
00:12:12 literally give
00:12:14 their pilots and
00:12:18 cabin crew a free apartment in Dubai other airlines
00:12:21 don't do this  no But they still have
00:12:25 all the crew in one place in the
00:12:28 case of low cost airlines This is not the
00:12:32 case, they have bases in different
00:12:35 cities and This makes it much
00:12:38 easier for crews to move
00:12:42 think that if we have a
00:12:45 center in London another  in Milan and another
00:12:49 I don't know in Germany it is much easier than
00:12:54 manipulation of Milan make all the
00:12:56 flights near Italy the one in Germany
00:12:59 all the ones near Germany and the one in
00:13:02 England all the ones in the United Kingdom
00:13:04 that a pilot has to go from London
00:13:08 to  Madrid from Madrid to Paris no
00:13:12 Also because some of you may already know
00:13:16 this the crews expire What
00:13:20 does it mean that they expire that they have a
00:13:23 maximum time that they can be flying and
00:13:26 then they need to rest then
00:13:31 again what is always wanted are
00:13:33 short flights so the  person who
00:13:36 lives in Milan goes to I don't know Milan Rome
00:13:38 comes back later goes Milan Zurich in Switzerland
00:13:43 comes back later does Milan Barcelona
00:13:47 comes back understand they do everyone  flights
00:13:49 like this and then they are at home and they
00:13:52 sleep there is no hotel
00:13:56 to pay for food in another city it is much
00:14:00 much easier but well one last
00:14:04 thing that I forgot to mention is that
00:14:06 inside the airports they also have
00:14:09 the worst  doors happened to me, for
00:14:13 example, being in amsterdam and having
00:14:16 to walk for half an hour to find the
00:14:19 ryanair door, which was like in a
00:14:22 basement underneath everything, all dark.

00:00:07 Espino I am 24 years old and I am from
00:00:10 Morelia Michoacán Mexico that is to say I am
00:00:13 Mexican and I am going to tell you a little
00:00:16 about what gastronomy or food is
00:00:18 from here where I am from which is from
00:00:20 Morelia Michoacán and also from Michoacán
00:00:22 and perhaps we will touch on some information
00:00:25 about Mexican food as such, but I would
00:00:27 love to talk to you about the food,
00:00:29 also good, the style
00:00:32 of Michoacán food and Morelian food,
00:00:34 because even though we
00:00:37 are  and we are in mexico it is very
00:00:40 different from the style that other
00:00:41 states of the mexican republic have but
00:00:44 hey we are going to start by talking about
00:00:47 something that for me personally is one
00:00:49 of my favorite dishes and in this
00:00:51 case I am talking about the pozole the pozole
00:00:54 that precisely  Now that
00:00:56 these special dates are approaching, which in fact is
00:00:58 for any date of the year, we are going, it
00:01:01 is good, pozole is prepared, pozol is
00:01:04 one of my favorite dishes of all
00:01:06 Mexico, but
00:01:07 perhaps I am going to tell him more or
00:01:09 less how my family usually prepares it. In
00:01:11 general terms,
00:01:14 there are three types of pozole, which are
00:01:16 red pozole, green pozole, and white pozole,
00:01:19 which are the most traditional.
00:01:20 These colors are for the  flag of
00:01:22 mexico
00:01:24 the red dessert is usually prepared
00:01:26 with a little seasoning and not only
00:01:29 seasonings but also a little bit
00:01:30 of chili is that they are not peaks but if they
00:01:32 paint the broth red color which is
00:01:35 good firstly to explain a
00:01:38 little to continue  explaining the
00:01:40 colors and what kind of meat they have,
00:01:41 let me tell you that the pozole is the
00:01:43 summer of corn cooked in broth with
00:01:46 some meat in seasonings and that they are
00:01:48 accompanied with a lot of vegetables and are
00:01:50 accompanied with a lot of things, it is a
00:01:52 completely Mexican dish and that is
00:01:55 They will find anywhere in the
00:01:57 republic in any part of Mexico
00:01:59 that they go clearly as I mentioned at the
00:02:01 beginning of the video prepared
00:02:02 di  different ways but well, as I was
00:02:04 saying a moment ago, the dish, the
00:02:07 red pozole, is not only prepared with
00:02:10 chili peppers that paint the broth a little
00:02:12 red, but they are also
00:02:14 usually prepared with
00:02:16 pork,
00:02:17 it is not necessarily that it has to
00:02:19 be like that, but  This is how it gets used to,
00:02:21 not because our culture already has the
00:02:23 idea that red pozole has to go with
00:02:25 port meat, but we also talk about
00:02:27 green pozole. Green pozole
00:02:29 used to be made sometimes with
00:02:31 pork meat and chicken meat from the  two
00:02:33 cards sometimes they put beef in it
00:02:37 but not only does it have to be that way,
00:02:39 many people also use it to
00:02:40 put only chicken meat and
00:02:42 greens because they put a little bit of
00:02:44 green chilies that are not spicy, it is a
00:02:47 little bit but they paint  a little bit of the broth
00:02:49 and a little bit of spices that paint the
00:02:52 broth a little bit green and that's
00:02:53 how they take on a very light green it's not
00:02:56 strong green it's a very light green last
00:02:59 imo we are left with the white pozole the pozole blanco
00:03:02 is traditionally always made
00:03:04 from chicken meat and they do not
00:03:07 put it in a seasoning that can paint
00:03:08 the broth precisely because they want to
00:03:10 keep this color this color that this
00:03:12 light color because it is like that like that but
00:03:17 they have to  necessarily preparing all
00:03:19 three is to the taste of the family and to the
00:03:21 taste that I prepare it to the taste of
00:03:23 whoever wants to eat it which they want to
00:03:26 prepare in many places they are
00:03:27 used to selling all three or to sell
00:03:29 fingers that are white or red
00:03:32 but not  Only the dish remains there,
00:03:36 but at lunchtime on the Mexican table you
00:03:37 always have lettuce, you
00:03:40 have onion, you have oregano, you have
00:03:42 some yellow súchil manzano chili oil sauce
00:03:45 that does not irritate but
00:03:48 is very spicy
00:03:50 for those who are not  the best one has
00:03:53 the same one in this same type of chili it
00:03:55 has the name in other countries but
00:03:56 hey going back to the topic it is also
00:03:58 accompanied with toast it is accompanied with
00:04:00 radishes and est  e that perhaps all
00:04:02 these things that I am mentioning
00:04:04 have some other name in another country
00:04:06 but here they are called that way it
00:04:09 is like a large salad on top of
00:04:13 the pozole broth because this is all
00:04:16 this is mixed it is also put lemon
00:04:18 salt depending on the taste of the people
00:04:20 and they are very spicy dishes because it
00:04:23 is one of the things that say a lot
00:04:26 about Mexico in its gastronomy and it
00:04:28 is true that the food is
00:04:29 more spicy than any other country
00:04:31 and well this is great because we
00:04:34 experience  very much with the flavor
00:04:36 as well as there are delicious things in
00:04:38 different countries in Mexico the
00:04:40 seasonings are very important and well
00:04:43 I am going to continue telling you about more than more
00:04:45 dishes such as
00:04:47 golden tacos which is any type of stew,
00:04:49 whether it is potatoes or
00:04:50 any stewed meat as best  you
00:04:53 like it rolled in tortillas in king in
00:04:57 thin tortillas and then make it
00:04:59 like a type of flute make a new one
00:05:02 and then undo it cook
00:05:04 Let them drain a little in the oil and
00:05:07 when they are going to be served on the plate they
00:05:10 are garnished even semis or we win that they
00:05:12 are garnished with what is also lettuce
00:05:16 Cooked potatoes Cooked carrot
00:05:19 Cream cheese Sauce to taste because that does
00:05:22 fit  mentioning enough that everything that
00:05:24 has to do with hot chili sauces
00:05:27 to this type of Mexican things there are
00:05:30 dishes that are spicy from their
00:05:32 preparation but most are not like that
00:05:34 , the spicy or what
00:05:38 is chili sauce is simply left on the table and each
00:05:41 who will prepare it to their liking because it
00:05:43 is a myth that all Mexicans
00:05:44 eat extremely spicy there are
00:05:46 Mexicans who do not say spicy and there are
00:05:49 Mexicans who do not eat anything spicy and
00:05:52 no seasoning it may surprise you to
00:05:54 hear this but real
00:05:56 and so obviously there is  other Mexicans who
00:05:59 fully comply with the rule
00:06:01 that they eat extremely spicy but it
00:06:04 was just a curious fact for
00:06:05 you
00:06:07 and in this case we can also be able to
00:06:10 c  Adding more dishes,
00:06:12 some of the dishes that we
00:06:14 love here are like the ones I
00:06:16 mentioned, the tacos dorados, the pozole,
00:06:18 but there are also dishes that are
00:06:20 exclusively from Michoacán and
00:06:24 exclusively from Morelia that are
00:06:27 not known outside of Morelia and that are not known outside of
00:06:29 Michoacán.  You know even when
00:06:31 we are the same country, Mexico, one of these
00:06:35 dishes is the columns. Perhaps you have
00:06:38 never heard them mentioned and perhaps
00:06:40 people from other states, even within
00:06:43 Mexico, have not heard you
00:06:44 mention what I mean by this, the
00:06:47 columns are a kind of  tamales that
00:06:49 are made with one plus a little more than
00:06:51 half but that is still very tasty are
00:06:53 wrapped in a banana leaf from
00:06:55 the banana tree
00:06:59 where where these in these tamales which is
00:07:02 a ball of dough and they are sewn  They are allowed to be
00:07:04 sewn with steam and this steam
00:07:07 cooks them since they are ready on the
00:07:09 plates they can be served well there
00:07:12 are also stuffed there are planets of different
00:07:14 figs  ures of tortilla chips now that
00:07:16 in different places in Michoacan they are
00:07:19 prepared in different ways as well as
00:07:21 there are different types of flavors
00:07:23 of columns different types of
00:07:25 food dough but to summarize just to
00:07:27 summarize sorry it means that it is a
00:07:29 tamale a little more salty  from the normal one and
00:07:32 with another type of dough
00:07:34 , cream cheese is put on top and some
00:07:37 sauce or some sauce that has a
00:07:40 broth with some type of spicy or non-
00:07:43 spicy basic mentioning it is to
00:07:46 everyone's taste and they are only known in
00:07:50 Michoacán it is a dish  Too delicious
00:07:52 that if one day you have the opportunity to
00:07:54 visit Michoacán, which is very beautiful in
00:07:56 its gastronomy, very beautiful in everything you
00:07:59 can see, you cannot leave without
00:08:01 trying the columns,
00:08:03 but not only that,
00:08:05 I also mentioned that there were good things more than
00:08:07 dishes  of gastronomy
00:08:11 that are only from Morelia what do I
00:08:14 mean by this I mean that there is
00:08:16 something very tasty that is only exclusive
00:08:19 to Morelia  What are gazpachos? What is
00:08:22 a gazpacho? The name must sound a
00:08:24 bit strange to you, well, let me know this one, it's
00:08:26 delicious and it's something very fresh, because
00:08:28 I'm talking about fruit, and I'm going
00:08:31 to tell you about the traditional one, because it
00:08:32 can be eaten with any type of chopped fruit.
00:08:34 in little squares but I'm going to tell you
00:08:37 about traditional which is pineapple scale and
00:08:40 mango
00:08:42 this is fruit these three fruits are
00:08:44 only chopped into triangles in
00:08:48 small squares and put
00:08:51 the orange juice on top as if it were sugar
00:08:54 the orange juice until they are filled
00:08:57 until it is going to spill or it is
00:08:59 going to throw you inside, well, on
00:09:03 some surface that barely
00:09:05 touches the surface of the plastic cup
00:09:08 where these dispatches are normally served
00:09:11 and on top of it you put
00:09:16 what is cheese
00:09:18 , it goes  putting chili powder to
00:09:21 taste some you put chamoy sauces
00:09:25 but sauces
00:09:27 I mean up to the sixth a lot of valentina sauce
00:09:31 other types of sauces these are not that they
00:09:34 are a little for  For snacks or just a
00:09:36 little for a snack it is not
00:09:37 necessarily a homemade sauce
00:09:40 and all some people like
00:09:42 advice and some like it with
00:09:44 chili personally I have to confess
00:09:46 that I do not like it with onion or
00:09:47 green chili  What is the green chile or
00:09:49 the jalapeño chile if it is spicy but I
00:09:52 do not like it with the algae that is
00:09:54 keeping it sweet from the fruit and
00:09:56 I only like one and
00:09:58 include a little what is
00:10:01 next to the cheese but something else in
00:10:03 Personally, I don't like to put it but it
00:10:06 would be great if they also feel the
00:10:07 opportunity to visit the city
00:10:09 of Morelia programs from these offices
00:10:11 since they are fresh and quite rich
00:10:13 and are only traditional in the city of
00:10:15 Morelia I say goodbye but I was
00:10:18 very happy to have  shared all
00:10:20 this information with you and I hope
00:10:22 you have had to try a little bit of
00:10:24 everything from the gastronomy of Mexico from
00:10:27 Michoacán de Morelia I say goodbye
00:10:28 I hope you are very  good until
00:10:30 next time
00:10:38 and

00:00:05 hello carlos how are you hello how are you pablo
00:00:08 that you very well very well very well
00:00:12 today we are going to talk about the ladino
00:00:15 and I well Carlos you are the person I
00:00:20 know who I think knows the most about the subject and
00:00:22 I found it very interesting to interview you
00:00:24 to  this video
00:00:26 thank you well I can tell you that Carlos
00:00:29 helped me well review the video that we already
00:00:33 published about the ladino and well I
00:00:35 wanted to thank you first for
00:00:37 helping me with this video not always a
00:00:39 pleasure to help with this kind of thing and
00:00:41 also because I  It contributes to
00:00:44 spreading Ladino, yes, then explain to us a little
00:00:48 how good you are doing in terms
00:00:51 of Ladino and well, in 2017
00:00:56 I started together with a Sefarat and Ben Yauad
00:01:00 or from New York and my colleague and friend
00:01:02 Alejandro Hacer or a digital file that
00:01:05 It's called Ladino 21 and where we try to
00:01:07 show how Ladino is spoken in the
00:01:10 21st century in different countries of the world,
00:01:13 okay, you are creating such an archive of
00:01:16 content recordings of people
00:01:19 speaking it.  If the objective is to document
00:01:21 the language as it is spoken from a
00:01:23 more or less descriptive point of view,
00:01:25 although the descriptive has always
00:01:27 reached the constructive point of view, and after three years
00:01:30 we created a company called it is a
00:01:33 community page company, it means that
00:01:36 the  Most of what we generate goes
00:01:38 back to the
00:01:39 global Sephardic community and there we not only
00:01:42 have the digital archive but also
00:01:43 apps to learn Ladino, Ladino courses,
00:01:45 etc.
00:01:53 all of history and
00:01:57 how we got to the point
00:02:00 where we are today no but well in this
00:02:03 video I would like you to explain to us a
00:02:06 little more what is the situation right
00:02:08 now in which the language is right
00:02:10 now the ladino is for a  side
00:02:12 in a very delicate situation it is difficult to
00:02:14 estimate how many people speak Ladino
00:02:16 in the world today but it is normally
00:02:20 said that around 100,000 people  If they
00:02:22 speak it with
00:02:23 a poor degree of fluency,
00:02:27 but on the other hand, there are many
00:02:29 initiatives at the university level,
00:02:31 especially to relaunch
00:02:34 Ladino. On the one hand, we have the
00:02:36 decline of communities and
00:02:38 homes where
00:02:40 Ladino is traditionally spoken and  On the other hand, a
00:02:41 revival of Ladino in the field,
00:02:43 above all, university and cultural, yes,
00:02:46 well, we can explain
00:02:49 in case there are people who have not seen
00:02:52 the other video, that this is good when
00:02:56 you said Sephardim and it is the people
00:03:00 who are the Sephardim  Can you
00:03:02 explain to us both Ladino as a
00:03:04 vernacular language and the Sephardim were born with
00:03:07 the expulsions at the end of the 15th century from
00:03:09 the Iberian Peninsula in the four
00:03:11 kingdoms that existed at the time and these
00:03:13 expulsions occurred between 1492 and
00:03:16 1499, that is when the community of
00:03:19 expelled Jews became  in an
00:03:22 itinerant diasporic community that
00:03:25 we call Sephardic Jews, those
00:03:27 who come from Sepharad, which is  an
00:03:29 abstract,
00:03:29 even mythical concept that graphically has to do
00:03:33 with what the Iberian Peninsula is
00:03:35 ' but also has
00:03:36 connotations of a desired place to which they
00:03:39 return, so these Jews expelled
00:03:43 from Spain continued to speak their language,
00:03:47 it is not a key distinction, it is not Ladino
00:03:51 ex  existed before the diaspora in one
00:03:54 part and in another in what sense
00:03:56 Ladino began in the 13th century in the
00:03:58 Iberian Peninsula as a language tracing
00:04:01 a word-for-word translation of
00:04:04 liturgical texts and for this reason this
00:04:06 custom of translating liturgical texts word-for-
00:04:08 word  in a language
00:04:10 that was not vernacular that was not spoken
00:04:11 on the street because because it was an
00:04:13 artificial language translation word for
00:04:15 word purposeful translation word
00:04:18 for word of Hebrew texts of texts
00:04:21 written in Hebrew and Aramaic that were
00:04:23 used for liturgical purposes and
00:04:25 there is a  moment when rabbis
00:04:26 realize that their audience cannot
00:04:29 understand what they are saying  or and they
00:04:31 need to say it in something close to
00:04:33 the languages ​​and romances that are spoken
00:04:35 then in the Iberian Peninsula and what they
00:04:37 do is translate the word
00:04:39 so this language does not speak to you it is not
00:04:41 vernacular but it is used for
00:04:43 liturgical purposes that is the ladino
00:04:45 that was spoken before  that existed
00:04:47 before the expulsion but was not spoken and
00:04:49 he said it as a vernacular language spoken
00:04:52 by the community among its members it
00:04:54 starts with the diaspora it does not exist
00:04:57 before the expulsion that starts with the
00:04:58 diaspora and is based on the languages ​​that
00:05:01 people spoke  in the places where they
00:05:03 were, they are Romance languages,
00:05:05 true, Aragonese, Spanish, Catalan,
00:05:08 etc. Well, there is a Koiné, oh, oh, there is
00:05:11 a
00:05:13 crystallization of all those languages ​​into
00:05:16 a language common to those people, right, I
00:05:20 see, I come from what is now Galicia,
00:05:22 you come  of what is now Catalonia and
00:05:24 we find a common linguistic point
00:05:26 to understand each other because that is the
00:05:27 grammatical basis of Ladino and that is why it is
00:05:29 so similar to  Contemporary Spanish
00:05:32 then come words from the
00:05:34 territories where those Jews settle
00:05:36 what is now Italy what
00:05:38 is now Serbia Turkey Greece So
00:05:41 well, you have told me before that they
00:05:44 ask this question a lot and it's
00:05:47 good that you are also interested in talking about
00:05:49 it  what is it is Spanish it is the same
00:05:53 language no it is not the same language they are two
00:05:55 different languages ​​that is the
00:05:57 short answer the explanation of why that is
00:05:59 so it is it is partly what I just said
00:06:02 the similarities come from the
00:06:04 grammatical basis of Ladino  and contemporary Spanish
00:06:07 has a lot of similarities,
00:06:10 but the differences come from the fact
00:06:13 that between the 16th century and the 19th century,
00:06:17 Ladino, which develops in the diaspora,
00:06:18 and peninsular Spanish, develop
00:06:21 in parallel and almost isolated from
00:06:24 each other, and hence not only  are not
00:06:27 the same language but within the
00:06:28 diasporic ladino itself that is being
00:06:30 developed in isolation with respect to
00:06:33 the peninsula, dialects are created  s
00:06:36 within Latin itself and that is why ladino is spoken in Thessaloniki,
00:06:38 it is different from how
00:06:39 it is spoken in istanbul, for example, that is why it
00:06:41 is geographical isolation within
00:06:44 ladino itself, that is, within the ddi
00:06:45 there are no different dialects,
00:06:47 you can even find dialects
00:06:49 within the  same the same ladino I said
00:06:52 then you have told us that in
00:06:55 your organization you are creating
00:06:58 a content file showing like a
00:07:02 monkey of recordings looking for how to
00:07:05 speak in ladino not to preserve it
00:07:08 what value do you think the
00:07:11 conservation of languages ​​has because this is
00:07:14 something that
00:07:15 I think is good  that different people
00:07:17 have different opinions about
00:07:19 how important it is to preserve a
00:07:22 language no and what are the benefits is
00:07:25 a very interesting question for him
00:07:26 because many times that question is framed
00:07:28 in terms of benefits
00:07:30 indeed good actually how does
00:07:33 this actually improve the community  that
00:07:35 we get the rest of the people that we
00:07:36 give ourselves part of the community  ad of the
00:07:38 preservation of this language and for me
00:07:39 there is a much more important previous question
00:07:41 which is that the preservation of
00:07:44 a language is actually a
00:07:46 human right so many times I think that
00:07:48 we worry about justifying in
00:07:50 terms of utilitarian benefits is it
00:07:53 true the preservation of  the language, but
00:07:55 I believe that all languages ​​are
00:07:57 recognized de facto as something that should
00:08:00 exist and that is part of human rights
00:08:01 today, so starting
00:08:04 from that base, the
00:08:05 preservation of any language is justified, then
00:08:08 a second question that would come
00:08:10 after this one  The first in terms of
00:08:12 basic human rights would be
00:08:14 the benefits it has in terms of
00:08:15 preservation, and obviously the
00:08:17 main benefit is to preserve
00:08:21 the way of life of the Sephardic community.
00:08:24 We cannot separate the language from the
00:08:25 community of speakers of that language,
00:08:28 that is the medium in which  Spanish traditions are expressed
00:08:30 and a way of
00:08:33 understanding life that is closely linked  to
00:08:35 the Ottoman Empire in the
00:08:37 Mediterranean area that would be lost if
00:08:40 that language became extinct, then the
00:08:43 value is not only documenting the
00:08:46 language, as there was not only the
00:08:48 historical purpose of documenting, but
00:08:52 there is also a value in which
00:08:55 that language continues to be spoken and  If
00:08:57 that community of people
00:09:00 who speak it and exactly continues to exist, and the two are
00:09:03 linked in the practice of
00:09:04 documentation, it also has the objective
00:09:06 of making the dina known and demonstrating
00:09:10 its importance, which is why I said before that
00:09:11 in reality we can say that
00:09:13 we make a  purely descriptive work
00:09:15 but in practice that description is always
00:09:17 accompanied by a
00:09:19 normative objective now something you want to
00:09:21 do with that description of an objective
00:09:23 which is in this case to preserve the language
00:09:25 and spread
00:09:27 it throughout the world of
00:09:28 course then
00:09:31 in your organization what would be
00:09:33 your objective  In the end where would
00:09:36 you have to go to say ok we
00:09:39 got what we wanted  We don't
00:09:41 need to work anymore,
00:09:45 this is a question for us, it's
00:09:48 really a process and the day
00:09:51 the 121 is finished it will be one of salaba that
00:09:53 we hope will not end with an
00:09:54 incomplete process because the objective is to
00:09:56 document the language as it is.  It
00:09:58 exists all over the world, so right now
00:10:00 we were talking about before, it's true that there are about
00:10:02 100,000 people in the world who speak
00:10:04 Ladino right now, the percentage that
00:10:06 we have documented of all this is
00:10:08 approximately 6 percent,
00:10:10 and we have been making
00:10:13 a video every week since 2017  about how
00:10:16 Latino is spoken in a different region of the
00:10:18 world and in all this time
00:10:20 we have only documented 56 percent,
00:10:22 that is, one is an enormous amount of work
00:10:25 and it will really take
00:10:27 generations
00:10:28 another is called Ladino the 21st century because
00:10:30 it will not take us  a century to document how
00:10:32 it is currently spoken then all this
00:10:35 process of documenting and
00:10:39 preserving languages ​​in danger of disappearing
00:10:41 let's say as it has  changed with the
00:10:44 development of the internet and new
00:10:46 technologies,
00:10:48 a very important peculiarity in the
00:10:50 case of the ladino is that there is no such distant pair,
00:10:52 there is no territory or
00:10:55 nation-state that belongs to the
00:10:58 community of sefarad and obviously the
00:11:01 state of israel understands that the
00:11:02 software a dyn are Jews and therefore
00:11:04 have the right to Israeli citizenship
00:11:06 but the state language is Hebrew in
00:11:09 this case and even Ari is not
00:11:12 clearly behind Yiddish in
00:11:13 terms of diffusion
00:11:15 so in technology what it has
00:11:18 allowed is to do  That people who
00:11:21 belong to territorial communities
00:11:23 that are geographically very
00:11:25 distant can communicate in the same space
00:11:27 instantly,
00:11:29 so it has been tremendously positive
00:11:31 for the Latin-speaking community and
00:11:34 this process began around the year 2000
00:11:36 with the creation of an email group
00:11:38 that  called ladino community and where the
00:11:41 only requirement is to write in ladino and
00:11:44 then people of all kinds write  the
00:11:46 world every day approximately
00:11:47 between 10 and 20 messages from all over
00:11:50 the world in ladino and that creates a
00:11:52 feeling of community a
00:11:54 digital home what has been called a
00:11:56 digital place and ladino 21 also has that
00:11:58 aspiration of being a digital home
00:12:00 where  Through the fact that only
00:12:02 Ladino is communicated to people, the language can
00:12:04 also be better preserved
00:12:06 because it is necessary to create
00:12:08 dignified spaces and spaces where the language that one
00:12:10 aspires to preserve is the only
00:12:12 vehicle of communication and these
00:12:14 people who participate  In this
00:12:16 community you find that they are above
00:12:18 all people who are children or grandchildren of
00:12:22 Sephardim who want to reconnect with their heritage a bit. You
00:12:25 also see
00:12:28 people who have no
00:12:32 connection to their past but who are
00:12:34 simply interested in the subject is
00:12:36 that the  Dina is a language with a
00:12:38 very important ethnic component,
00:12:40 so it is closely linked not only to the
00:12:44 concept of inheritance, but actually of
00:12:47 herenc  ia above all religious but
00:12:49 also but also to the concept of
00:12:52 belonging sometimes it seems necessary to
00:12:55 justify within the community itself
00:12:57 because people who are not jewish work
00:13:00 on money like me that is a
00:13:03 good thing something that I had considered because
00:13:06 I don't know if it is true or not but  The
00:13:10 Jewish communities have a bit of
00:13:13 the impression that people have the
00:13:16 idea that they don't necessarily
00:13:19 get that the more people the better to join
00:13:21 their community, no, sometimes we
00:13:25 come across this barrier with this
00:13:27 obstacle, especially for him the issue  to
00:13:30 apply for scholarships or funds to document
00:13:33 the language, which are sometimes restricted
00:13:35 to sefarad in bala, but also, on the
00:13:39 other hand, the community is aware
00:13:42 that they need allies just like the
00:13:44 community of origin, and they also have allies
00:13:46 that do not necessarily identify
00:13:48 with the  bisexuality or lesbianism in
00:13:51 all communities that are
00:13:52 threatened need allies and I
00:13:56 also personally found a
00:13:57 lot of g  Enerosity when it comes to
00:13:59 facilitating interviews, translations,
00:14:01 transcripts that we have is only a
00:14:03 little bit of both, I don't know, I think it is a
00:14:05 very interesting subject, and beyond that, well,
00:14:09 because it is closely linked with this, with the
00:14:12 subject of religion and such, but a lot
00:14:14 with history.  and with the history of
00:14:18 spain and with the good result of
00:14:21 spain of the kingdoms
00:14:24 of the peninsula at that time and of
00:14:27 something that was as a result of something that
00:14:30 happened in that territory that later, as
00:14:33 you say, well happened in the balkans
00:14:34 and many other places  and
00:14:37 reading about this subject, he has found
00:14:39 very interesting things such as that in the
00:14:41 north of Morocco they continued to speak
00:14:43 Ladino for several fourteenth centuries
00:14:47 as well.
00:14:57 In Spain you can feel part of the
00:14:59 Sepharad community and there is still no concept
00:15:01 that persists in Spain and outside
00:15:06 of Spain about Spain according to which
00:15:09 Spain is  t is a catholic country that is a
00:15:11 legacy of the national
00:15:12 catholicism of the catholic kings of the Franco regime
00:15:14 etc. and obviously it is not true but
00:15:17 the idea continues to exist that if someone
00:15:19 in Spain dedicates themselves to languages ​​attached to
00:15:21 this other religion different from
00:15:23 Christianity there must be some
00:15:25 basic argument and I believe that I do not believe
00:15:27 that we have to naturalize the fact
00:15:29 that the Spanish deal with issues
00:15:32 concerning Jewish Muslim regions
00:15:33 etc. no so for me
00:15:36 also wine is part of my
00:15:38 culture simply as it can be the
00:15:41 Mozarabic or  as it can be other languages
00:15:42 that are not Spanish
00:15:44 and in this sense with respect to the
00:15:48 second topic the language of the Jews of
00:15:51 northern Morocco is really a
00:15:52 different language from Ladino although
00:15:54 associated more associated with Ladino than for
00:15:56 example Spanish is the jacket
00:15:58 that  it comes from the arabic jaka which means to
00:16:00 speak and so
00:16:02 this is a language that is still
00:16:05 in danger of extinction may  r than that of the
00:16:07 ladino and that it is spoken by a handful of
00:16:09 families in the north of morocco and that it is
00:16:11 not even really
00:16:14 capable of being documented due to the
00:16:15 scarcity of people who speak it so
00:16:17 alicia has been, for example, in three one
00:16:19 of the  major specialists in this
00:16:21 language who lives in new york but
00:16:22 really if this language we can say
00:16:26 you are going to appear in the next generation
00:16:28 well yes it is always a shame to hear that
00:16:31 good thank you very much for today I don't know
00:16:34 if you want to add something else before we
00:16:36 say goodbye good  I would like to add
00:16:39 perhaps that many people have the
00:16:42 feeling that documenting the language using
00:16:44 in technological media while helping
00:16:47 that language is just taking an
00:16:49 archaic ancient past reality and
00:16:52 putting it in a new technological bowl and
00:16:54 I would like to emphasize that that  is not
00:16:56 necessarily the case one of the things
00:16:58 that is necessary to rehabilitate
00:17:00 endangered languages ​​is to
00:17:02 reassess them ideologically show
00:17:05 that in real  ality are fit for
00:17:08 21st century purposes
00:17:10 and using technology to
00:17:12 revitalize languages ​​is also
00:17:14 intended to show that Ladino
00:17:16 can be cool that it can be appreciated
00:17:19 as it is in the 21st century that it is not
00:17:21 an archaic reality or an
00:17:23 archaic language  and that also applies to many
00:17:24 other languages
00:17:26 since your objective is to
00:17:28 demonstrate that it is still relevant
00:17:30 if the 21st century is a combination that
00:17:36 may seem unintuitive but that it is
00:17:39 real and works very well well
00:17:42 I will leave a link below in  the description
00:17:44 to your organization to the web
00:17:47 and then you also have a
00:17:50 personal channel on youtube not that you talk about what
00:17:53 you talk about on your channel well it is a
00:17:55 sister initiative called and the
00:17:57 hyper neat activist and that tries to
00:17:59 show that which is which  is what is
00:18:02 the political value of languages ​​a
00:18:04 bit why we learn languages ​​not
00:18:06 simply to accumulate a
00:18:08 cultural symbolic capital that we show in a
00:18:11 youtube channel but really to
00:18:12 make a difference is to make a
00:18:15 difference in the world, that is, through
00:18:16 helping in the translation of
00:18:18 refugees or revitalizing languages
00:18:21 etc. so the ladino intersects
00:18:23 with ladino 21 and leaving the
00:18:26 activist towns on this tangent very well
00:18:29 Well, if you are interested in this topic,
00:18:33 I will also leave you the link to
00:18:36 Carlos's channel in the description and well,
00:18:39 thank you very much Carlos and I don't know maybe in the
00:18:42 future we will meet again I hope to be able to
00:18:46 collaborate on something
00:18:48 thank you very much Pablo for the work you
00:18:50 are doing with  Spanish and with
00:18:51 other languages, the success you
00:18:55 have achieved on the YouTube channel is incredible, it
00:18:57 really is an inspiration for others
00:18:59 who are starting out in the field,
00:19:00 thanks to everyone

12,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about the good things
00:00:02 and the bad things about all the
00:00:04 good things but some bad things also about
00:00:07 having a girlfriend
00:00:11 [Music]
00:00:15 good well
00:00:17 yes, as many of you know I have a girlfriend
00:00:20 and for a few months and I had
00:00:23 not had one for many years  girlfriend, it
00:00:25 had been a few years since I had a girlfriend and
00:00:28 well I thought that today I will talk to you about
00:00:29 the good things and the bad things of
00:00:32 having a girlfriend and well I am going to tell you
00:00:34 the bad things first so I can get
00:00:37 rid of them and we can talk
00:00:40 After the good things, we also finished
00:00:42 the video and you are left with a good taste
00:00:44 in your mouth, not better, better like this, and for me,
00:00:48 for me, the worst thing about
00:00:50 having a girlfriend is the anger, it is that there are
00:00:53 arguments that there are fights and that  the
00:00:55 girlfriend gets angry or that I get angry
00:00:58 what happens is that I normally don't get angry
00:01:00 when I have had problems of this type,
00:01:02 it was because my girlfriend got
00:01:04 angry because we had an
00:01:05 argument or a fight
00:01:09 and well the first thing to say is  that with the
00:01:11 girlfriend that I am now with my girlfriend
00:01:14 we are very well and we have
00:01:17 never had a fight we have never really had a fight but
00:01:19 this has been a problem with other
00:01:21 girlfriends that I have had before well
00:01:24 especially with one but not only with
00:01:27 a couple we have had a  couple of girlfriends that
00:01:29 I had, well, from time to time we had
00:01:31 arguments and some fights, no,
00:01:34 and well, this is a problem, one negative thing,
00:01:38 much more drama than
00:01:40 I would have in my life in other ways.
00:01:45 For example, I've argued or I've had
00:01:47 problems with friends but the simple
00:01:49 fact of having a girlfriend makes
00:01:51 that happen a lot more, it doesn't seem like
00:01:53 the emotions are much stronger
00:01:56 and it's easier for there to be some kind
00:01:58 of fight or argument or anger  or that he gets
00:02:01 angry in some way and another thing
00:02:05 along with another negative thing about having a
00:02:07 girlfriend that can also be something that
00:02:09 later causes anger and fights is
00:02:12 jealousy is that there is jealousy that a person
00:02:15 is jealous  I dare of the other or that I am
00:02:17 jealous I am jealous of my girlfriend or that my
00:02:19 girlfriend is jealous of me in my case I
00:02:21 am not a jealous person normally
00:02:23 I am not jealous when I have been when
00:02:26 I have had a girlfriend
00:02:27 I have trusted her neither has she  I had
00:02:29 reasons to distrust my girlfriend is a
00:02:31 little bad given no reason to
00:02:34 distrust and while my girlfriend
00:02:37 treats her friends and their friends well,
00:02:39 as friends
00:02:40 I don't have any problem I
00:02:42 'm not really a jealous person
00:02:45 but if what sense the opposite
00:02:47 Well, my girlfriend has been very jealous of me,
00:02:50 especially a specific girlfriend.
00:02:53 If you see my daily intermission videos,
00:02:57 you are subscribed to know, it's
00:03:00 that I told you about this girl, not and well, she
00:03:02 would get very jealous and immediately the one she was
00:03:05 talking to  with a girl and I laughed or something
00:03:08 because I already felt jealous and then, well, she would
00:03:12 start yelling and she would get
00:03:14 very angry and that, because I don't like
00:03:17 anything and jealousy because it is another
00:03:19 negative thing about having a girlfriend and finally the
00:03:23 last one  something so negative that at
00:03:26 least for me the lack of freedom is so important
00:03:29 and this happens with any
00:03:32 couple I think no it does not depend it does
00:03:34 depend a little on who you are with
00:03:36 but who more and who less well is
00:03:39 going to have something  Lack of
00:03:41 freedom, even if it's because you have less
00:03:43 time because you know you're going to spend more
00:03:45 time with her and you're going to have less
00:03:47 time to do other things, but it
00:03:49 depends on how serious your
00:03:51 relationship is and on your girlfriend, well, what
00:03:54 expectations do you have about yourself?  You are going to
00:03:57 have even less freedom
00:04:00 and that is something because you have to be
00:04:01 willing to accept that if it is your first
00:04:04 partner or if you have not had a
00:04:06 partner for a long time at first it may seem to
00:04:08 you that you have less freedom
00:04:11 that there are things you would like to do  and that
00:04:14 maybe now you can't do it or you can't
00:04:16 do it as often or that it's more difficult to
00:04:18 do than when you didn't have a girlfriend, but
00:04:23 well, you have to see if it
00:04:24 pays off and the fact of being with this
00:04:26 person  Yes, well, if you really love
00:04:28 this person and it's worth it to be
00:04:30 with her or if you prefer that freedom that she
00:04:32 has that you would have in another way and right
00:04:36 now with the girl I
00:04:37 'm with, well, I can see it, let's see, it's not the same,
00:04:40 yes, I would have a  a little more freedom and
00:04:42 maybe I would do something I don't know if I would say
00:04:45 things that I don't do but well if I would do
00:04:48 things that I don't do I would go and
00:04:50 meet other girls but right now
00:04:53 well
00:04:54 it's not a problem for me to
00:04:56 be only with one girl right now
00:04:57 I myself am fine only with my
00:04:59 girlfriend
00:05:01 but also in other fields that
00:05:04 now I don't do things that maybe I
00:05:06 would do otherwise
00:05:08 no I haven't been lately in recent years
00:05:10 because I don't play videogames much but
00:05:13 maybe if I didn't have a girlfriend and start
00:05:16 playing  a video game that I really like
00:05:18 because maybe it would happen to me, I would spend hours
00:05:20 playing, no, and that's something that
00:05:22 I wouldn't do now, because I have a girlfriend and I already know
00:05:25 that she wouldn't like it or that she
00:05:27 would want it even if she was born with it or
00:05:29 what  That we should see a movie together or something
00:05:33 and in that sense, well, I have a little
00:05:35 less freedom but well, it's not the end of the
00:05:37 world, it's something that right now is worth it to me, I
00:05:39 think it's worth it, as
00:05:42 it affects my freedom the most, really having a
00:05:45 girlfriend is  With the fact
00:05:47 that I can't go live in another country I
00:05:50 can't easily say oh I'm going to live
00:05:52 in Spain I'm going to live in Taiwan I'm going
00:05:54 to live somewhere else no that's now it's
00:05:56 more complicated I have to think about the
00:05:59 two in our work well
00:06:02 everything becomes more complicated there are more things
00:06:04 to think about and more work
00:06:07 is not impossible and in the future well it
00:06:10 could be that with my girlfriend we go to
00:06:11 live somewhere else but of course it's good it
00:06:14 's less  freedom is more difficult to
00:06:17 do something like this but well there are also
00:06:19 positive things and now we are going to talk
00:06:21 about the positive things of having a
00:06:23 girlfriend and the first positive thing is that
00:06:27 my life is healthier surely I do
00:06:30 healthier things I don't eat milk with
00:06:33 cereal for dinner  for instance  that this is something
00:06:36 especially when I was at the
00:06:37 university that I was studying and
00:06:39 working at the same time one day if I
00:06:42 came home late and I didn't feel like cooking well
00:06:44 maybe I would have a bowl of milk with cereal for dinner
00:06:46 not the same as if it were
00:06:48 breakfast
00:06:50 and there are things  So, having a
00:06:52 girlfriend, I no longer do the fact of having
00:06:55 a person, a person, perhaps even
00:06:58 a person
00:07:01 who judges you a genius, as it does, it
00:07:04 also makes you take more care of yourself,
00:07:06 of course, of the other person and of
00:07:08 the other person.  take care of you but
00:07:09 simply the fact that there is someone
00:07:11 there makes you perhaps be a
00:07:13 little more careful and do more
00:07:16 normal things and in the end your life will
00:07:19 surely thank you and
00:07:21 your health will also thank
00:07:23 you now too  I don't go three days without
00:07:25 showering, for example, let's see, even
00:07:29 if I'm alone, normally I usually take a
00:07:31 shower every day, but of course, if
00:07:34 one day I don't feel like it, one day it's cold or
00:07:38 whatever and I don't have  I have to go to an
00:07:41 office to work or a school, it's
00:07:44 very easy to say anything, I'll leave it for
00:07:46 tomorrow and spend a couple of days without
00:07:48 showering, and when it's very cold in
00:07:50 winter, maybe three, well, having a girlfriend, the
00:07:53 process that doesn't happen is that
00:07:56 he remembers you and he remembers things for
00:07:59 you not that he remembers you it's good that
00:08:01 he remembers you and of course having
00:08:02 someone who thinks of us
00:08:04 is also very good but I mean
00:08:07 let's talk about
00:08:08 practical issues here  that he remembers things
00:08:11 because I forget things
00:08:13 I often forget things I am a
00:08:15 forgetful person and I forget, well, I have
00:08:18 to buy toilet paper or whatever I do
00:08:20 n't forget things and look, I
00:08:23 write things down because  I already know that I forget I
00:08:25 usually have a list with all the
00:08:27 things I have to do I sign up
00:08:29 in general I write down everything I have
00:08:31 to do everything I agree on what I
00:08:34 remember well I write it down but of course
00:08:37 sometimes I forget to sign up and  the  things
00:08:39 because I am a forgetful person that I
00:08:41 forget things and sometimes I forget
00:08:43 to write it down
00:08:45 and my girlfriend often reminds me of
00:08:47 things and that is very good it is very
00:08:50 practical because you forget less
00:08:51 things and if there is toilet paper then better
00:08:55 than  If there is no real paper,
00:08:57 then it is very practical. Another thing
00:09:00 is that we share out the chores of the
00:09:02 house that when you start to clean the
00:09:05 house, you start to sweep, you start to remove
00:09:07 the dust, you start to do the laundry, well, it
00:09:09 is  less work because you share you
00:09:12 share the apartment and of course if I sweep, well, I sweep
00:09:15 for both of you and all the dirt
00:09:17 from both of you and even swept and even the
00:09:19 floor clean if you do the laundry, well,
00:09:22 you have to do the laundry once,
00:09:23 you can put the clothes of the children  two and
00:09:26 everything is done faster no
00:09:29 I don't know if in total it is less work because
00:09:33 it is true that having a girlfriend
00:09:35 we clean more consistently
00:09:38 with more consistency every week
00:09:40 every weekend that we are not
00:09:42 away  If we don't go out, if we don't go out at the
00:09:45 weekend, all weekend, we
00:09:48 clean, we clean the room, so in the
00:09:50 end time counts. I don't know if
00:09:53 I spent more time cleaning when I was with a
00:09:55 partner or not, but it is true that the
00:09:58 house is cleaner having  girlfriend the
00:10:00 room and the house the floor is
00:10:03 cleaner because in the end I am not a
00:10:06 very dirty person but I am more of not
00:10:10 dirty than cleaning
00:10:11 I like to be careful not to
00:10:12 dirty pee sitting on
00:10:15 the toilet for  For example, doing things so as
00:10:17 not to get dirty I like it more than having
00:10:20 to clean it later,
00:10:22 but even so, compared to other people
00:10:24 I've seen, compared to the floors of
00:10:26 other people I've been to,
00:10:29 I think I'm not a very dirty person, I
00:10:31 usually clean, well, from time to time  I'm
00:10:33 cleaning but well, even so, now
00:10:35 that I'm with a girlfriend, I notice that in
00:10:37 general I clean more often and the house
00:10:39 is cleaner.
00:10:45 If you go to a
00:10:46 restaurant you can try more things
00:10:49 you can try what you are eating and
00:10:51 you can also try what your partner is not
00:10:53 that good if you go with friends it is the same
00:10:56 this also if you usually go out to dinner
00:10:58 with friends well you also have this
00:11:01 benefit that normally  you can
00:11:03 ask your friends to try what they
00:11:05 have ordered and so you can try
00:11:06 many different dishes
00:11:09 but well at least in my case with a
00:11:12 girlfriend when I have a girlfriend I go to dinner in
00:11:15 more different places and I go out to
00:11:17 dinner more often more often
00:11:19 then  that is a benefit that when
00:11:21 I go out to dinner with her, well, I can
00:11:23 also try what has already been ordered and
00:11:26 that is good, I can try more different types of
00:11:28 food and another thing is a
00:11:31 new perspective on the world, not
00:11:34 because anyone with whom
00:11:37 speak in the end it will have some
00:11:39 differences regarding the way you
00:11:42 think you are not going to think a
00:11:43 little differently
00:11:46 but having a partner having a girlfriend well
00:11:48 it has  You have many discussions with the
00:11:51 same person a lot, you talk about many
00:11:52 things with the same person
00:11:54 many times, because you talk about topics that
00:11:57 perhaps you don't usually talk about with friends,
00:11:59 and you discover that there are things
00:12:02 in life that maybe you didn't know about, not like
00:12:05 me, for example.  I didn't know the importance
00:12:07 of shoes, what variety of
00:12:09 shoes are there, what variety of types of
00:12:11 shoes and the importance of
00:12:14 shoes, for example, or the amount of
00:12:17 soaps and face creams that
00:12:19 exist, now with my girlfriend I have
00:12:22 discovered  that there are a lot more
00:12:24 things that you can put on your face than
00:12:25 the ones I knew about and it's also very
00:12:29 good to have a partner or
00:12:31 travel companion because now when I go out one
00:12:33 day or I go away for the weekend,
00:12:35 I go with my girlfriend  and it is very good to
00:12:38 have someone to talk to along
00:12:40 the way and in general with whom to
00:12:42 discuss the play and well, not only
00:12:45 when you travel, even on a day-to-day basis
00:12:46 when you go to eat or have dinner or something, well,
00:12:50 yes  I'm with my girlfriend so I can
00:12:52 discuss, look, the man with the
00:12:54 toupee looks how ridiculous hahaha I don't know how
00:12:57 to discuss the play in general,
00:12:59 not comment on the interesting things and
00:13:02 he can also make more jokes and such
00:13:03 another reason why I like having a
00:13:07 girlfriend and  Especially why I
00:13:09 like having a girlfriend in winter is that
00:13:12 girlfriends are generally quite
00:13:14 warm, especially in bed in
00:13:16 winter when it's cold because you can
00:13:18 hug each other and it makes you feel warm or not, and that
00:13:21 's very clear unless you live
00:13:23 here.  in thailand here in thailand with
00:13:25 the heat that it is at the end we
00:13:28 touch our little toe and still
00:13:31 thank you and then in the case of some
00:13:34 girlfriends if they have a profession that is
00:13:36 useful if they know how to do something that is useful for
00:13:40 example if they are a doctor  or he is a lawyer or like
00:13:42 my girlfriend
00:13:43 or even better if he works at the
00:13:45 telepizza and can get you
00:13:47 employee discounts because he is very useful
00:13:50 then it is perfect and good if
00:13:53 you have or if you have had a boyfriend  or girlfriend
00:13:55 tell me tell me what is the best thing about having a
00:13:58 boyfriend or girlfriend what do you like the most
00:14:00 about having a boyfriend or girlfriend okay come see you
00:14:04 later
00:14:09 [Music]
",4
13,"00:00:00 today we are in tokyo with what is your name
00:00:04 javier javier enchanted author and
00:00:08 javier is going to talk to us about his country chile
00:00:12 chile yes very good my country
00:00:17 [Music]
00:00:20 hello hello my name is javier yes and
00:00:25 javier is here in tokyo he is living
00:00:28 in japan but javier  it is from chile it has
00:00:31 come from chile
00:00:34 and a very long country and far by the way
00:00:37 very long and very far from japan
00:00:41 it will also be very expensive or come all the way
00:00:43 to japan notice that one might think
00:00:45 that being such a far away place it could
00:00:47 be very expensive but
00:00:50 coming to  Here for a Chilean it can
00:00:52 be expensive when it comes to paying but the
00:00:54 trip itself is not in carbon
00:00:56 the trip is not that expensive it is as expensive as you
00:00:57 notice it's okay so today I want you to
00:01:01 talk to us about Chile because I think that many
00:01:04 people have not been  in chile or you don't
00:01:06 know much about chile then
00:01:09 you have told us that chile is a very
00:01:11 very long long starting country that's why I
00:01:14 think many know it I don't ask
00:01:15 anywhere where are you from I am from
00:01:18 the central part of chile ok
00:01:19 exactly
00:01:21 Being about 100 kilometers from Santiago,
00:01:23 the capital was paradise,
00:01:25 Valparaíso, there it is in the sea, it is also
00:01:30 sensitive, everything is in the sea, it does not look, it
00:01:32 plants kilometers of coast that in
00:01:34 reality everything seems that everything is by the
00:01:36 sea, obviously some cities that
00:01:37 are not in the  great symbol because there
00:01:39 are also mountains, exactly, there are also
00:01:41 mountains, that is, we are bordering the
00:01:43 sea and the Andes mountain range, the
00:01:45 big ones, which are very high mountains, very
00:01:48 high,
00:01:50 so well, and Valparaíso as it is is
00:01:54 a very big city, small, it is not a
00:01:56 city  quite small
00:02:00 I could not compare it right now with a
00:02:02 known one from Japan or from another part of the
00:02:04 world because in reality I am not
00:02:05 entirely sure how much the territory of
00:02:07 Valparaíso is worth but to see it
00:02:10 must be 15 kilometers long 5 km of
00:02:16 course a horseshoe shape comes
00:02:19 from the north
00:02:24 to the north and a port city
00:02:28 has a lot closed in the city that with a
00:02:30 port has many hills those hills
00:02:33 we did not want  the mountains are small and
00:02:35 many people come from
00:02:37 abroad 42 42
00:02:43 and because they live off the people there is our
00:02:46 reality the true descent is very
00:02:48 difficult to go up and down and there are people who do
00:02:50 it every day in the morning and in the
00:02:52 afternoon to see the issue is  that valparaíso
00:02:54 has an extension of territory a
00:02:56 fairly small plain quite
00:02:58 short so there is little space
00:03:05 because it is more expensive to live in the flat part of
00:03:09 course that the time that
00:03:11 commerce is concentrated all the stores
00:03:13 everyone goes shopping of course it will be
00:03:15 more expensive to live there
00:03:18 in chile
00:03:20 you don't need to have a car you need a
00:03:23 car to go anywhere like in
00:03:26 areas i would say
00:03:28 yes and no it depends on the place for
00:03:32 example maybe in santiago for example which is
00:03:34 the capital and most of the
00:03:36 area is even paved  They have a
00:03:39 bike path
00:03:41 as a bike path where the bikes go
00:03:49 for bikes but for example in
00:03:51 Valparaíso there is practically no metro
00:03:57 there is a metro but the metro is a single
00:04:00 line  The line that goes from Valparaíso
00:04:02 inland towards the interior areas of
00:04:04 the region is worth it and is stable because the
00:04:05 Valparaíso region has many
00:04:07 provinces, so it was from the
00:04:09 main province, which in the city of
00:04:10 Valparaíso, to the interior of the
00:04:12 region is called Valparaíso and the
00:04:14 alcaraz city that as the capital of the region
00:04:16 and it turns out that of course the metro goes to
00:04:20 the interior areas and within the
00:04:22 city it does not have a cycle path there
00:04:25 is no metro network of course it is
00:04:27 anywhere and the buses
00:04:29 are not very practical either  buses and they are
00:04:32 practical because they take you to
00:04:34 quite distant places from one city to another and
00:04:36 that in fact the main transport in
00:04:37 Valparaíso
00:04:39 but let's say that there is no such
00:04:42 connection as this minibus meters
00:04:44 I don't know taxi with a stop there is no such
00:04:46 connection minibuses like the buses
00:04:48 here  In Japan, a normal bus or a
00:04:51 little micro is smaller,
00:04:54 it's not a van, it's a little
00:04:57 smaller, although in Chile you have
00:05:00 collections.  tives as they have in Mexico that are
00:05:02 a van dancing to see us in a
00:05:04 van are like taxis values ​​are
00:05:05 called collective taxis
00:05:07 ok so they are as if they were taxis
00:05:08 disappearance of several people ok
00:05:10 but it is a taxi a normal car that
00:05:13 fits five people something very given
00:05:15 Realize that five people are worth but this
00:05:16 sedan collective taxi has lines where
00:05:20 you tell them if the route has not been
00:05:22 made and you get in the taxi with the
00:05:25 people it is cheaper and
00:05:28 always cheaper for everything there is also a taxi
00:05:30 but in Valparaíso - almost  Nobody is
00:05:33 worth it, well, and now with the fever of the
00:05:35 place, for example, from the Caliph and almost
00:05:38 no one
00:05:39 uses a taxi for the bus anymore, many people use Uvero Califa, you
00:05:41 say, and many people have not
00:05:44 prohibited renting it, there have been groceries
00:05:46 and more, many controversies
00:05:48 over the subject
00:05:49 dv turns out that the successes say this
00:05:54 turns out that they are not paying any type
00:05:57 of license license or taxes for
00:06:00 being working and they work the same it
00:06:02 is not until  to the fact that people prefer them
00:06:03 because of various problems with the
00:06:06 taxi drivers and there are also many others who
00:06:07 cross the line a bit so to
00:06:10 speak and charge more in general there
00:06:13 are not many people not many people not many
00:06:16 people like taxi drivers because
00:06:18 Many times there is an artificial way of
00:06:20 limiting how many people can be a taxi driver
00:06:22 so the service is not so good with a
00:06:24 lot of people I would like
00:06:27 that that is the problem how is the weather being
00:06:30 targeted the weather in general has a
00:06:34 Mediterranean climate
00:06:35 but of course it depends on what is received is in the
00:06:37 north or south it is very good in the
00:06:40 north of chile we have the
00:06:42 atacama desert the driest desert in the world
00:06:44 a desert that is more arid it rains
00:06:47 less than in the clear sahara of phoenix
00:06:49 and it is the driest in the world
00:06:51 this is produced by phenomena  climatic conditions
00:06:53 that the center of Chile is where
00:06:56 most of the currents arrive,
00:06:58 but the warm currents
00:07:00 rise and the cold currents fall,
00:07:02 therefore this means that the north  it is
00:07:04 arid the center is temperate due to the
00:07:08 hot and dry air going to the north of course
00:07:10 and all the clouds and low humidity to the
00:07:12 south therefore this convergence occurs
00:07:16 the north is not very arid dry the center is
00:07:19 temperate and the south is very  rainy by
00:07:21 then that causes chile to be like
00:07:24 a country that has a lot of
00:07:27 climate divergence in the north you can find
00:07:28 desert in the center of the city
00:07:29 fill your you can find the river
00:07:31 mountains a
00:07:33 lot of green a lot of nature
00:07:35 and you in valparaiso you grew up living
00:07:39 in a house  or in a flat
00:07:42 a house in a house for his family he
00:07:44 lives he lived in a house like this if
00:07:46 we always live in a house I started living at
00:07:49 my grandparents house when I
00:07:52 was young I still worked so I
00:07:55 was basically raised by my grandfather
00:07:58 at the age of 8  If I remember correctly,
00:08:02 we already moved to our own
00:08:04 house with your parents of abilities in
00:08:07 your own house
00:08:10 and from there it was a house outside
00:08:13 the city within the city outside
00:08:15 the city 30 kilometers from the city
00:08:17 and when we arrived it was a
00:08:19 very
00:08:22 small town three kilometers from valparaíso
00:08:24 and it was a very small town but it was
00:08:28 just being built in fact
00:08:29 in the middle sector joseba it's called the
00:08:32 villa los fundadores ok because it was
00:08:35 practically the first house that
00:08:37 the first colonizers built
00:08:41 , we moved from there
00:08:49 until now when you went you went to the
00:08:52 university of chile
00:08:53 but you went every day from your house
00:08:56 it was not very far there was a house
00:09:03 take one that takes me from my house
00:09:05 to the  even the
00:09:08 independent university yes yes it is quite practical
00:09:11 if one hour in total is not good and
00:09:14 where you lived it is easy to go to the sea and from
00:09:17 the mountains
00:09:18 I will see
00:09:20 how I lived
00:09:22 practically next to the sea
00:09:25 it was not easy to get to the mountains it was
00:09:29 easy  but it takes you on time and we
00:09:30 need a vehicle if it takes us
00:09:35 an hour two hours
00:09:38 at best an hour or so to get to
00:09:41 the boat it was not very far the
00:09:44 connection and  It's a bit complicated
00:09:46 but it's not that difficult
00:09:47 and it's good to get to the sea in half an
00:09:50 hour and 20 minutes. Half an hour to get to
00:09:54 where I lived, the sea is worth adding, nice
00:09:57 if it continues, it's nice, although you have to keep
00:10:00 in mind that it seems as it is  a
00:10:01 port city most of
00:10:03 the coastline is taken over by the port
00:10:04 ok there is a port and there are not many
00:10:06 beaches of course there
00:10:08 is practically no beach there is practically no there
00:10:10 are a couple of beaches and why is there the
00:10:12 port and a couple of beaches like in this
00:10:14 sector is up to the port here a couple of
00:10:15 beaches like here
00:10:17 valparaíso on the city of viña
00:10:19 del mar is a spa so many
00:10:23 beaches most of the spa that there is
00:10:25 hot water thermal water
00:10:28 there are many beaches
00:10:33 because people go to bathe
00:10:36 exactly then it turns out  That the
00:10:38 people who are from Valparaíso if they want to go
00:10:40 to the beach have to go there to the sea
00:10:41 because help is all over the beach and it's
00:10:43 much more it's a more touristy city it's
00:10:46 much prettier prettier  that
00:10:50 the hit awaits him has its
00:10:52 finite beauty and from where you lived you could
00:10:55 go skiing or snowboarding
00:10:58 if you could but it took a while, it
00:11:02 was about the same as it takes to go to the
00:11:04 mountains because you had to get to the
00:11:08 Cordillera de los Andes
00:11:09 in the sections more or less because you
00:11:11 were next to the sea you had to
00:11:12 get to the thunder where the
00:11:15 mountain was but you could go in the morning and
00:11:17 in the afternoon yes or
00:11:20 yes you can do a day trip for
00:11:22 For example, although many people stay
00:11:24 weekends
00:11:25 due to logistics, it is much better
00:11:27 if it is handled for only one day and you want to
00:11:30 make the most of the time and you stay, it
00:11:31 arrives very clearly for her in Chile.
00:11:39 the
00:11:42 clothing that it has as part if
00:11:44 you have to have your own material or
00:11:46 rent it you can rent it but they
00:11:49 still tried so it costs more than
00:11:51 if you already have it and
00:11:54 what are you what is your favorite place in
00:11:57 xela
00:11:58 in chile my favorite place is look
00:12:00 at where i live
00:12:03 there is an artificial water reservoir
00:12:07 an artificial lake that was formerly a
00:12:09 reservoir worth a compress of course of course in the
00:12:13 past this is already active it
00:12:15 is not used for practically a reservoir to
00:12:17 me  I really like cycling, it's worth going
00:12:19 by bike, of course, not
00:12:21 mountain biking, but yes, how to go downhill, not
00:12:24 like hiking, it's okay with dirt roads,
00:12:26 exactly with a mountain bike, of
00:12:28 course, a mountain, so it turns out that
00:12:30 this lake has a whole route
00:12:34 around you.  It can go all the way around and
00:12:36 so every time I could, even during the
00:12:38 week, if given the
00:12:40 opportunity, I liked to go there and remember
00:12:42 everything after school or after
00:12:44 work. Claudia because he was going to finish
00:12:46 work, he was also on time or
00:12:47 On weekends during the morning,
00:12:49 for example, then I really liked
00:12:52 the remote areas where I lived
00:12:54 because there was that lake and there was another.
00:12:56 The sectors far from one could
00:12:57 easily go by bicycle for how many
00:13:00 kilometers it will be around the lake
00:13:03 114 kilometers around quite
00:13:07 a bit you can be quite handy
00:13:09 for a while and it remains you could
00:13:11 stay there for a while well
00:13:13 and the other sectors the other areas
00:13:15 where  you went that it was forest it was surrounded
00:13:19 by continental
00:13:22 there was asphalt or asphalt but it was as if
00:13:25 surrounded by trees it was like a rural sector it
00:13:26 was all the forest around and
00:13:30 what do you miss most about chile
00:13:33 being here in japan living in japan
00:13:35 and being here in japan  I would say that what
00:13:37 I miss the most about Chile are its flavors,
00:13:39 the flavor of the food,
00:13:43 and I think there are flavors that are
00:13:44 difficult to replicate here,
00:13:48 one can emulate them, but not
00:13:50 replicate them on Sunday, not because I don't know
00:13:52 much about Chilean food, but what kind
00:13:55 of flavors or what kind of ingredients you
00:13:57 can't find here or it costs,
00:14:00 for example, in Chile they usually use a
00:14:04 lot what the corn for the
00:14:08 big corn that  It is called choclero which is
00:14:10 a corn in various shapes these bullets
00:14:14 so there I don't know if only in
00:14:17 Chile but over there in the summer
00:14:19 a corn grows that is gigantic as
00:14:20 information large giant corn
00:14:22 a very large cob of course exactly
00:14:25 so with that we make dishes
00:14:28 There, for example, we call corn cake,
00:14:29 which is basically like
00:14:32 meat with a meat base with that
00:14:36 sweet corn on top of sugar, which is
00:14:39 corn, as it removes all the teeth from
00:14:44 corn, it is ground.
00:14:46 Preparation with
00:14:48 sugar is sweet Ladero is then poured into the
00:14:50 oven with sugar so it is worth
00:14:51 security but in case you are sweet and
00:14:54 salty the same combination of flavors
00:14:56 because in Spain we do not usually make
00:14:58 sweet food with sugar to the food
00:15:01 in fact those are typical foods
00:15:03 summer just like what the
00:15:05 pretty ones have, for example, and basically that
00:15:07 same corn is wrapped in the same
00:15:10 sheet where the corn comes from and it is thrown into
00:15:12 the olive  It is made in the pot with the
00:15:15 manterola leaf and the ground corn is wrapped in
00:15:18 the circus that has been evaluated and put in
00:15:21 the saucepan
00:15:22 and that is also with sugar
00:15:24 [Music] to
00:15:27 find and it says here the sea was not based much
00:15:30 and there is no equal  It's not the same here and
00:15:32 it doesn't get much here I've seen it in
00:15:34 salads in some salad but it was
00:15:37 used a lot,
00:15:39 well, thank you, thank you for
00:15:41 explaining to us a little about chili
00:15:47 and I hope that the people who
00:15:52 watch the video will also find it interesting and  want to

00:00:02 tell you something that has happened to him, a
00:00:03 story that has happened to him, and Carlos, to know,
00:00:06 Carlos is foul-mouthed, he says a lot of
00:00:08 swear words, a lot of insults, and
00:00:10 so on
00:00:14 .  It's funny and you want to
00:00:16 learn swear words in Spanish, so
00:00:19 you can listen to the story, the
00:00:21 story of Carlos III, let's
00:00:23 see what it tells us
00:00:28 [Music]
00:00:31 god god god god god [ __ ] [ __ ]
00:00:34 [ __ ] I just got hit by the
00:00:37 car I just hit myself  a host that you
00:00:40 freak out and I'm driving so calmly
00:00:43 and an [ __ ] has invaded my lane he
00:00:46 has gotten into my lane and I had to
00:00:48 dodge him and I ended up going off the
00:00:50 road and I
00:00:52 hit a [ __ ] tree against a tree the [ __ ] tree he was doing
00:00:55 and the  shitty tree the mother who
00:00:58 gave birth to the tree who commanded the tree
00:01:00 was there and well my car was
00:01:03 totally wrecked and can't be repaired and
00:01:06 then the other [ __ ] gets out of the
00:01:08 car and blames me  í and he says that
00:01:11 it was my fault he says that if I go ta ha
00:01:13 that if I go ta ha you even jasso
00:01:15 bastard what are you doing getting into my
00:01:17 total lane that we have started to give each other
00:01:19 [ __ ] and in the end the police have come and
00:01:22 have taken us  At the police station we spent
00:01:24 the whole night at the police station and it turns out
00:01:26 that in the end the 2 roofs were going to me
00:01:29 they have taken 6 points from
00:01:31 my driving license they have taken half of me and they
00:01:33 have fined me 500 euros
00:01:36 because I had only drunk a couple of
00:01:38 Cuban drinks and well and that and the
00:01:41 total loss of the car and since I am a clingy person, well,
00:01:43 insurance to third parties that the insurance is
00:01:45 not going to cover me at
00:01:47 all, it is not going to pay me anything, it is not going to pay me a penny and well
00:01:50 and the other the other  He has it worse
00:01:52 because he had drunk that one when
00:01:54 when they made him blow he gave it through
00:01:57 the clouds and I saw him there all nervous
00:02:00 I think he had gotten
00:02:01 snow or something and I think he's going to
00:02:04 touch him at least  He is going to play three months in
00:02:07 the trena and for at least a year without a license
00:02:10 p  Or at least, but hey, he already
00:02:12 deserves everything, it was because of that bastard, if it
00:02:14 weren't for him, if it weren't for that payment,
00:02:16 I would go home without any
00:02:18 problem.
00:02:24 No one beats it, so you know if you
00:02:27 are professionals behind the wheel like me, well,
00:02:29 drink and drive, nothing happens,
00:02:32 but don't get caught by the cops or don't get
00:02:35 hit by any bastard like this,
00:02:37 well, well, well, you see, don't pay
00:02:40 attention to him.  nothing of what he has said
00:02:43 do not pay attention to anything that you have already
00:02:44 what has happened to him for drinking and driving
