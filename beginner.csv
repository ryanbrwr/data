00:10:49 is from mikael they are mikael's flowers for
00:10:53 paula but paula is not sure she is not
00:10:58 sure if  Is she happy or not because
00:11:01 when she is when she is with mikael
00:11:04 when they talk together when they are together
00:11:06 she feels good but she is afraid she is not
00:11:12 afraid of course but noelia thinks she

00:01:43 to me always  It seemed to me something very

00:01:54 the sun is here, the sun is here, the earth is here,
00:01:58 the earth is the blue planet, the earth is
00:02:01 not
00:02:03 here
00:02:06 and the earth revolves
00:02:09 around the sun and well, like
00:02:14 fireworks,
00:02:17 nine fireworks,
00:02:22 but of course it is  very arbitrary because
00:02:26 exactly here why not here
00:02:33 or here or not here
00:02:34 then it is very arbitrary but well and

00:05:13 if this year well right now
00:05:17 something big something very
00:05:20 important is happening with  dreaming is paris
00:05:23 and i hope in a short time powerful
00:05:26 explain what is happening
00:05:30 well it's not a baby it's not a baby it's
00:05:34 not personal things it's not
00:05:38 my personal things yes at some point we will have
00:05:41 a baby but no well you never know no
00:05:45 but well we are thinking that we
00:05:49 would like it but maybe
00:05:52 maybe more I don't know 2022 or 2023 it would be more
00:05:59 realistic to have a baby right now
00:06:07 for now it's something it's something from dreaming
00:06:09 spanish it's not my personal thing
00:06:13 hopefully Camilo what's up uncle Camilo says
00:06:21 something personal for 2021  It's that I'm going to
00:06:25 get married again
00:06:28 we did the ceremony we did the
00:06:30 wedding not so so so we got married in
00:06:35 Spain'
00:06:37 the year
00:06:40 yes last year in 2020 and this year
00:06:43 we are going to do the seeing Kobe here
00:06:48 in Thailand  day we are going to hold the
00:06:50 celebration in thailand
00:06:52 depending a bit on kobe no
00:06:56 because kobe
00:06:58 like bill 19
00:07:02 depending on kobe
00:07:04 well it cannot be that it has to be
00:07:07 left for later
00:07:10 here in thailand
00:07:14 in thailand we have been lucky so
00:07:18 far there has been no  many cases of kobe
00:07:23 but now they have begun to see more they have
00:07:27 begun to see more a question of
00:07:30 a clue a clue of what is going to happen
00:07:32 with dream in spanish
00:07:35 well a clue is that there are going to be more
00:07:40 people more more people
00:07:46 more people
00:07:49 working working in dreaming
00:07:52 spanish
00:07:54 then
00:07:57 in thailand now right now he has
00:08:00 started to see more kobe
00:08:03 almost a year after it started no
00:08:07 so let's see
00:08:09 camilo yes of course i'm going to marry him again
00:08:12 with the same the same woman
00:08:18 so now cobit is  going up in
00:08:21 thailand but before there were already a
00:08:25 few cases and then it went down and it already
00:08:28 disappeared or not
00:08:30 let's see let's see if this time again
00:08:33 like beat well it goes
00:08:39 up goes up and then goes down again  once and
00:08:42 it disappears well if we can have
00:08:47 the wedding he
00:08:50 says that you don't hear well you don't hear me well
00:08:58 well I say it I say it well
00:09:01 I'm not saying there's any
00:09:03 problem
00:09:06 then yes we'll see we're
00:09:09 going to do it in
00:09:11 April
00:09:14 in April
00:09:18 Well, we'll see if not, then
00:09:20 later if not due to problems with the cob
00:09:25 and we ca
00:09:29 n't, it happens to us later we'll get married
00:09:32 the audio is stopping if it stops it
00:09:37 will be a problem
00:09:42 with youtube the sound chops
00:09:47 I'm going to try listening to myself  a little let's
00:09:49 see if I understand what's going on it
00:10:00 seems that
00:10:04 I don't touch anything quite well it's here everything the same
00:10:07 everything connected it cuts off several times in
00:10:10 each sentence
00:10:12 it says still now now it's
00:10:15 cutting off it
00:10:18 seems that from time to time I know
00:10:21 it cuts off a bit
00:10:22 I don't think I can do anything, it
00:10:29 will depend a little on the Internet on the
00:10:31 speed of the Internet.
00:10:34 I can turn off the Wi-Fi,
00:10:39 well, I'm going to try a little more
00:10:43 and there are still problems,
00:10:46 some problem, I'll ask my wife to
00:10:50 stop d  and watch
00:10:52 netflix to stop watching the series
00:10:57 and
00:10:58 that
00:11:00 the new year we have just started 2021
00:11:05 for all those who thought that kobe 19
00:11:10 was something from
00:11:15 2020 given that they have almost realized
00:11:20 that in 2021
00:11:24 we are still with a kobe  that it has not
00:11:26 magically disappeared just because
00:11:31 the number of the year has changed
00:11:33 and well we are going to have to endure
00:11:37 endure a little longer wear
00:11:39 the mask
00:11:43 with the nose inside a little longer
00:11:46 and wait for them to vaccinate us to vaccinate us
00:11:50 not today today  They have given my mother the vaccine to my mother
00:11:55 they have put her to
00:11:59 see what a syringe looks like
00:12:02 like this to my mother they have given her the first
00:12:05 dose of the vaccine they have given her the
00:12:11 what is happening you are
00:12:15 you are
00:12:19 joking all right
00:12:22 and that  My mother received the
00:12:25 first dose of the vaccine. My mother
00:12:29 works in a hospital. She
00:12:32 is in a hospital.
00:12:37 Maybe
00:12:42 my mother works in a hospital, so they
00:12:46 are the people who receive the vaccine first,
00:12:52 and well little by little during the year 2021.
00:12:57 We will see that more and
00:13:01 more people are going to receive the
00:13:04 vaccine,
00:13:06 Camilo says face masks and I think that in
00:13:08 Latin America they call them face masks or
00:13:11 in Spain we call them a
00:13:14 mask,
00:13:18 yes, well, we will have to continue
00:13:20 wearing it for a while
00:13:25 and that, well, 2021, we will continue.  with
00:13:29 kobe
00:13:35 js bach question to teach with 6 with
00:13:40 convergent comprehensible input boca
00:13:45 search on facebook look in groups groups
00:13:49 of teachers on facebook
00:13:52 on facebook search for tves
00:13:56 s
00:13:58 etc. and you will see that there are many
00:14:01 resources for teachers who teach with
00:14:04 comprehensible input
00:14:08 what happened let's talk  a bit about what
00:14:11 happened in 2020
00:14:14 with I don't know in dream with dream in spanish
00:14:19 what happened with dream in spanish
00:14:23 we started making daily
00:14:27 advanced level videos we didn't
00:14:30 start making advanced videos
00:14:33 and well I think there are quite a few people
00:14:35 who are  watching
00:14:39 also tell me your opinion if
00:14:41 you watch the advanced videos
00:14:46 what happens here
00:14:49 insert ads can insert
00:14:51 ads  ios well I can put it's an ad
00:14:54 I don't want to put an ad I want
00:15:03 that we start the advanced videos
00:15:06 we start the conversations that every
00:15:09 week we have a conversation
00:15:13 and we start well the web the web I
00:15:18 haven't started talking a lot about the
00:15:20 web yet not the web right
00:15:22 now  right now it is still
00:15:25 in beta it is still a beta it is not yet
00:15:28 complete no but if you want to
00:15:31 try it it is in driving it is paris
00:15:35 from me
00:15:37 disparate
00:15:43 and right now it is an
00:15:49 easier way to see the videos than on
00:15:51 youtube because you can see them for every
00:15:54 Professor
00:15:56 for Spanish from Spain or Spanish from
00:15:58 Latin America you can see it by topic
00:16:01 if you like history videos
00:16:03 you can only see history videos
00:16:09 it is not yet a complete website for
00:16:12 people who do not know the method, do not
00:16:15 know the comprehensible input or do not
00:16:18 know dreaming  spanish It is still
00:16:21 not very clear how to use the web,
00:16:24 but for you who already know it, I
00:16:29 think you can start using it
00:16:33 and take advantage of it.
00:16:37 what happened to the world in 2020 what
00:16:41 happened in 2020 of course
00:16:46 lakovic
00:16:48 there were there were fires there were many
00:16:50 fires in california fires in
00:16:54 australia there
00:16:56 was also the explosion in beirut not the big
00:17:01 explosion
00:17:04 the explosion in the port in the port
00:17:06 of beirut
00:17:08 what else happened
00:17:11 In Spain there hasn't been anything like this,
00:17:14 historically, very big.
00:17:17 Well, in the US, but in the United States,
00:17:20 the elections went up. Let's
00:17:27 see what you say to me,
00:17:29 or ahgai, what's up, guy? I know him,
00:17:32 I know him in person, we've seen them here
00:17:35 in Bangkok.
00:17:38 topic would be the
00:17:41 current state of dream in spanish
00:17:45 my goals of dream in spanish well
00:17:48 my goals of dream in spanish I
00:17:51 can tell you now and my goals is to
00:17:54 have a good platform a
00:17:59 platform in which anyone
00:18:01 even if they know 0 even if they don't know anything about
00:18:05 Spanish you can enter
00:18:08 you feel like you have made friends in
00:18:12 Spanish you have to meet friends
00:18:15 who always speak Spanish to you have
00:18:18 some I would say about 2000 hours
00:18:23 2000 hours  s of videos
00:18:27 in the future also maybe to be able to
00:18:30 read and such
00:18:33 later expand to other languages
00:18:37 teach French German English Chinese
00:18:42 Japanese
00:18:44 in the future if we can then
00:18:47 smaller more minority languages
00:18:52 and yes js js vaart 96 how do you want me to
00:18:59 say your name your name  it's hard
00:19:01 js i don't know vaart i call you vaart you can
00:19:06 call vaart like the bar season
00:19:11 yes something that a lot of people do is
00:19:14 resolutions new years resolutions
00:19:19 well their goals for the new years
00:19:22 for the year 2020 i normally don't usually do
00:19:28 n't usually choose
00:19:30 to resolutions  new year
00:19:33 but I do have objectives to
00:19:36 learn languages ​​I always have some
00:19:39 objective to learn languages ​​right
00:19:43 now I am
00:19:46 perhaps the sun the sun here it is no longer necessary to
00:19:51 erase the sun
00:19:55 so
00:20:04 I am learning now
00:20:09 I continue with the Thai to see if
00:20:12 I can do the  flag of thailand without making a
00:20:15 mistake
00:20:24 I have some I have something
00:20:27 I think it is like that it is sorry if I
00:20:29 am wrong
00:20:32 I think this is the flag of thailand
00:20:38 lake  black at the end so that
00:20:40 the two colors don't mix
00:20:44 thai right
00:20:46 now the thai stays
00:20:51 a little behind in the background
00:20:56 but because
00:20:59 we do watch series we watch netflix
00:21:02 with my wife
00:21:04 oh it doesn't seem like it has antennas
00:21:08 or like that but not
00:21:10 one  the antenna is not worth
00:21:11 it we watch television with my wife
00:21:15 we ​​watch netflix series so we watch them
00:21:18 in thai and i live in
00:21:21 thailand and every day i continue to use a
00:21:24 little thai so i already know that my
00:21:28 thai will continue to improve i don't have
00:21:30 to try very hard
00:21:33 so i  I really want to make an effort
00:21:37 with him, if not, not
00:21:38 with Chinese,
00:21:40 yes,
00:21:42 I'm going to do it. White, although it's really red,
00:21:45 and Chinese is the
00:21:49 one I spend the
00:21:52 most time
00:21:57 with.
00:22:03 languages ​​like this in parallel
00:22:08 but
00:22:10 now my Thai is pretty good you
00:22:14 can listen to podcasts for example go
00:22:17 listening to potash with it on your mobile
00:22:21 and when I'm away from home
00:22:24 I can  I'm still learning Thai,
00:22:28 Chinese, no, my level of Chinese is low,
00:22:32 quite low,
00:22:35 so I'm still listening to podcasts,
00:22:40 I don't learn much, I don't learn very fast,
00:22:44 that's
00:22:48 why I prefer to learn Chinese
00:22:51 only when I sit down, I can
00:22:55 sit down and I can concentrate, I can
00:22:58 concentrate on watching something in  watch a
00:23:01 series watch videos or something
00:23:06 to see what you say
00:23:09 or the trowel no longer says that she
00:23:12 and her daughter are fans very well
00:23:14 oh
00:23:16 what resources are there for Chinese for Chinese right
00:23:20 now I am mostly using
00:23:22 netflix
00:23:26 netflix well I think for many
00:23:29 languages ​​is amazing there are many
00:23:32 resources
00:23:35 to improve but yes your level has
00:23:38 to be quite good
00:23:41 on netflix i have finished watching all
00:23:45 all the episodes of pocoyo
00:23:51 now i am looking at pepe
00:24:00 and started to watch charly as
00:24:02 is charly
00:24:06 charly color color forms
00:24:12 something  this is also
00:24:16 some drawings some very simple very
00:24:20 simple cartoons that talk about shapes
00:24:24 a round square this is not a
00:24:27 square one round one square one
00:24:31 triangle and the colors are very simple
00:24:36 I'm going to continue with this I'm going to continue
00:24:38 watching drawings on netflix and then
00:24:43 crosstalk doing cross such that it's the
00:24:46 most important thing right now
00:24:53 [Music]
00:24:55 so matheus says he understands my Spanish
00:24:58 on 50  I suppose you mean 50
00:25:02 percent, not 50%, very good, that's
00:25:07 fine,
00:25:09 what am I going to do in 2021? In 2021, I'm going to
00:25:14 continue with Thai, it would be fine
00:25:17 by the end of 2021. It's
00:25:23 not known. Maybe about 2,000, about 2,000,
00:25:29 two thousand words.  in Chinese knowing about two
00:25:33 thousand words in Chinese
00:25:36 this has been left out
00:25:40 having learned about two thousand words in
00:25:44 Chinese would be good
00:25:48 I don't think that by the end of 2021 I will be able to
00:25:53 understand television well for this it
00:25:56 will still take a little longer
00:25:59 but
00:26:01 so  during 2001 2021 I think
00:26:07 my level of Chinese will already be good enough
00:26:11 to make calls make videos
00:26:15 video calls
00:26:17 with the laptop
00:26:20 talk to people
00:26:25 talk to people talk to
00:26:27 me mind but do cro  ss such but
00:26:30 without drawing not having to draw
00:26:33 so I have reached an
00:26:36 intermediate intermediate level because now they
00:26:40 can only speak to me in Chinese and
00:26:43 we can well have a conversation no
00:26:46 I think that in 2021 yes I can
00:26:50 learn Chinese to be able to understand
00:26:53 someone a person  who only speaks
00:26:56 Chinese
00:27:00 bar asks if there is any reason
00:27:04 why I am learning Chinese well
00:27:07 if it is not the most spoken language in the
00:27:11 world not
00:27:13 in the world well let's see they speak Chinese
00:27:16 of course in China
00:27:21 they speak Chinese in Taiwan they speak  in
00:27:23 singapore but of course there are also many
00:27:26 people who speak it
00:27:29 in malaysia in indonesia there are also
00:27:32 many people in the usa who speak it many
00:27:36 people there are people in spain
00:27:38 there are also chinese in spain and
00:27:41 anywhere in the world you
00:27:44 can meet people from china
00:27:48 and yes  The truth is
00:27:52 that since 2000
00:27:56 2009 I'm sure that in 2009
00:28:01 in 2009 I already started to study Chinese a little bit
00:28:04 I started with a book with a book
00:28:10 an exercise book I didn't learn  a lot
00:28:14 because it's very boring I think I did
00:28:17 exercises three times three days and
00:28:21 that's it because it's very boring
00:28:25 but after 2009 well I went to Japan
00:28:31 I started learning Japanese
00:28:35 and then I learned a lot of French and
00:28:39 then Thai and
00:28:42 I've been waiting for a long time waiting
00:28:45 to be able to learn Chinese then yes
00:28:48 I want to learn Chinese no
00:28:56 j big questions if there are
00:29:00 beginner level videos
00:29:03 on my youtube channel
00:29:05 no in pattern no no right now no because
00:29:10 beginner level videos
00:29:12 and
00:29:14 well super beginner no and then
00:29:17 beginners
00:29:20 are very difficult  they are quite difficult
00:29:23 to do they take a long time so
00:29:27 I can't do one every day it would be
00:29:30 even difficult to do more to do one
00:29:33 or two more every week it would be a bit
00:29:37 a bit difficult but well this year this
00:29:43 year is going to be different it's going to be a bit
00:29:47 a  little different
00:30:06 well I hope I hope this year I don't know if
00:30:10 this year I may be it may be
00:30:13 this year or if not maybe by 2020
00:30:19 well there will be  Damn there are many more
00:30:23 level videos so they survive the
00:30:26 beginner
00:30:30 if you never ask me about Hungarian I
00:30:33 have met
00:30:36 people I
00:30:46 have met people
00:30:50 from Hungary
00:30:54 I have met
00:31:01 I have met people who are learning
00:31:03 Hungarian
00:31:05 I don't know it seems clear to me a person may
00:31:09 have an interest in the country  specifically
00:31:12 sure and that will always be in
00:31:14 any country me without having any
00:31:17 connection with hungary and such
00:31:20 I have no reason to learn
00:31:26 hungarian it has never caught my attention
00:31:33 never has never seemed interesting to me
00:31:37 michael what is my job my job is
00:31:40 this  I only do this I only do
00:31:45 dreaming Spanish so I'm
00:31:48 making videos or I'm coordinating that
00:31:52 the other teachers make videos for
00:31:55 our employer or I'm
00:31:57 programming the dream in
00:31:59 Spanish website so for two
00:32:04 years now for two years I've
00:32:07 only been working in entry  mean spanish before he
00:32:10 was a web programmer he wrote websites he didn't
00:32:14 write for him for the computer
00:32:19 web pages I programmed web pages with
00:32:22 javascript and such
00:32:26 and create videos for now I am not going to create
00:32:29 videos in other languages ​​but if this
00:32:33 2021 and 2022 plan goes well, it
00:32:41 may be that in the future
00:32:43 we will make other languages
00:32:46 I will not appear  In the
00:32:50 videos I am not going to record the videos
00:32:54 speaking Japanese I prefer to find

00:34:26 but now
00:34:31 that's it tell me what your
00:34:34 resolutions
00:34:39 are  more
00:34:41 I have other resolutions good to
00:34:45 continue as before me this year this
00:34:50 year I would say that I have behaved quite
00:34:52 well this year I have started to
00:35:01 exercise exercise more regularly more
00:35:04 consistently
00:35:07 and I want to continue I want to continue with that
00:35:09 this year in 2020 eaten  in a healthier way healthier
00:35:22 this yes I have eaten in a healthier way
00:35:26 and I would like to continue I would like to continue
00:35:29 with that there is one thing that I do not drink
00:35:32 enough water I should drink more
00:35:34 water
00:35:38 and that especially here in Thailand
00:35:42 you sweat a lot you sweat  enough and I would have
00:35:46 to drink more water
00:35:48 look at my resolution for 2021 is to drink
00:35:52 more water
00:35:55 what resolutions do you have speak better
00:35:58 languages ​​good  yes of course we all
00:36:02 want to speak more languages ​​and talk
00:36:07 make more friends oysters well I
00:36:10 'm going to take
00:36:12 you I'm going to take that resolution because I
00:36:15 need friends I need more friends here
00:36:18 at the bank I have very few friends friends
00:36:25 [Music]
00:36:27 and he says I've finished all the
00:36:31 harry potter books in spanish and then add
00:36:34 300 hours
00:36:37 good for june having added 300 hours
00:36:40 is more or less two hours two hours a
00:36:44 day
00:36:46 is fine it is a goal that is very
00:36:48 good it is quite good and you can
00:36:51 learn a language quite quickly with
00:36:53 two hours  an average day
00:36:58 of listening or reading very much
00:37:02 a question about the patriotic pattern I
00:37:05 have not activated the annual payments no in
00:37:09 fact you can't right now you can't
00:37:11 pay for a whole year
00:37:15 I don't like annual subscriptions
00:37:18 because I don't know if netflix for example
00:37:22 netflix told me pablo you have to
00:37:24 pay for a whole year well
00:37:27 i don't know if i don't know if in may i
00:37:30 'll still continue watching netflix or not
00:37:33 so i think it's better to
00:37:36 pay for each month to have  to pay for
00:37:39 each month so you know that if you no
00:37:44 longer want to continue or if solving Spanish
00:37:47 goes badly it gets worse and we don't
00:37:52 offer the same level of
00:37:54 quality well you can say goodbye and if
00:37:58 you say goodbye we already know
00:38:02 we have  we need to improve something no
00:38:06 I don't know we are in May and we say good
00:38:10 dreaming spanish is making money it
00:38:13 is not making money because many
00:38:15 people have subscribed for a whole
00:38:18 year well now but we don't know if the
00:38:22 new videos are yes the new videos that
00:38:25 are coming out each video yes  the videos
00:38:28 are good they are of good quality because a
00:38:31 lot of people good because we don't
00:38:36 know people have stopped watching they have stopped
00:38:38 paying or not because until the end of the
00:38:42 year they can't they can't cancel their
00:38:44 subscription I don't think it makes more
00:38:46 sense month by month  and month by month
00:38:53 because we have more
00:38:55 ford form tells you I want to watch and
00:39:00 understand the paper
00:39:04 house without subtitles paper house without subtitles how
00:39:07 long can it take to understand
00:39:10 paper house  without subtitles
00:39:15 I think a thousand hours a thousand hours is
00:39:17 fine a thousand thousand hours of Spanish
00:39:21 viewed I think it is a good level
00:39:24 to understand the paper house
00:39:33 where we are
00:39:35 and learn a little
00:39:38 German I never found German a very
00:39:40 interesting language but  Lately I'm
00:39:44 thinking about it again maybe in the future
00:39:48 maybe after learning Chinese Chinese
00:39:52 Portuguese and after Portuguese
00:39:55 I have to think about what I'm going to
00:39:57 learn I'm going to learn German I'm going to
00:40:00 learn Hindi I don't know I'm not sure
00:40:06 and what else to improve my Italian and
00:40:09 Portuguese  speak and understand Spanish
00:40:12 spend a thousand hours to see a thousand hours of
00:40:16 listening in Spanish go by and you're at 375 well
00:40:23 50
00:40:25 here is stupid
00:40:27 50 km
00:40:30 well a thousand hours a thousand hours of Spanish in
00:40:34 2021 is a very ambitious goal
00:40:40 nothing happens if you don't reach a thousand  hours
00:40:42 because from 375 to 1,375 hours to 1,000,
00:40:49 how many are 625?
00:40:54 Well, it's more or less two hours, two
00:40:57 hours a day, a little less than two
00:41:00 hours a day,
00:41:01 and it's okay. I think it's a goal,
00:41:03 keep going.  It's ok it's achievable it's not it's not
00:41:06 impossible by any means
00:41:09 but run 50 kilometers 50 km
00:41:15 run
00:41:22 but he says keep the habit
00:41:25 of learning Spanish to do something in
00:41:28 Spanish every day very well me too
00:41:30 above all I want to keep
00:41:33 things in 2021 keep the habits
00:41:40 ah
00:41:42 I drink less yerba mate in Thailand
00:41:45 I never never drink yerba mate I
00:41:49 have never prepared my own mate
00:41:52 whenever I have drunk mate it has been
00:41:54 because someone else has prepared it and
00:41:56 has given me mate but I have never bought
00:41:59 I have never prepared mate from  boat
00:42:02 so i drink a lot
00:42:05 down the deer ask what is my favorite language i
00:42:09 don't know it's difficult my favorite language because
00:42:12 of how it sounds because of the sound
00:42:19 for now italian
00:42:23 portuguese good portuguese portugal or brazil italian
00:42:26 maybe brazilian portuguese more italian
00:42:28 portuguese
00:42:31 a language that I like  like how it sounds how it
00:42:34 sounds
00:42:36 korean
00:42:38 korean is very funny areal me it
00:42:42 's the sound i don't know if i really
00:42:45 like korean i'm not interested
00:42:48 m  It doesn't seem like a very
00:42:50 interesting language to me to learn, not for my
00:42:54 tastes, but how does it sound when I hear
00:42:56 people speak Korean? It's funny, hahaha,
00:42:59 funny,
00:43:01 so yes, I think that Italian,
00:43:03 Portuguese, and Korean are the ones that
00:43:06 seem most interesting to me when I hear them.
00:43:09 beautiful
00:43:13 what else is there
00:43:16 to speak spanish
00:43:19 naturally harry potter books level c1
00:43:25 finish exams always er one hundred years
00:43:28 of solitude i have i don't have it i don't think
00:43:32 i don't have the book of one hundred years of
00:43:33 solitude but i should read it it's a
00:43:36 book i should should read  It is a very
00:43:39 famous book not in Spanish
00:43:42 what else
00:43:46 sc but it is expensive to pay each month it
00:43:49 is expensive to pay each time
00:43:53 dollars it is a lot of content I think that
00:43:55 nothing there is nothing so for this value there
00:43:58 is nothing so so cheap on the internet
00:44:02 too  You have videos for
00:44:04 native speakers It is obvious that your videos are very
00:44:06 funny Videos for native speakers
00:44:11 and videos in Spanish for people from
00:44:15 Spain for people from Latin America
00:44:18 no no because there are already many and there are many
00:44:21 channels
00:44:23 of any topic that I
00:44:27 know of, the louder the volume I can turn up the
00:44:29 volume
00:44:30 I'm going to try
00:44:33 I've turned up the volume a bit tell me if it
00:44:36 's too loud if there's a lot of noise and
00:44:39 I'll turn it down again  low
00:44:42 then videos in spanish if i made
00:44:46 videos in spanish they wouldn't be videos like this
00:44:50 drawing they would be videos
00:44:54 about languages ​​videos motivating
00:44:57 people to learn languages ​​explaining
00:45:00 the method comprehensible input how to
00:45:04 learn other languages ​​it wouldn't be a bit
00:45:06 like a channel like polyglots on youtube
00:45:11 like  oli richards and local anne marie lo
00:45:13 and steve huffman but speaking spanish
00:45:17 for spanish speakers who perhaps
00:45:19 haven't learned english yet or don't
00:45:23 speak english well no i wouldn't make videos
00:45:25 like that about history
00:45:28 telling stories and such in spanish
00:45:31 because i think there are other channels that do it
00:45:34 They do better on each subject because it will be
00:45:37 more interesting. It is someone who knows that they
00:45:40 really know a lot about the subject.
00:45:45 What else are you going to do? Travel to Spain very well.
00:45:49 Let's see if it improves if the cob improves and
00:45:52 not
00:45:55 meditating every day to one or meditating without
00:46:00 meditating is complicated I have
00:46:02 tried meditating in the past but
00:46:06 I have never gotten into the
00:46:08 habit of doing it every day and
00:46:11 seeing benefits  to see how my life improves I
00:46:14 don't expect to try again in the future
00:46:17 to see if I can
00:46:24 watch snooker he asks me when
00:46:27 did you start this channel it was difficult to speak
00:46:30 slowly and express myself with difficult words
00:46:35 it was not it was not very difficult because
00:46:38 before I started with  dream in spanish i
00:46:43 had already done more or less 500 500 hours
00:46:47 doing crosstalk doing speaking in
00:46:50 spanish or speaking
00:46:51 [Music]
00:46:54 in japanese or speaking english work well
00:46:57 several languages ​​french also speaking
00:46:59 speaking in one language and that the other
00:47:01 person spoke to me in thai or in
00:47:04 Chinese I had also done 500 hours
00:47:08 of I had 500 hours of experience
00:47:10 speaking in an easy way and with drawings and
00:47:14 so it wasn't very difficult for me
00:47:24 what else is there
00:47:27 ellis beta d  ice get the one dollar course it
00:47:30 is impossible with a credit card
00:47:35 the one dollar course to lisbeth a tell me in
00:47:39 which country tell me in which country are you
00:47:42 trying it I think paypal
00:47:46 works a little differently in each country
00:47:50 when you go to turn off
00:47:53 look what  You have to see
00:48:00 once
00:48:02 this is the page to
00:48:06 check out or to pay with paypal
00:48:10 and then here it tells you paypal then
00:48:14 it asks you for a username and password
00:48:19 but down
00:48:21 below there is a link that says
00:48:24 pay 50 or pay with  card or something like that
00:48:29 you can click on this link and
00:48:32 pay for the one dollar course
00:48:37 try this I don't know if you've
00:48:39 tried the enrolled tell me if you've
00:48:42 tried this link and if you still
00:48:46 can't you can't pay I'll try to see
00:48:49 see how to fix it
00:48:55 bryant says yes I think it has value in
00:49:00 the dl levels no they are not
00:49:03 dl levels they are cfr levels of the
00:49:08 european reference framework I
00:49:11 don't think it's called ce
00:49:13 efe er I think
00:49:17 they are a1 a2 b1 b2
00:49:25 115 2 no
00:49:29 the levels  let's see they are not based on the
00:49:34 grammar method really if you read it
00:49:36 if you read what is in each level they never
00:49:39 say anything about grammar so
00:49:43 I think it is not a problem
00:49:49 what happens is that when you learn with
00:49:54 input when you learn  naturally
00:49:58 you
00:49:59 when what you understand is listening and
00:50:02 what you speak are not at the same level
00:50:05 so if you speak when you speak when to
00:50:10 listen let's say listen to these this is going
00:50:13 to be an ear let's see if it comes out
00:50:16 I don't have another red I'm running out of
00:50:18 red  red didn't suit me red
00:50:21 well I'm going to do it in black in lilac
00:50:24 then I'll do it in lilac in morality when
00:50:28 listening
00:50:31 listening you can understand listening to something
00:50:35 at a dice level you can talk maybe at
00:50:38 level one or less
00:50:42 and when you understand at level b1 you can
00:50:45 talk at level  So in this sense it
00:50:50 's a bit different, not if you
00:50:52 learn naturally
00:50:56 I think there's something better than this which
00:51:01 is number of words number of words
00:51:04 not number of words you would know
00:51:08 tr  to adduce but the number of words that
00:51:11 you have really acquired that when
00:51:13 you hear them you
00:51:14 already know what it means I think
00:51:17 that the number of words is something that
00:51:21 could be used more and that it is more useful
00:51:24 than many people think than many
00:51:26 people believe  it can also be
00:51:29 measured it is easy to measure if the person is
00:51:33 honest if the person tells you what
00:51:35 words he understands if not it is a bit more
00:51:38 difficult but well it is not very
00:51:41 difficult either what happens is that it is not easy to
00:51:43 do exams in a school  an
00:51:47 exam in with name number of
00:51:49 known words is it's a bit difficult
00:51:55 bar questions about hostel not about
00:51:59 crosstalk
00:52:01 let's see let's go in order luciana
00:52:03 questions about writing when you look
00:52:05 when you watch the videos luciana I
00:52:08 recommend not writing do not write do not
00:52:11 write anything when you see  the videos, if not
00:52:14 just watch the videos and if it is
00:52:22 very difficult if you find it difficult to understand then
00:52:25 watch easier videos watch a lower level
00:52:30 happy accidents says you are going to do more
00:52:32 interviews co  n other youtubers happy
00:52:35 accidents tell me tell me which youtubers
00:52:37 you want to see and I can try to do more
00:52:40 interviews right

00:52:44 that are recorded and I have no plans
00:52:46 in the future to
00:52:49 record another
00:52:51 but it would be like that I would
00:52:54 like to do it
00:52:56 I already asked Juan Juan about Spanish
00:53:00 with Juan and he said no then well
00:53:05 I can try it again I can
00:53:07 ask Juan again to see if he has changed
00:53:10 his plan if his plans have changed maybe
00:53:13 now he says yes but
00:53:18 but hey  We'll see,
00:53:21 Jana, ask Pablo, what's your
00:53:24 normal speaking speed? Are you speaking at
00:53:27 50% speed, maybe 50%? Look,
00:53:34 I'm going to talk to you from now on at
00:53:36 normal speed,
00:53:40 a little bit, I'm going to try a little bit,
00:53:42 well, look, I speak like that at normal speed  This is the
00:53:44 speed with which I would talk with my
00:53:45 friends with my family and such aviacsa
00:53:49 I'm going to try that I'm going to send more
00:53:51 messages to more youtubers to see if they
00:53:53 want to do collaborations or not and
00:53:54 we'll see we'll see v  er if there is someone who
00:53:56 also wants how I find
00:54:00 crosstalk partners any way
00:54:02 you can meet people I have tried
00:54:05 using apps like pro the car -that or tandem
00:54:09 and it is knowing how to explain it you have to
00:54:11 explain to people what you expect of
00:54:13 them and what  understand well people
00:54:15 don't know crosstalk and don't know the
00:54:17 method and you have to explain how how to
00:54:19 do it it's okay for
00:54:23 those who don't anymore I'm not going to
00:54:25 speak a little slower and explain
00:54:28 more clearly okay that was an
00:54:30 example of normal speed with  the
00:54:34 one i would speak
00:54:37 luca luca i sent him a message a long
00:54:40 time ago and he didn't reply he didn't reply

00:56:06 the news from madrid good
00:56:09 from spain but I have a problem
00:56:12 problems with other accents in spain'
00:56:15 what is and what is the importance of
00:56:18 getting used to these accents I
00:56:21 don't understand very well the question can be
00:56:24 understood in two ways is it important or
00:56:27 not to get used to those accents a  Those
00:56:30 accents are not very important, they are used
00:56:34 less, it depends more on whether you are going to live in
00:56:37 that place, well, it is okay
00:56:41 to get used to it. If what you are
00:56:43 asking is that it is important,
00:56:46 what do I have to do to get to bed?  umbrame to
00:56:49 those accents listening is listening a lot
00:56:53 is getting used to listening to
00:56:55 Spanish

00:57:33 that's my horse as a gift I give you my
00:57:41 horse Most of the intermediate material seems

00:57:45 bored ones Thank you, you're welcome
00:57:48 but ask  what do I do with my free time
00:57:53 what do I do with my free time learn
00:57:55 languages ​​continue with Thai with him
00:57:59 with Chinese
00:58:04 what do I do with my free time basically
00:58:07 this with my wife
00:58:08 we ​​go on the weekend during the weekend
00:58:11 to see I have an end from here
00:58:14 where  there is the end of understanding
00:58:17 the end of we are going to visit things
00:58:21 we are going to places
00:58:24 apart from that
00:58:26 I don't know I read yes I keep reading books
00:58:29 I have the  kindle and i'm reading i'm
00:58:32 reading in japanese actually yes i'm
00:58:35 still learning a little japanese
00:58:36 because i keep reading in japanese
00:58:44 and lan focus hello good alan focus i
00:58:49 know poli because he's a friend of mine but it's hard to
00:58:53 do a collaboration with land focus
00:58:56 because his videos  As the name indicates, they
00:59:00 are very focused, they are not very specific topics,
00:59:03 he has never collaborated with
00:59:07 other people,
00:59:09 he has never made videos in other
00:59:11 languages, I am not going to make a video
00:59:14 in English either, because the channel is about
00:59:17 speaking Spanish, so there is not
00:59:20 much overlap  Dreaming Spanish with
00:59:23 line focus to be able to collaborate. It's a
00:59:26 bit difficult
00:59:31 to see which exam I'm Cuban for and when
00:59:35 I listen to Spanish, I also find
00:59:36 some words strange, otherwise I don't
00:59:40 think we understand each other enough. We
00:59:43 also understand Cuban people, they
00:59:45 say things well.  Like bus but well
00:59:49 in the Canary Islands they also say woof woof
00:59:52 so they are just some words not
00:59:55 specific words
01:00:00 but it says that your videos f  My favorites are
01:00:03 the ones on how to learn languages. If I have
01:00:06 to do more, I'll make more videos
01:00:09 on how to learn languages. It's been a long,
01:00:12 long time since I made a video
01:00:17 about athletic.
01:00:33 you understand and today we are talking about the
01:00:38 new year not from 2020 to 2000 2021 but
01:00:44 today now is a bit like questions
01:00:48 questions and answers no
01:00:52 and well we've been for an hour
01:00:55 we've been for an hour so well it's going to
01:00:59 end in a little while
01:01:02 but hey we can finish
01:01:05 asking some questions
01:01:11 and that's what my interview with no hay
01:01:14 two says so I spoke with no hay two
01:01:17 they told me that in the future they
01:01:20 want to collaborate again to record a
01:01:23 video together again it may be that
01:01:26 we will go back to
01:01:29 a  record it
01:01:31 thank you thank you all for your
01:01:35 recommendations for other channels
01:01:40 to collaborate

01:01:46 here explain to me what has happened  Ces here you teach
01:01:49 Spanish also
01:01:53 because because you know dreaming Spanish we
01:01:56 explain why
01:02:04 we swear no yes in Spain we use a
01:02:06 lot of swear words I think that
01:02:09 in general in Spain we speak with a lot of
01:02:11 swear words we say
01:02:15 words that sound like they sound bad no
01:02:18 yes I think we are a  a little more
01:02:21 informal when it comes to talking
01:02:25 that's how we are good
01:02:28 well I think we can end here I wish you a
01:02:33 very happy 2021

00:00:05 here at Dreaming Spanish we have never
00:00:10 cooked food and today we are going to
00:00:14 cook a Spanish dish, a delicious dish,
00:00:19 we are going to cook croquettes
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:29 Hello, well, yes, we are going to cook and I don't
00:00:36 know if you know if you know  the
00:00:39 croquettes but they are very tasty and today
00:00:43 we are going to make croquettes to see how they
00:00:47 will be tasty or not
00:00:51 bad we will see but to make
00:00:55 croquettes
00:00:55 we are going to use chicken we are going to make
00:00:59 chicken croquettes the croquettes can
00:01:03 be chicken but they can also be
00:01:07 ham or fish or mushrooms of many
00:01:12 things but these are going to be chicken and
00:01:15 we have here chicken breast we have
00:01:18 chicken breast ok we are also going to
00:01:23 use flour the flour is used to make
00:01:27 bread not to make bread we have flour
00:01:31 we have bread  grated the breadcrumbs it is
00:01:35 bread that they have grated it they have made it
00:01:38 small we do not have we have here breadcrumbs
00:01:43 we are also going to use butter
00:01:47 here butter butter salt
00:01:52 oil
00:01:54 we have  milk cow's milk whole
00:01:58 milk normal cow's milk
00:02:01 we have a new one
00:02:04 an onion a small onion and water
00:02:07 but the water is not for cooking the water
00:02:11 is for drinking I
00:02:14 very well so for cooking
00:02:18 we are going to use this this is a casserole it
00:02:23 is a casserole like  You see, it's a little
00:02:26 thick, it's thick, a frying pan would be
00:02:32 finer, the frying pans are finer and
00:02:35 a pot is deeper, deeper,
00:02:38 well, it's more or less a casserole, but it's
00:02:41 a slightly strange casserole, a little
00:02:44 different because it's electric, it connects
00:02:48 to  electricity to the current
00:02:51 in Spain' normally we do not use this
00:02:55 type of casserole but here
00:02:58 I only have this in my house I do
00:03:02 not have a kitchen I do not have a kitchen to cook
00:03:05 I have to use this so well I am going to
00:03:08 use this
00:03:10 and first we are going to cook the  chicken
00:03:14 the chicken to cook the chicken
00:03:17 and we put a little oil in the
00:03:21 casserole
00:03:22 we put a little a little bit of oil if
00:03:26 you have olive oil better this
00:03:30 is soybean oil not if you have olive better
00:03:36 a little  a little bit of oil is not much
00:03:40 worth
00:03:42 and then we cook the chicken wash
00:03:46 our hands don't don't don't cook with dirty hands
00:03:50 you don't have to wash them then
00:03:54 chicken the breast no the chicken breast
00:04:00 I'm going to cook it here I'm going to make just
00:04:04 one breast I don't need a lot  meat
00:04:07 the chicken we don't need much we are going to
00:04:12 cut it very small and we
00:04:14 don't need a lot so okay
00:04:19 we are going to cook the chicken
00:04:22 while the chicken is being cooked
00:04:24 I am going to prepare
00:04:29 I am going to prepare the onion the onion
00:04:33 first we peel the onion I have to
00:04:37 peel the  onion
00:04:43 is fine and this knife is not the best for
00:04:48 cutting onions it is not ideal but well
00:04:53 I only have this knife
00:04:58 so we
00:05:00 start here
00:05:04 and cut like this
00:05:12 then we cut like this
00:05:21 and finally we cut like this
00:05:31 okay well if we cut the onion
00:05:34 we cut it very fine very fine and  now
00:05:38 this half the other half
00:05:44 and the same thing
00:05:48 very good the onion is done
00:05:53 okay
00:05:55 the chicken is done it's already cooked and now
00:06:01 we are going to cook the onion let's see I put
00:06:04 the  onion here first
00:06:07 I put the chicken the chicken I put it here
00:06:12 here on the wood this is wood it's not
00:06:15 wood it's not made of wood
00:06:17 but it's wood to cut things I
00:06:20 'm going to wash the pot
00:06:26 so to cook the onion
00:06:29 we also suggest oil  better with
00:06:33 olive oil we put oil we put
00:06:38 well yes it is quite a lot of oil
00:06:43 and we add the onion then we cook
00:06:47 the onion until the onion
00:06:51 changes color and becomes transparent
00:06:56 it becomes transparent or if you like
00:06:59 it to turn golden it turns
00:07:01 yellow  golden brown and while the onion is cooking
00:07:07 we are going to cut the chicken
00:07:11 we also have to cut the chicken thin very thin it
00:07:15 is hot
00:07:18 hot from the chicken okay that's it we are not going
00:07:21 to use all the chicken because we are not going to
00:07:25 make many croquettes but you
00:07:28 can use everything everything  the chicken is
00:07:33 worth the onion well it's getting
00:07:37 a little longer we have to wait wait
00:07:41 a little and the chicken the chicken I'm going to
00:07:45 unhook it I'm going to rip it off a little
00:07:49 okay the onion is fine it's quite
00:07:54 good I'm going to put it here
00:08:01 okay the chicken we can put it here with
00:08:05 the onion
00:08:07 we can put it here okay I'm going to scrub
00:08:11 the casserole and now I'll come okay okay the
00:08:14 following is the dough the dough of the
00:08:18 croquettes the  dough we have to make the
00:08:22 dough to be able to make the croquettes the
00:08:25 croquettes shape them shape it's
00:08:28 not a ball it's the shape of a croquette
00:08:32 shape of a croquette
00:08:34 and the dough is similar to
00:08:38 béchamel sauce and is made with butter
00:08:42 and flour and  with flour then
00:08:48 we start putting butter a piece
00:08:52 like this more or less of butter
00:08:55 and you if you use all the
00:08:59 chicken breast if you use all the chicken
00:09:02 you can put more butter put
00:09:07 double double the butter put
00:09:09 well like this more or less not having I teach you
00:09:14 Look, look at how big it is,
00:09:17 you can put twice as much and have
00:09:20 more croquettes. Okay, so
00:09:24 we make the butter
00:09:28 and with the butter we are going to cook the
00:09:32 h  flour the flour we are not going to put flour
00:09:38 we put a little flour we mix we
00:09:40 mix well ok good we can put
00:09:44 a little more a little more flour
00:09:51 ok it remains so it remains like a
00:09:56 dough
00:09:58 like a dough that is not very very hard
00:10:00 and that it is not left  the liquid is okay and
00:10:04 we cook what we sign here and
00:10:07 we cook like this for a few minutes and then
00:10:11 we add milk we have to add
00:10:15 milk we have to add milk little by
00:10:18 little very little by little
00:10:35 we mix we mix well the fire went down a little
00:10:38 the fire the fire  that it is not very
00:10:41 very strong ok here we also put salt
00:10:46 salt we have to put it here
00:10:52 we mix well
00:10:55 and we also put the onion and the chicken
00:10:58 very well
00:11:01 and this is the dough for the croquettes
00:11:05 we are going to shape this dough and cook the
00:11:08 croquettes then the dough
00:11:12 we have to wait we have to wait
00:11:14 for it to cool down to get colder
00:11:17 because now it is hot it is very
00:11:20 hot
00:11:22 in the meantime we are going to prepare
00:11:26 breadcrumbs
00:11:29 we have the breadcrumbs
00:11:32 we are preparing flour ta  Also more flour is
00:11:36 worth flour and egg We break the egg
00:11:45 and beat the egg We beat
00:11:54 the egg too and we can also add a
00:11:57 little salt
00:12:02 to the egg and we beat it until all the eggs are the same
00:12:04 color and have one color only
00:12:08 works because the croquettes
00:12:13 We are going to fry the croquettes to fry them we have
00:12:17 to coat them we have to put them in
00:12:19 batter and the batter will be first
00:12:23 flour
00:12:26 then
00:12:28 later
00:12:33 and then breadcrumbs
00:12:36 will be dough flour egg breadcrumbs and
00:12:40 croquettes and the croquettes we will put them
00:12:43 we will put them here and now we wait
00:12:47 we wait a bit for the dough to cool down
00:12:50 ok
00:12:52 the dough has been in the
00:12:56 fridge for 20 minutes in the fridge and it's
00:12:59 good it's a little hot but no no
00:13:03 it doesn't burn no no and now
00:13:07 with the dough we're going to shape it into a
00:13:10 croquette
00:13:12 with a little  better flour with a
00:13:15 little flour
00:13:22 and make the croquettes
00:13:25 and in flour
00:13:27 to the egg flour egg and breadcrumbs
00:13:32 in the egg we give the breadcrumbs a turn
00:13:39 and here the same first flour
00:13:44 I will  We add the flour that has a lot of
00:13:46 flour then egg
00:13:49 and then
00:13:51 breadcrumbs
00:13:53 and if we have a croquette
00:13:59 here we have another
00:14:01 2
00:14:03 3 croquettes we do the same the same
00:14:08 for all the dough
00:14:11 ok this croquette looks like a panda bear it
00:14:14 is a bit big but well
00:14:18 it breaks very  Well, we already have all the
00:14:22 croquettes, we have got 13 13 croquettes,
00:14:26 if you want more, you can use more, more
00:14:30 chicken, more butter, more flour,
00:14:34 and you will need two eggs, a new
00:14:38 one has been good for me, but if you want more
00:14:40 croquettes, then two eggs is better,
00:14:44 then the last one.  The next step is to fry the
00:14:49 croquettes
00:14:50 we are going to use oil but to fry it
00:14:55 is best not to use olive oil
00:14:59 olive oil is not very good for
00:15:01 frying it is
00:15:03 better to use another type of oil and here
00:15:08 we do have to put a lot of oil
00:15:14 okay
00:15:15 okay let's start frying  the croquettes
00:15:27 that are golden golden in
00:15:30 color like this a little brown
00:15:34 even with a good color very good color very good
00:15:37 very good

00:00:10 virtual reality and we are going to continue with
00:00:14 the scary game
00:00:17 there is a problem one thing that I had
00:00:21 not realized I did not know and that is that in this
00:00:26 game every time you play the map the
00:00:31 area the  labyrinth is different so
00:00:35 now it is I have tried playing again
00:00:38 and it is different than the other time
00:00:42 and the other time when I stop playing
00:00:47 in the middle of a zone in the middle of one of
00:00:51 the zones and it has not been saved it is not
00:00:54 saved  game so I'm going to redo
00:00:58 that zone I'm going to redo that
00:01:01 entire zone so that the game is saved
00:01:05 and next time we can continue from the
00:01:10 same place okay then come and see
00:01:16 okay as you can see this is different it's very
00:01:19 different than the last time
00:01:22 we had  leaky gold and parchment they
00:01:28 don't tell me anything useful it's never useful at all
00:01:31 this the parchments more oil good

00:02:06 get tired maybe by the time

00:02:32 open just in case I learned last time that it
00:02:35 is good to close the doors behind you and of
00:02:40 course it is also good if they are already
00:02:42 open so you don't have to open them
00:02:45 when you  chase a monster when
00:02:47 you think you're going to die
00:02:50 and a lot of noise today with a lot of noise of course
00:02:54 uh here it will be there was something you saw
00:02:58 something I saw something there to be with the
00:03:02 lady yet because now I'm

309,"00:00:00 today I am going to explain how long it
00:00:04 takes how long it takes to go from
00:00:09 zero to zero to being able to speak Spanish
00:00:16 to being able to speak Spanish fluently like
00:00:21 me
00:00:25 [Music]
00:00:28 hello yes well look this is you this or
00:00:34 this is you ok
00:00:37 and today for  this we are going to assume that you
00:00:43 know how to speak English that you already speak English
00:00:48 because it is a little different it is a little
00:00:52 different depending on what language
00:00:56 you know no if you speak English if you already know
00:01:01 how to speak English how long does it take
00:01:04 to be able to speak Spanish no well look
00:01:08 starting from scratch
00:01:12 the first the first step
00:01:15 well there is some step some step in
00:01:17 between but the first
00:01:20 important step is at 150 hours with 150
00:01:27 hours listening to Spanish listening and
00:01:31 understanding Spanish you can understand
00:01:35 a person speaking to a person to a
00:01:39 person a person like me a person
00:01:42 a  teacher a teacher speaking spanish
00:01:46 very easy speaking spanish for you for
00:01:51 a person who is studying who is
00:01:54 learning the next step
00:01:58 is at 300 hours with  300 hours you can
00:02:04 understand a person a normal person
00:02:09 a person who is not a
00:02:12 Spanish teacher but a patient
00:02:16 person a nice person a person who when
00:02:20 you don't understand you don't understand something because he
00:02:24 is patient he says it he says it
00:02:27 differently he says it more  easy the
00:02:31 next one the next step is more or
00:02:35 less at 700 hours at 700 hours
00:02:40 can you understand a person
00:02:44 a person speaking Spanish
00:02:46 normally speaking fast and speaking
00:02:51 normally normally they don't have to be
00:02:54 patient they don't have to say it in a
00:02:57 different way  in an easier way you
00:03:00 start to understand Spanish more difficult
00:03:04 and at 700 hours you can speak you can
00:03:08 speak a lot but there are still many
00:03:12 words you don't know
00:03:16 the next step at 1000 hours all
00:03:20 this is more or less
00:03:23 different people different people
00:03:26 learn also at a pace  at a
00:03:28 different speed but at 1000
00:03:31 hours you
00:03:34 can also speak Spanish speak Spanish
00:03:39 comfortably easily without problems
00:03:43 without missing without missing
00:03:46 important words you can understand tv
00:03:51 understand tv shows
00:03:54 understand movies also not understand
00:03:58 movies understand tv and
00:04:01 movies mostly easy
00:04:04 movies not movies very very difficult but
00:04:08 easy movies most
00:04:10 tv you will understand  Well, and the
00:04:14 next step is more like
00:04:17 1,500,500 hours 1,500
00:04:22 hours of listening to Spanish, of speaking, of
00:04:27 using Spanish
00:04:29 , you will be at the next level,
00:04:33 you will be able to speak, speak without getting tired, without getting
00:04:37 tired, we will not get tired, you will be able to read,
00:04:41 read books, read difficult books and
00:04:45 you will be able to understand.  any movie
00:04:48 understand any
00:04:50 television program you can do the same the
00:04:54 same as me not maybe not exactly the
00:04:58 same but in practice the things you
00:05:03 can do if you go to spain if you go to
00:05:06 mexico will be the same as me so
00:05:10 why because i said what
00:05:15 i said  assuming that you know English
00:05:18 by  If you don't know English, you don't
00:05:22 know another European language, another European language
00:05:27 will be more and more
00:05:32 difficult and
00:05:35 you have to multiply these hours,
00:05:39 multiply by 1.5, no, then they will be
00:05:44 225
00:05:51 450,000
00:05:53 thousand 51 thousand 500 2  1,250
00:06:00 but if you already know how to speak
00:06:03 French or Italian or Portuguese then it
00:06:08 will be very easy for you and you can divide the hours
00:06:13 by two if then it will be much
00:06:17 easier it will be 75 150 450 not 500
00:06:27 and 750 it will be much easier so if
00:06:33 you want to know more you have  look at
00:06:36 our language learning map map
00:06:40 and on the map you will see that these
00:06:43 levels these levels correspond to
00:06:47 level 7 not to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3
00:06:54 well you will see that here more or
00:06:57 less here is 2 and then level  1
00:07:01 and if you look at the poster the map you will know
00:07:06 what you have to do at each step to go
00:07:09 to the next step to advance to the
00:07:12 next step all you have
00:07:16 to do is go down to the description
00:07:19 there is a link a link to sign up for
00:07:23 the mailing list the

00:00:03 understand it catalan
00:00:05 you know that there are people in spain and
00:00:09 catalonia who hate sushi today i am going to
00:00:16 explain the problems between catalonia and
00:00:21 the rest of spain
00:00:25 catalonia now there are people
00:00:29 people
00:00:32 who say i am not spanish i  I'm not
00:00:38 from Spain yes yes
00:00:42 why why did this happen a long time ago
00:00:46 spain there were three kingdoms there was the kingdom
00:00:53 the kingdom
00:00:55 of aragon the kingdom of portugal
00:01:00 portugal
00:01:03 and the kingdom of castilla castilla and
00:01:09 three different languages ​​were spoken
00:01:12 here catalan here castilian or spanish
00:01:16 is what  same and Portuguese here then
00:01:22 there was a war a war
00:01:25 between aragon and castile and they got together they got
00:01:33 together
00:01:34 but still now catalonia
00:01:39 valencia and the balearic islands
00:01:43 catalan is not spanish but
00:01:47 catalan for example in catalonia
00:01:52 more or less 50 percent of the
00:01:57 houses speak  catalan
00:02:01 catalan and 50 percent of the houses
00:02:07 speak spanish
00:02:15 so
00:02:17 and in catalonia it is normal for there to be one
00:02:21 person
00:02:23 one person speaking catalan and one
00:02:27 person
00:02:29 speaking c  spanish and having a
00:02:33 conversation catalan spanish catalan
00:02:36 spanish catalan calm normal conversation
00:02:40 yes yes and they speak two
00:02:43 different languages ​​but they understand each other in catalonia
00:02:48 all the schools the schools are in
00:02:54 catalan
00:02:56 the study classes the books
00:03:00 are in catalan everyone after
00:03:03 school
00:03:05 in the  universities there are professors
00:03:12 andstudents
00:03:14 there are students and professors professors there are
00:03:18 professors who speak Catalan and
00:03:21 there are also professors who speak
00:03:24 Spanish at the university that is why
00:03:32 foreign students from France sometimes come from many places students come from many places
00:03:37 and they hear Catalan they do
00:03:44 not understand it no  they understand it and they complain
00:03:47 because catalan catalan no no i don't
00:03:51 understand it catalan the teacher has to
00:03:54 speak spanish man yes it is a
00:03:58 problem
00:04:00 when i was little i had friends
00:04:04 friends who were independentistas
00:04:08 independentistas means they
00:04:11 thought catalonia has to be
00:04:17 separated another country no  It's Spain, it's not
00:04:20 Spain, they  They wanted they wanted
00:04:23 Catalonia to be another country and there are also
00:04:27 people there are people who think that Catalonia,
00:04:31 Valencia and the Balearic Islands
00:04:36 should all be a separate country
00:04:39 separated from Spain when I was little
00:04:43 there were not many people there were not
00:04:48 many who thought of separating from Spain
00:04:52 but now there are  a lot of people a lot of people
00:04:57 in catalonia who don't don't like they
00:05:03 don't like the government
00:05:07 the government in madrid
00:05:11 don't don't like
00:05:15 it that's why now more and more
00:05:20 people
00:05:22 want to separate say catalonia is a
00:05:27 separate country from spain many people do
00:05:32 n't don't  gusta rajoy rajoy is this gentleman
00:05:36 look this gentleman is he is the president
00:05:41 of spain the president is the gentleman
00:05:48 ma'am but in spain we have never had a
00:05:52 female president
00:05:55 now it is the gentleman
00:05:58 that everyone is under him he is the
00:06:03 gentleman with the most power in the country
00:06:08 and a lot  People in Catalonia don't like it,
00:06:12 Rajoy doesn't like it and now there are people who
00:06:17 say let's vote vote no a vote
00:06:23 with papers
00:06:28 yes
00:06:29 on papers

00:07:10 what do you think of all this in your country is
00:07:13 there a problem there is  people who are
00:07:18 thinking of separating and making a
00:07:20 separate country or I don't think I think that in

00:00:08 [Music]
00:00:11 hello
00:00:13 this video is going to be a little different
00:00:19 a little different because normally in
00:00:25 one day for example Wednesday not in one
00:00:32 day I record recorded several videos I record
00:00:37 I don't know 1 2
00:00:40 3 maybe I don't know 88 videos yes
00:00:46 but not today today I am only going to record
00:00:52 a video yes
00:00:56 because yesterday
00:00:59 yesterday yesterday not yesterday I went to the
00:01:05 market and we bought vegetables we bought
00:01:11 vegetables yes a lot of vegetables so
00:01:15 today I am going to talk about vegetables I am going to show you
00:01:19 all the vegetables
00:01:24 What we buy in the market and if you don't
00:01:30 know I live in Thailand I live in
00:01:34 Bangkok so I went to the market here in
00:01:39 Bangkok and I'm going to show you how
00:01:43 the vegetables from Spain and
00:01:48 Thailand are different
00:01:53 and the first thing is this what is this  This is
00:01:59 good I'm not very sure I think it's
00:02:03 chives chives yes and I say I
00:02:07 'm not very sure because firstly in
00:02:11 Spain chives are not very common chives are
00:02:15 not used much
00:02:18 and secondly it's good that in Spain it's
00:02:22 normally different  e is I don't know more
00:02:26 green maybe it doesn't have this part so
00:02:29 white so big it's like an onion it's not
00:02:34 similar to onions but in
00:02:37 Spain we eat a lot of onions onions
00:02:40 like this not round onions
00:02:43 but chives we don't usually eat
00:02:47 chives it's not very normal so I
00:02:50 wanted you  show how they are
00:02:53 here in thailand they have different
00:02:57 types various types of chives the same
00:03:00 as in japan in japan they also eat a
00:03:04 lot they eat a lot of chives and there are
00:03:08 different types also no so
00:03:11 this is something that is good in spain
00:03:14 normally we do not eat sometimes if it is
00:03:18 found  in the supermarket but there is
00:03:20 very little very little amount in the supermarket
00:03:25 there is very little and many people don't usually do
00:03:29 n't know it no and they don't usually cook they don't usually
00:03:33 cook with chives
00:03:36 what else
00:03:38 this is very different very different than
00:03:41 in spain let's
00:03:44 see you know you know that  is this
00:03:49 these are aubergines yes they are aubergines
00:03:53 very small very very small in spain
00:03:57 the aubergines are like this they are not good they are
00:04:03 like this they
00:04:05 are like this they are
00:04:08 cabbage colored  or / black maybe between black and
00:04:12 purple but dark, very dark, it's not
00:04:16 purple or lilac like that so so light
00:04:22 here in Thailand they have these and
00:04:27 they also have you a little
00:04:30 bigger than they are I don't know like that more or less in
00:04:35 size let's see  so
00:04:38 they are green and white so
00:04:45 they are sometimes cooked they are cooked they are
00:04:49 eaten in the green curry the green curry
00:04:53 is very good but they are also eaten
00:04:57 raw they are eaten like this so yes
00:05:04 so raw without cooking they
00:05:10 taste a very strong flavor  very intense
00:05:15 I don't like them no no
00:05:17 I don't like them I don't like them raw I
00:05:21 don't like them uncooked I like them
00:05:26 yes I like them when they are cooked the
00:05:31 white and green ones are cooked you are not
00:05:35 you are not I have not seen them cooked the
00:05:39 people here in Thailand  They eat them like this
00:05:44 they eat them raw but I don't
00:05:47 like them very much this is a piece of
00:05:51 pumpkin it's a quarter not
00:05:56 a quarter of a pumpkin and this pumpkin
00:06:01 is also different it
00:06:04 's a little different it's green on the outside it's green on the outside
00:06:08 p  or inside
00:06:13 yes it is orange it is orange the same as
00:06:18 in europe the same as in the usa I don't know
00:06:23 the shape the shape it has is similar
00:06:27 to the pumpkins I don't know about the US the
00:06:32 Halloween pumpkins no
00:06:35 but it is different it is different from the
00:06:38 pumpkin in Spain the  pumpkins in
00:06:41 spain are shaped a bit like
00:06:46 this not if this is a pumpkin the
00:06:50 most normal pumpkins you see in the
00:06:53 supermarket in spain are shaped like this
00:06:56 a bit like a pear like a
00:07:00 pear but in truth they are bigger
00:07:03 bigger than the  pears this pumpkin is
00:07:08 more similar to pumpkins from japan not
00:07:13 to the pumpkins that are eaten in japan
00:07:18 japan it
00:07:21 is very very good it is very good it is
00:07:25 very tasty the pumpkins the pumpkins in
00:07:30 spain are rough like
00:07:35 rough that's why we make cream we make
00:07:40 a cream  and such but no we don't
00:07:42 eat it like this we don't eat it it hasn't been
00:07:49 cooked whole piece by piece
00:07:52 no we don't eat it but it is a yes it
00:07:56 can be eaten on a barbecue or
00:08:00 boiled in a pot
00:08:05 in a  Boiled pot blub blub blub with
00:08:08 water and this one is very good
00:08:13 pumpkin what more
00:08:16 beans green beans these beans
00:08:20 are also very different from the ones in
00:08:24 Spain
00:08:26 I'm going to get one I'm going to get one a bean
00:08:30 so why
00:08:35 because
00:08:38 these beans are different they don't need to be cooked if
00:08:43 they can be eaten like this they can be eaten raw
00:08:50 and they are good they are good raw
00:08:55 the ones from Spain not the ones from Spain you have to
00:08:59 cook them you have to boil them for example
00:09:02 yes we have beans we have beans the
00:09:06 same as these round not round
00:09:11 normally a little finer a little
00:09:14 more  thin and we have flat beans that are
00:09:18 flatter not the flat ones the flat ones are
00:09:25 more normal more people like the
00:09:28 flat ones but hey we also eat the round ones too
00:09:32 but you always
00:09:36 have to boil them you have to cook them
00:09:39 yes but you are here in Thailand
00:09:44 many times  they are eaten raw they are eaten
00:09:48 without cooking without having to cook them and they
00:09:52 are good
00:09:55 so what do we have here these are
00:09:59 asparagus and these are the same
00:10:05 they are the same or good or similar to the ones in
00:10:10 Spain yes why because I brought
00:10:14 asparagus well I like them I
00:10:19 like asparagus that's why in the
00:10:22 market we buy asparagus
00:10:26 but I was also surprised I was
00:10:30 surprised to see that there are asparagus
00:10:33 they do sell  Asparagus here in Asia I
00:10:37 don't know I don't know if it's very normal if a lot of
00:10:41 people eat asparagus
00:10:43 I haven't seen many dishes a lot of
00:10:47 Asian cuisine that has asparagus that's why I was
00:10:52 surprised and well I like
00:10:54 asparagus and I bought it
00:10:57 yes there is a vegetable that never here
00:11:01 I see I never see it that my wife, for
00:11:05 example, had never eaten it here in
00:11:09 Thailand, what are the artichokes? The
00:11:13 artichokes here are very rare, I
00:11:18 have never seen them like this, fresh and frozen.
00:11:27 in
00:11:32 thailand
00:11:34 well here I have a bag a bag with
00:11:38 two things and the two are also quite
00:11:43 different from those in Spain no
00:11:47 what is this these are cucumbers
00:11:51 there are many there are not here there are
00:11:55 longer and shorter ones these cucumbers are
00:12:00 very small very very small yes in
00:12:03 spain
00:12:07 in spain a cucumber would be like this
00:12:11 more or less like this it would be
00:12:16 green dark green not light green
00:12:20 not like this white like this  no it wouldn't be
00:12:26 darker longer and thicker
00:12:29 also thicker it's not so so thin
00:12:33 [Music]
00:12:35 but it's so good I like I
00:12:39 like the cucumbers here and we
00:12:43 also have carrots
00:12:47 these carrots are also are
00:12:50 different
00:12:52 these carrots are are  big are very
00:12:56 big
00:12:58 the cucumbers are small and the
00:13:02 carrots are big the carrots in
00:13:06 spain well sometimes they are that long
00:13:11 yes sometimes there are shorter ones and there
00:13:15 are also longer ones in spain but in spain
00:13:19 they are never that thick they are not that thick
00:13:24 no  They're not like that, yes, that's normal, but they're
00:13:30 so thick, not
00:13:33 me. The first time I saw carrots like this,
00:13:37 so thick, so fat, it was in Japan,
00:13:41 and these are more or less like
00:13:46 Japanese carrots, so  well
00:13:50 when i saw them here in thailand no i was not
00:13:55 surprised but the first time i
00:13:59 saw them in japan yes yes i was surprised
00:14:04 because oysters how fat the carrots
00:14:09 and finally something very common very normal
00:14:13 here in thailand which are hot chili
00:14:17 peppers not this  no these are leaves but
00:14:21 well these are hot peppers they are
00:14:23 small peppers very small in
00:14:26 thailand there are small ones there are big ones there are
00:14:30 red in color green in color they
00:14:34 eat a lot of peppers a lot of chili
00:14:38 peppers hot chili peppers no the food in
00:14:41 thailand is very
00:14:43 very spicy
00:14:45 and this is something that in  the market in
00:14:49 spain and in the supermarket is not very
00:14:53 common normally it is difficult to
00:14:58 find
00:14:59 yes and well yes that's it this is the
00:15:04 latest here
00:15:07 in thailand they also have many
00:15:09 vegetables
00:15:12 other other vegetables that are good they are
00:15:16 like spain they are more or less like spain
00:15:19 So I have not brought these to show you,
00:15:23 but yes, there are that are
00:15:26 like in Spain, but also
00:15:30 there that in Spain they do not exist
00:15:34 like this.  or no I don't know what it's called in
00:15:38 Spanish but there are several types and there are
00:15:41 leaves especially many many leaves
00:15:45 many leaves
00:15:48 many leaves of different plants of
00:15:52 many different plants that
00:15:56 we don't eat in Spain
00:15:58 and well these are some of the
00:16:02 differences of the vegetables from the
00:16:07 vegetables from Spain and Thailand and
00:16:11 I hope you like it that

00:06:20 1 and it's over you can't throw
00:06:28 tomatoes anymore people throw a lot of tomatoes and it
00:06:32 can hit you in the eye and hurt you so
00:06:35 you don't get hurt there are rules that you have
00:06:39 to follow  the first rule is
00:06:44 that you can't throw bottles
00:06:49 because
00:06:53 you can't throw stones you shouldn't because
00:06:57 you can't because if it hits you it
00:07:00 hurts tomatoes
00:07:02 yes but no bottles and stones
00:07:06 the second rule
00:07:10 is
00:07:11 that tomatoes have to be crushed  why
00:07:15 and you crush them and then you throw them away
00:07:17 the tomatoes are soft they are not hard
00:07:25 the third rule is to wear glasses
00:07:29 glasses are like that
00:07:37 you wear them to protect yourself protect
00:07:40 your eyes and so you don't  And tomatoes get in
00:07:44 the eye
00:07:46 later it is not a rule but it is better to
00:07:50 do
00:07:53 it clothes
00:07:56 and shoes end up full of tomato
00:07:59 tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato
00:08:02 then it is not worth washing them and the
00:08:07 clothes are thrown in the trash directly
00:08:10 there is no need to wash them
00:08:14 lately the  Tomatina is very famous
00:08:19 internationally, people come from Europe, from the
00:08:22 USA, from Japan, a lot of people also come,
00:08:25 the Japanese know about the Tomatina, I don't know
00:08:29 why, then years ago there were a
00:08:33 lot of people, it reached 40 45,000
00:08:40 people,
00:08:42 there were too many people, so Buñol
00:08:45 said no, not so many people put up a  limit to
00:08:50 22,000 people so now to go to
00:08:55 the tomatina to see it you have to pay
00:08:58 pay
00:09:00 I don't know I don't know how many euros and they give you a
00:09:05 ticket a ticket to the tomatina in Buñol
00:09:13 and you pay for the ticket then you can go

00:10:43 [Music
00:10:44 ] throughout the week
00:10:46 there are more or less a
00:10:52 million people
00:10:55 more or less a million a million
00:11:00 a million people who come to see
00:11:03 Sanfermines to run a lot of people I
00:11:07 think
00:11:11 in the world it
00:11:13 is the festival in Spain that most people
00:11:16 know,
00:11:20 people come from many countries from other
00:11:24 countries in Europe and other countries come to
00:11:28 run
00:11:30 the people who run wear clothes all
00:11:35 They still
00:11:36 wear a white shirt they
00:11:41 wear
00:11:45 white pants they wear
00:11:50 a
00:11:52 red sash and they wear a scarf around their
00:11:57 necks also red
00:12:04 I think I think that once in my life

00:12:12 anfermines and what do you think
00:12:18 goodbye

192,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about the five things
00:00:04 the five things that we like that we
00:00:10 like about Spanish girls, us
00:00:14 boys,
00:00:18 5 things to fall
00:00:22 in love with to make a Spanish boy fall in love
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:33 I am going to tell you the five things the five
00:00:38 things  But first, a warning is
00:00:43 that boys are not all the same, we
00:00:48 are not the same, and of course it is not the same
00:00:52 for everyone, but I think that many
00:00:57 boys in Spain like
00:01:01 these five things, and if not,
00:01:06 I do like them.  these five things are okay
00:01:10 then the first the first is that
00:01:15 we like a girl to be happy be
00:01:20 she laugh hahaha smile
00:01:24 she is not always sad
00:01:30 angry we like her to be happy
00:01:34 hahahaha that she likes to laugh laugh ha ha
00:01:38 ha ha ha ha ha ha when we say something
00:01:42 she ha ha  ha ha ha laugh yes yes yes
00:01:47 boys have egos we don't like it we
00:01:50 like others ha ha ha ha they laugh
00:01:54 when we say we say something yes
00:01:58 then the second thing the second
00:02:03 thing we like about girls is that  be a
00:02:07 good person that is a good person
00:02:10 means that if they see a person,
00:02:16 an older person is an older person
00:02:19 who helps them, for example, if they are
00:02:24 eating in a restaurant and
00:02:28 the waiter comes, the waiter comes,
00:02:31 if it is a girl who talks, who talks to her
00:02:35 The waiter is wrong, what are you doing? This
00:02:39 is wrong, or if he is a person who does not
00:02:45 speak well with the waiter or with the
00:02:48 children, with other people, it is something
00:02:51 that we do not like. We like that he
00:02:55 is a good person who is kind and
00:02:58 friendly
00:03:00 the third thing is that she is a
00:03:04 fun girl fun means that she
00:03:10 likes that she likes to go out of the house not at
00:03:15 home she likes to go out she likes to go dancing
00:03:20 on a trip
00:03:24 with a plane on a trip that she likes to do
00:03:28 things
00:03:29 that she is not there all day  at home boring
00:03:34 yes we like that girls who are not
00:03:40 boring who are funny even if they
00:03:46 are a little crazy yes I think that the
00:03:50 boys like us we liked them a lot if it
00:03:53 is fun if when you are with the
00:03:57 girl never  ca you never get bored
00:04:02 the fourth thing
00:04:05 the fourth thing
00:04:08 I think is very important
00:04:12 and that is that we like girls who
00:04:17 have personality girls
00:04:23 when they think of something they say it they don't
00:04:28 shut up
00:04:31 girls you can't tell them you see
00:04:35 there blind access to the dishes
00:04:39 she swept the dining room you clean no no no no
00:04:45 if it's a girl you go and tell her and she
00:04:49 does this and she goes and does it
00:04:53 and it's also very boring no I think
00:04:58 I don't like it I don't like I
00:05:03 don't like that one  girl does not have her
00:05:07 own personality her own way of
00:05:10 thinking her own ideas
00:05:15 [Music]
00:05:17 and the 5th
00:05:20 the fifth is something that is perhaps a
00:05:24 little different from other countries
00:05:29 in other countries in Europe in Asia
00:05:35 especially
00:05:37 and
00:05:39 that is that we like the  affectionate girls we
00:05:44 like a girl when the girl
00:05:47 likes to hug she likes to kiss
00:05:53 she likes to touch us yes I think that here in
00:05:58 Spain in Spain we touch each other we touch a
00:06:03 lot and we like it we like that our
00:06:06 partner
00:06:09 is affectionate he likes to hug us
00:06:12 kiss and such no  we like them we don't
00:06:16 like colder people much
00:06:21 more distant no this is something that here
00:06:25 is also quite important I think
00:06:29 at least for me it is for me
00:06:31 I prefer when a girl likes to
00:06:33 hug us than being close not being far away
00:06:40 and that's it  These are the five things that
00:06:44 I think are important for Spaniards
00:06:47 that we care
00:06:49 about girls and if you are a girl who
00:06:54 meets these five things I think
00:06:57 many boys in Spain will like you
00:07:02 and what is it for you  the most important
00:07:06 thing the most important thing for a couple for
00:07:10 a boyfriend a girlfriend what it is
00:07:13 tell me tell me below in the
00:07:15 comments okay come see you later

00:02:44 late at night and the
00:02:48 administration believes that  there are better uses
00:02:52 of your personal time how to spend it at
00:02:53 home with your family it would be a shame if
00:02:56 something happened to your family or while
00:02:59 you are in the laboratory working on an
00:03:01 unapproved project ok but there is
00:03:03 no information doctor daniel sans
00:03:06 well i put it here  just in case
00:03:08 then if there is a crystal here
00:03:11 in re filomatic there is a chain
00:03:13 then yes I can touch things I
00:03:17 can't do things like that well this
00:03:19 is useless  there is a neurotoxin button
00:03:25 okay but I'm not outside but
00:03:29 it affects me anyway
00:03:32 I'm not dying I think breathe
00:03:35 breathe breathe out
00:03:38 I'm not dead good then again okay it
00:03:44 detects me now I'm not going to clean the
00:03:46 glass good I have other things I
00:03:48 have drinks and such  I don't know if I can
00:03:51 shoot and catch something if I can catch
00:03:54 things
00:03:59 on glass on paper while new things are
00:04:02 happening here nothing happens a sandwich
00:04:05 there is something that is this I ca
00:04:10 n't catch it not on fire and here I can catch
00:04:13 this no no no no no no no
00:04:18 possible delivery systems possible to
00:04:21 disperse the virus
00:04:24 this had to
00:04:27 burn me the mine look
00:04:31 the cleaning service calls today that's it it
00:04:34 's just that go man here I can
00:04:38 burn this
00:04:41 look what it says now
00:04:43 is not the same but only
00:04:46 the paper appears burned no  there's nothing here interesting thing
00:04:48 ok there's a fire here i
00:04:53 have chemicals i can mix
00:04:55 i can open
00:05:03 it i can't open it and break it
00:05:07 i can burn it
00:05:11 and
00:05:15 lasers somehow i have to  r see see
00:05:19 the lasers that
00:05:21 's it that's it you can
00:05:23 start over ok I have to make smoke some
00:05:27 kind of smoke
00:05:29 I don't know if I can get something else here steal
00:05:32 something else
00:05:34 there there are different handles to
00:05:37 open different products ok come on
00:05:41 this I know if it works  You're welcome to take the
00:05:45 chemical products but well then
00:05:49 I'm not talking here
00:05:53 like the sandwich
00:05:59 here I bring this here possible delivery systems
00:06:02 submarine plane balloon there is
00:06:05 nothing interesting with this either but
00:06:08 this yes I have done something before I have
00:06:10 done the ignition  I accidentally
00:06:14 don't know how I did it to light the
00:06:15 fire I used this there man
00:06:21 I can break
00:06:23 austral that puts there
00:06:27 surprisingly flammable
00:06:30 here I can go up and down this can
00:06:34 go up as much as I know I don't know how to light the
00:06:37 fire for now let's assume that
00:06:40 the fire is not necessary because before I
00:06:42 burned the paper but it has not been
00:06:46 of any use ok I shoot
00:06:50 choose this 2
00:06:54 yes
00:06:56 then
00:06:58 oh
00:07:00 here yes I can shoot for
00:07:04 not us  This is useless
00:07:10 I don't know how I did it to light
00:07:12 the fire
00:07:14 oysters and it hit the laser
00:07:17 I don't know up here I mean if it's very
00:07:20 high I touch it
00:07:22 and here's one here very close
00:07:25 this time I'm going to shoot things I'm going to
00:07:28 shoot a ping ping come on then
00:07:33 here
00:07:37 nothing
00:07:43 there nothing and nothing happens but now
00:07:46 I'm seeing a bit of
00:07:48 the lasers here not many and don't
00:07:52 talk there okay but it only lasts a while here
00:07:58 we have there to pass a card
00:08:01 okay
00:08:04 sandwich
00:08:06 or spray with the spray I can see the
00:08:09 lasers very well if we don't have to
00:08:12 ask the people who make
00:08:15 the series not to sell them to
00:08:17 villains ok then what do I want to
00:08:22 do I would like to open that thing that can
00:08:26 be opened no we don't have the  offices out
00:08:27 there I think not I think it can be
00:08:30 opened okay
00:08:32 here
00:08:34 a card
00:08:36 here there is no school does it
00:08:39 okay
00:08:41 and a card I'll go through here
00:08:48 how easy
00:08:50 once you know what you have to do it's
00:08:52 easy
00:08:57 money
00:08:59 100 only dollars
00:09:02 take  dine  ro
00:09:06 and money for whoever wants it,
00:09:09 there is money,
00:09:14 we have the chemical elements,
00:09:18 what do I do with this, it doesn't do anything, it doesn't
00:09:21 go down, and if you go back
00:09:24 to the refills, it refilled it automatically
00:09:26 or perhaps it refills it, okay,
00:09:30 so I can put this here, no, this is
00:09:33 quite clear and I can fill something that I fill I
00:09:37 fill the cup I fill the cup
00:09:41 of coffee come on
00:09:45 oh
00:09:47 what has happened
00:09:48 to bad chemistry the chemicals have exploded
00:09:52 go good man
00:09:55 come action
00:09:58 so so so
00:09:59 from here like now this
00:10:06 and here I take the leader
00:10:11 I bring it and  then over here
00:10:15 here it's okay
00:10:19 to spray I leave them here and here my
00:10:24 sandwich
00:10:30 and then
00:10:32 what about these are
00:10:35 you leaving are you going to turn on or not I don't know how to
00:10:38 turn on
00:10:40 here I have this
00:10:46 good now nothing happens
00:10:48 that I don't know why it's the first time
00:10:50 The fire has lit and it doesn't
00:10:51 light up
00:10:53 okay then the products that you put
00:10:56 here 0 3 wii there are tubes there are things
00:11:01 going through the tubes I'm going to shoot
00:11:05 like this to test they don't break but here
00:11:11 this
00:11:13 this pair  It looks like the kind of thing that
00:11:15 could be put here no I don't know I don't know if it
00:11:18 just fit this doesn't quite
00:11:21 fit very well but here it will fit
00:11:23 and now I can play here
00:11:27 it scans and sends it
00:11:31 ok
00:11:36 the virus is stable the chemical effect is
00:11:39 negligible ok  to this I can open and
00:11:43 close
00:11:45 ok I have I don't have green if it has opened
00:11:48 it will give me 1 green if it gives me a green one but
00:11:51 the yellow one is missing ok how do I break the
00:11:55 chain how can I break the chain that
00:11:58 I have here money will not help me and here
00:12:01 I have not tried the  another closet the other
00:12:04 locker here there is another another locker what
00:12:07 is this
00:12:08 in it affects the copper if I put he art and
00:12:13 okay it's turning and the red
00:12:19 1711 of 3 I don't know I have to find a
00:12:24 correspondence between
00:12:25 the numbers and the letters ok let's see
00:12:30 for mom
00:12:33 well here there are colors the y is red
00:12:38 the y is red art I don't know if I don't know nn it
00:12:42 's yellow art and red
00:12:46 ok well this gives us some
00:12:48 information that it says here and
00:12:51 nothing and here it doesn't give us any more
00:12:54 information
00:12:55 ok what  more we have we have books
00:12:59 laser
00:13:03 security facilities open open the book
00:13:11 I can't let people float here to
00:13:14 see you more than chemistry
00:13:21 but I can't open it I can't see
00:13:23 what the book says wow man that's
00:13:26 precisely what would be good for me
00:13:29 topics to be a
00:13:32 good
00:13:35 to help  to the evil person
00:13:39 secret formulas and me and you okay i don't know if this
00:13:43 is any use but i know for now it
00:13:46 doesn't seem to be any use we have money
00:13:48 and the money well who knows maybe it
00:13:51 will be of some use in the future i
00:13:53 need this formula i need hill ar and
00:13:56 and  the greek red so i need the
00:13:59 red for sure now the others no idea
00:14:03 so how can i find out how
00:14:06 can you find out what it is i know it's not
00:14:09 yellow
00:14:11 and it's not nn it's not wait and it's not purple
00:14:16 so i need green red or blue it's
00:14:22 3
00:14:24 and  It's not even purple and yellow I'm going to
00:14:29 try it like this then
00:14:32 I'm going to knock on the outlet and see if it comes out it
00:14:35 's she hits me in the bottle she gives me the
00:14:38 ok ok ok it comes out it's very good
00:14:41 this is for corrosion of the copper of the
00:14:45 copper I break it here it's okay
00:14:49 or if it hasn't worked it wasn't close
00:14:53 but it has worked
00:15:00 and they have seen me ok ok it's okay I
00:15:05 'm here
00:15:09 they have approved to close it hasn't helped
00:15:12 but they have seen that I was cleaning
00:15:14 and they have already  They are happy, they
00:15:17 don't care if the whole window is broken,
00:15:20 that glass has also been broken, well
00:15:22 come on
00:15:24 explosions explosions nn gg
00:15:29 and the smoke is air
00:15:33 so I'm going to open this not yet
00:15:36 open this there are many things I
00:15:38 haven't tried yet
00:15:40 ok
00:15:42 that's cold then  I want
00:15:45 and deliver I want to do what I want to do
00:15:49 I want him to explode
00:15:53 the virus ok
00:15:55 and neutralize the virus 'burn
00:15:57 after reading'
00:15:59 but what else I can't burn it here I
00:16:02 don't know why it has turned on how can I
00:16:03 turn it on yes
00:16:06 if I don't have a fire
00:16:12 I don't know if  I have played playing and playing
00:16:15 just okay so I have
00:16:19 to burn this but I don't know if burning is of any use
00:16:21 the really good thing is to
00:16:23 eliminate the tracks maybe now it
00:16:25 seems that I am a clean limp  ia windows
00:16:28 ok that's cold i'm going to fill
00:16:32 this i can just throw something
00:16:35 explosive in there and up ok nn gg nn it's
00:16:39 yellow and hey it
00:16:42 's one of the ones i've put before it's not
00:16:45 red it's blue or green
00:16:48 let's try blue and if it's not blue  it will be
00:16:51 yellow and green yellow and green
00:16:54 remember if this doesn't work we have
00:16:57 to do yellow and green it
00:17:01 explodes or something I don't know you can't do
00:17:05 something
00:17:07 I can
00:17:08 shoot it
00:17:12 ok
00:17:15 stuffed
00:17:17 I don't know yellow and green
00:17:22 okay again from the beginning okay
00:17:26 now I know what it is  I have to
00:17:28 do so we won't have too many
00:17:30 problems I think
00:17:35 so I open here we have the card I
00:17:40 take the spray
00:17:43 margins
00:17:46 for here and now
00:17:49 here it's
00:17:52 fine so we
00:17:56 need to
00:17:58 fill in those and double
00:18:02 everything except yellow and lilac
00:18:07 this is this blue
00:18:13 and with this  What were we doing with this, there
00:18:16 are the colors, here you are telling me
00:18:18 the colors, the numbers, and maybe the
00:18:21 lowest number is blue, okay, not clear, but
00:18:24 the numbers I already know, it was filled in here,
00:18:26 I know that  blue is number three I don't know
00:18:29 the letters so if the letters have
00:18:32 something they are explained somewhere
00:18:35 so with this what was this
00:18:39 for for this I
00:18:44 didn't have to shoot very well so
00:18:49 open this fill in
00:18:52 and today
00:18:58 hello
00:19:00 I haven't seen  nobody I don't know where
00:19:02 they've seen me from
00:19:04 so the other option is
00:19:08 I hear noises I don't know what noises they are
00:19:15 I don't know what was here here there is this but
00:19:19 this didn't tell me anything
00:19:21 spread the virus
00:19:24 here was something else
00:19:26 worth this and I'll put this here  very well
00:19:33 this is of no use a sandwich
00:19:37 I think that almost history now
00:19:40 I am not very clear what I have to do with
00:19:42 the virus maybe I have to send it
00:19:45 there then explosion nn gg
00:19:51 nn it is yellow
00:19:55 before we have tried blue and it was not it will be
00:19:58 green
00:20:00 there in it
00:20:04 doesn't look very good I don't have I can bring
00:20:07 this here it is everything here it's all very
00:20:11 well then
00:20:14 nn gg it's
00:20:17 yellow and blue
00:20:19 okay okay okay
00:20:21 give
00:20:25 it to me I'll put it I'll put it here let's
00:20:29 see what happens let's
00:20:31 see what happens
00:20:38 destroyed if it's already ok
00:20:42 No, it wasn't this,
00:20:48 wow, men,
00:20:50 I can't make it explode because
00:20:52 then I'm dying, I'm dying, and
00:20:56 the whole city surely dies, okay, and
00:21:01 although
00:21:05 I don't think I have to do this, but
00:21:07 well, then
00:21:09 I need all but the purple and
00:21:13 yellow,
00:21:14 all except then.  green red no or
00:21:17 purple no red and blue
00:21:21 okay
00:21:23 and this is for copper
00:21:28 I'm going to bring this too
00:21:35 come on let's clean
00:21:39 how easy
00:21:42 you can fool us very easily there is a
00:21:45 glass I don't know if we know what it is that
00:21:48 can destroy
00:21:51 the virus there to
00:21:55 disperse  the virus delivery systems
00:21:59 toxic rain
00:22:02 oh
00:22:03 a paper plane okay
00:22:09 well
00:22:11 this makes Friday
00:22:14 bad let's
00:22:15 see
00:22:22 like this I was saving the world do
00:22:25 n't forget okay
00:22:27 so I know how to make explosions
00:22:30 but right now there is nothing I want
00:22:32 to explode
00:22:34 and here I can cool  things this lady
00:22:39 was doing things in her free time
00:22:43 am
00:22:44 and here she explains how to do different
00:22:48 things
00:22:50 to this is what mom was doing
00:22:53 ok well I'm going to do it from
00:22:56 mom  from mom it's my forgiveness to lilac yellow
00:23:02 and red
00:23:06 I'm going to do it from mom to see what happens
00:23:13 to see if well I'm going to die
00:23:15 surely but
00:23:18 I know what
00:23:19 so I tell her the antivirus
00:23:22 or they're going to launch the antivirus no no no no
00:23:25 no
00:23:31 oysters maybe and  I could put it maybe there I
00:23:34 had the opportunity to put it
00:23:38 what do
00:23:39 I do, that's it I can't do anything a
00:23:45 thousand yen
00:23:47 now
00:23:51 here
00:23:53 ok
00:24:00 I can do the bomb al
00:24:04 how is the bomb
00:24:06 how is the bomb
00:24:08 nn gg
00:24:10 nn yellow blue yellow blue
00:24:24 I have the copper
00:24:27 the copper that is all except the yellow
00:24:32 and the lilac
00:24:33 this is for the chain
00:24:37 no this is the pump here I have a pump
00:24:41 this is for the chain
00:24:52 this is for the chain and now I can
00:24:55 remove this
00:25:09 no
00:25:14 or what a bad good good at least now  I know
00:25:18 what I have to do I do
00:25:22 n't know if you have seen me because
00:25:24 the camera has been turned off I had been recording for a long time
00:25:26 but
00:25:29 I know what I have to do so the
00:25:33 first thing is the sandwich that makes me
00:25:35 hungry ok then the sprite and take the card out
00:25:41 of here
00:25:43 security
00:25:46 and put  rla here without touching the lasers very
00:25:50 well what is important here this is
00:25:53 the antivirus okay this is the table of
00:25:57 elements I am going to put it here because
00:26:00 then later the virus shoots out
00:26:03 here this is the rocket that is going to launch
00:26:06 the virus and I have me  hurry
00:26:09 so I don't need
00:26:12 this I do need this because I'm going to
00:26:16 need the copper and heart and
00:26:21 and aer and it's blue green red
00:26:25 so green green is here green
00:26:30 blue
00:26:32 and red
00:26:35 blue green red this is for the copper
00:26:40 but
00:26:43 but  I'm going to do two I'm going to do two
00:26:46 for copper, so
00:26:49 here's another one. They've seen me today
00:26:53 cleaning up
00:26:56 a government,
00:26:58 okay, then go
00:27:01 back to green, red and blue,
00:27:06 this is going to be for copper again,
00:27:10 and I don't think I have to do copper again
00:27:14 shoot well I'm going to leave it here so I'll
00:27:17 need the copper and then I'll
00:27:20 need an exclusive I don't need I
00:27:25 need antivirus I need 2 antivirus
00:27:28 lilac yellow or red lilac
00:27:32 yellow
00:27:34 and red
00:27:36 this is an antivirus so
00:27:38 I'm going to put this in order  I'll put one here and
00:27:41 another here first the top one then
00:27:43 the bottom one and now again it really
00:27:47 is very easy you just have to know
00:27:49 what to do because there are many things that are useful to
00:27:51 us they are useless
00:27:53 this tells me what I'm going to do
00:27:56 burn it just in case it's
00:27:59 okay then this is another antivirus
00:28:03 if I put it here and the evil lord tells me
00:28:08 we've caught you we've blocked the
00:28:11 attempt to neutralize this
00:28:13 is useless I don't know if I can freeze I can
00:28:16 cool the coffee or that it's not okay
00:28:20 then I  take it out
00:28:23 and now you will see that it will be good to be able

161,"00:00:00 hello this is the nocilla the nocilla is a
00:00:06 bit similar to nutella
00:00:11 the nocilla is the version
00:00:14 is the nutella from spain'
00:00:19 the nocilla appeared appeared in me
00:00:28 1967 there was a gentleman a
00:00:32 spanish gentleman who saw the nutella and thought
00:00:39 I'm going to do the same and told him  put or nocilla
00:00:45 the flavor of nutella is cocoa
00:00:51 cocoa is used to make chocolate they
00:00:56 have a cocoa and hazelnut flavor the
00:01:00 hazelnuts are crunchy
00:01:03 and
00:01:05 are very good so the nocilla is
00:01:09 eaten a lot by children children are
00:01:13 people little boys
00:01:16 and girls
00:01:20 are  children from not being fingers
00:01:26 fz
00:01:28 years of age from small to
00:01:31 bigger bigger are children children
00:01:35 like to eat nocilla
00:01:38 and we adults also like to
00:01:41 eat nocilla
00:01:44 I think that
00:01:46 in many places in the world
00:01:51 every day they eat three times  more or less
00:01:57 between 6 and 9 in the morning there is a
00:02:01 meal breakfast then between 12 it
00:02:06 does not depend on the place between 11
00:02:10 between 11 and 2 there is one more meal and
00:02:15 then before going to sleep maybe  More
00:02:19 between 6
00:02:20 between 6 and 10 there is a last
00:02:25 meal three meals every day every day
00:02:28 but in Spain not in Spain there are four
00:02:33 meals we have
00:02:38 breakfast lunch and then here we have a
00:02:42 snack
00:02:44 and at the end dinner the snack is eaten
00:02:50 more  or less at 5 at 5 or 6
00:02:55 we eat a snack in spain in spain you
00:03:00 don't eat dinner you don't eat at 6 you
00:03:05 eat more or less between 9 between 9
00:03:11 and 10
00:03:13 more or less we eat dinner
00:03:15 then  here
00:03:18 the snack there are many children who go to
00:03:24 school and then come home from
00:03:28 school they come home and then they eat
00:03:33 the snack and many
00:03:38 children in Spain for snack eat
00:03:42 nutella so the nutella is eaten with
00:03:47 bread this is bread but when eating nutella
00:03:52 many  sometimes it is eaten with bread with loaf bread
00:03:57 a loaf like this is also bread the
00:04:01 same as this bread so in the bread you
00:04:05 take
00:04:07 the nocilla
00:04:09 it opens wherever you speak it opens here
00:04:18 it opens
00:04:21 look look look look it
00:04:25 's very similar to nutella then
00:04:28 with the  knife is caught a little and  in the
00:04:35 bread according to such
00:04:42 and even the corners perfect very well and
00:04:46 in the knife it remains a bit so I
00:04:49 like to put it in the corner it's ok very
00:04:53 well and then you eat it
00:05:00 oh it
00:05:04 's very good
00:05:06 come see you later

00:00:05 hello today I'm going to talk about couples
00:00:10 marriages and children you are
00:00:16 you are married married
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:25 in Spain many people get married get married
00:00:31 more and more and more older others
00:00:36 older
00:00:38 in spain men men get
00:00:42 married  on average at 37 at 37 years old
00:00:51 and women on average at 34
00:00:58 and getting older and older
00:01:01 before the boy-girl couples first got
00:01:10 married got married
00:01:13 and then went to
00:01:19 live together but now not now the
00:01:25 majority  first they live they live together and
00:01:30 then
00:01:32 they get married they get married
00:01:36 and there are couples who live together for
00:01:40 more than ten ten years this is not a year well
00:01:48 ten ten years they live together in the
00:01:53 same house and then they get married
00:01:58 and also now many people first
00:02:02 have children children  and then
00:02:09 they get married
00:02:12 yes yes and people get married they get married
00:02:18 because it's better for taxes
00:02:21 you have to pay a percentage of
00:02:25 taxes
00:02:27 because based on that it's better you pay less
00:02:33 less taxes and also another thing that
00:02:38 has changed is that  before people got
00:02:42 married in the church in the church and
00:02:48 before 1978 in spain everyone
00:02:56 had to go to church but
00:03:00 after 1978
00:03:03 you can also go to the court
00:03:07 and now in 2017 only 30% of
00:03:17 weddings are in church
00:03:20 on  rest no not only in church my
00:03:24 parents my dad
00:03:27 my mom
00:03:30 me my dad my mom my parents got
00:03:33 married in court they didn't get married
00:03:38 in church no no but they got married in the
00:03:43 80's in the 80's and in the 80's
00:03:51 yes yes
00:03:53 and there were very few people who didn't get married
00:03:56 in church in the 80s but my parents
00:03:59 didn't get married in church
00:04:02 and also some couples
00:04:06 some couples get married in court
00:04:10 but later they have a banquet a
00:04:15 banquet a very big meal dancing
00:04:21 and there's  other couples
00:04:31 other couples who get married in court
00:04:35 and
00:04:38 then go
00:04:40 home go home and even and then another
00:04:45 thing that you may have seen is that
00:04:54 homosexual marriage has existed in Spain since 2000
00:04:59 5 a boy
00:05:02 can marry other boys
00:05:06 and  a girl can ca  marry another girl

00:00:25 very famous market in Barcelona to show you
00:00:29 to show you the market and it is
00:00:32 the sant joseph market
00:00:34 normally people call it la

00:00:45 de barcelona it is a street the
00:00:47 main street of barcelona where there are  many
00:00:50 tourists and well we are going to enter the
00:00:52 market and we are going to see what is in the
00:00:54 market
00:00:56 so this is a market it is not a
00:00:59 supermarket it is a place where they sell
00:01:01 fruit vegetables fish meat but this
00:01:06 this market is a little different because
00:01:09 as this Japanese gentleman said  there are a lot of
00:01:13 tourists and as you will see here there are a lot of
00:01:15 tourists a lot of people who come to
00:01:18 visit barcelona and who come to this market
00:01:20 so the things they sell are a
00:01:24 little different they are a little different from
00:01:26 those in a normal market we are going to see
00:01:29 quite normal things in a market in
00:01:32 spain but things also a little
00:01:34 different here we see a lot of chocolate
00:01:37 many types of chocolate in a
00:01:40 spanish market well there may be this type of
00:01:43 store with several  types of chocolate and
00:01:45 such but not so much but so many things
00:01:49 in this market there are many things that they
00:01:52 sell that you can buy and eat fabrics
00:01:54 at the moment not many snacks and prepared things
00:01:59 I am going to show you now that they have
00:02:02 fruit shakes and as you can see
00:02:05 there are  different fruit shakes to
00:02:09 drink at the moment that this is not
00:02:11 very common in a Spanish market
00:02:13 normally there are not usually things like this
00:02:16 prepared to start eating and at
00:02:19 that moment we see that there are mangoes there are a
00:02:23 lot of tropical fruit a lot of exotic
00:02:26 fruit there are fruit from countries  from more from more to the south
00:02:29 of warmer countries in spain look at

00:02:45 have are fruits
00:02:47 from the country, fruits that are normally
00:02:49 grown in the country, such as watermelons,
00:02:52 melons, oranges, but in this
00:02:55 market there is a lot of tropical fruit and
00:02:58 there is prepared food, a lot of food so
00:03:01 you can start eating and buying it and
00:03:04 starting it for you.  commerce but there is also

00:03:13 pigeon it has given a blow to the pigeon
00:03:15 there is also usual food from markets
00:03:18 in Spain such as sausages
00:03:21 sausages like chorizos salchichones
00:03:25 well the one that is not sausage  but
00:03:27 cheese is also on the market in a
00:03:29 Spanish market it is common to find
00:03:32 many types of cheese, not and ham of
00:03:35 course ham serrano ham
00:03:38 ibérico ham ham of many types but

00:04:30 small portions small plates of
00:04:32 food to share to share with
00:04:35 other people we see that there are also
00:04:37 small portions of ham
00:04:40 of cheese sausage to snack on to
00:04:43 eat yours while you walk while you
00:04:45 walk around the market
00:04:48 and many good fruit smoothies and
00:04:51 such that it is not normal to find fruit already
00:04:54 cut fruit already prepared to
00:04:57 eat it in a market in a
00:04:58 Spanish market that  normally you can't find
00:05:02 meat raw meat meat that is cut for you

00:05:44 I don't know if we are going to see something something special
00:05:47 something a little good this is
00:05:52 in the butcher shop especially what else
00:05:55 there is because it is chicken beef
00:05:58 lamb and pork it is not the most common
00:06:01 but sometimes we find some things
00:06:04 a little different but not so
00:06:07 common
00:06:09 and here here I've been through it before I've already
00:06:12 seen something a bit uninteresting it
00:06:15 has a kid kid meat
00:06:18 kid it's goat
00:06:22 a goat well they have kid meat meat
00:06:25 a small goat a tiny goat

00:06:43 see if I can find the fishmongers.
00:06:46 shops of spices many different spices that
00:06:48 look very good
00:06:51 and they have small aces and packs of
00:06:53 combinations combinations of spices
00:06:58 which is also not something very common
00:07:00 seems very aimed at
00:07:02 tourists but still has a few items quite a few
00:07:07 traditional items from the traditional Spanish market
00:07:11 not the  The building
00:07:14 is a historic building, it is a very old building that
00:07:17 still preserves the construction,
00:07:21 I don't know if it was the first time this market was built,
00:07:23 but it was a long time
00:07:25 ago when it was used in the market and
00:07:29 people from here came to buy it.
00:07:31 from Barcelona around here we have that
00:07:34 we have salty
00:07:37 here are the fallen letters I don't even know what
00:07:40 they say to put fish on them but they are not
00:07:43 fish they are some kind of oil or
00:07:46 well fish or salty fish so they
00:07:50 have some canned fish
00:07:52 preserved with salt
00:07:54 more fruits over there  here they have seafood
00:07:59 squid and cuttlefish different types of
00:08:02 prawns for christmas
00:08:04 we eat a lot of prawns  As and now Christmas
00:08:07 is the day after tomorrow in two days
00:08:10 so let's move the stamina oysters
00:08:16 so that at Christmas they sell a
00:08:18 lot of seafood this is the barnacle this in
00:08:22 Spain is also famous for being expensive
00:08:24 for costing a lot of money a lot of
00:08:27 money and it's not there  It's not very good, it's not
00:08:30 very good. The truth is, I don't
00:08:33 like the barnacle very much. I've tried it, but it doesn't
00:08:37 have much flavor. It's just expensive, it
00:08:39 costs money.
00:08:47 stalls
00:08:53 and cashews cashews macadamias
00:08:58 dates
00:09:00 in the mixture of nuts
00:09:04 chocolate plus chocolate there are many a
00:09:07 few chocolate stalls a
00:09:09 few stalls chocolate stalls and
00:09:13 as I said before tropical fruit it is not
00:09:16 very common to see this type of fruit in
00:09:18 Spanish markets and this store too
00:09:23 it's a bit interesting blindfolded
00:09:27 if you don't like to see things a bit
00:09:29 shocking but here we have
00:09:34 sheep heads lamb brains  s languages
00:09:38 this we are not going to give you guts not the
00:09:42 inside the inside of the animals
00:09:46 tongue liver the heads of lamb
00:09:51 quite quite shocking
00:09:55 and a lot of sausages a lot a lot of
00:09:58 different sausage the type of you are out
00:10:01 different sausages and then that that is
00:10:05 usual it is quite normal in  the same
00:10:07 store in the same stall sell
00:10:12 sausages and sell cheese understand it in
00:10:15 the same store
00:10:17 and we have more or less seen what is there
00:10:21 stalls like this with a little more this which is
00:10:24 good
00:10:26 I am not sure if they sell this with
00:10:29 a little variety  They have quite a bit of everything,
00:10:35 but I'm sure there are some more stalls
00:10:38 like this, a bit strange, but more or less as
00:10:41 if only what there
00:10:43 is is the most common thing in all Spanish markets,
00:10:46 which is fruit, vegetables,
00:10:50 we haven't seen vegetables, it's true,
00:10:51 vegetables.  There has been a lack of meat,
00:10:54 fish, cheese, plus the most common and
00:10:58 well, here we are again
00:11:00 at the entrance to the market and it is
00:11:03 a good place to say goodbye to
00:11:06 say goodbye.  s and I hope you liked

133,"00:00:07 ah
00:00:09 now you know flamenco right I
00:00:13 think that if most people
00:00:15 know flamenco flamenco
00:00:19 this flamenco not this flamenco
00:00:22 flamenco includes singing la la la
00:00:26 because and dancing
00:00:31 and it is known all over the world it
00:00:36 comes from andalusia it originates from
00:00:41 andalusia
00:00:43 And above all, most of those who
00:00:46 played flamenco ballads, flamenco
00:00:48 before, at the beginning, were gypsies,
00:00:53 gypsies, who have lived in Spain for many centuries
00:00:58 and since the 18th century,
00:01:04 which is the 1700s, whatever
00:01:09 it was, was already played and  Flamenco was danced
00:01:13 but at first it was played it was sung
00:01:17 it was danced with friends with your friends with
00:01:21 the family not with a
00:01:24 father a mother and then the children with the
00:01:29 family
00:01:31 it was played it was danced flamenco and
00:01:34 with friends
00:01:36 but in the year 1881 in Seville for
00:01:43 first time
00:01:46 a bar opens a place where people go to
00:01:48 drink to drink beer wine with tables with
00:01:55 chairs
00:01:56 chairs
00:01:58 where people go to drink from a
00:02:00 bottle to a bottle glass people go to
00:02:04 drink and they go to watch  a show there was
00:02:08 a stage and there was a person
00:02:12 sitting here playing the guitar not playing
00:02:17 the guitar it's a show and people
00:02:20 went to see flamenco play it was the
00:02:22 first time in 1881
00:02:25 so for the first time there was a
00:02:28 person who charged money
00:02:33 to sing for  playing and they became
00:02:35 professionals for the first time they began to
00:02:38 see people professional singers and dancers
00:02:41 that I know was their job
00:02:44 their job and they gave them money so
00:02:48 flamenco
00:02:49 flamenco music to play you use the
00:02:53 guitar
00:02:54 the guitar you use the guitar I don't know
00:02:58 if you  you know but the guitar is a
00:03:00 spanish spanish invention yes yes and from
00:03:04 spain then it was exported to other
00:03:07 countries
00:03:09 also there are castanets that are like
00:03:12 that they play
00:03:19 the cajón the cajón is like this a box a
00:03:25 box
00:03:26 a wooden box the wood comes from
00:03:30 the  trees from their tree and with this
00:03:34 wood is made well
00:03:38 with the wood the drawer is made
00:03:41 here a person sits
00:03:44 with his hands touching dad papa
00:03:49 little pepe and inside the drawer h  oh strings
00:03:59 here there are strings inside no they don't look the
00:04:03 same as the guitar strings the
00:04:06 guitar also has strings
00:04:09 here the cajón inside also has
00:04:12 strings then they also use the palms
00:04:19 and tapping
00:04:22 look look
00:04:27 for the tapping they use the shoes the
00:04:30 shoes too  They are an instrument like that,
00:04:34 well there are two people who are the most
00:04:37 famous flamenco in Spain, one of
00:04:41 them is camarón camarón, who is this man, he
00:04:44 was a cantaor who sang or do
00:04:48 you want to listen to him
00:04:51 listen to listen
00:04:53 [Music]
00:04:56 there is the reflection
00:05:00 in my bed
00:05:04 and
00:05:07 what do you think  We like it and then there's
00:05:11 also Paco de Lucía Paco de Lucía yes,
00:05:15 a man too who
00:05:18 learned to play the guitar at a very young age and he plays
00:05:22 phenomenally. It's incredible to look at
00:05:27 [Music]
00:05:40 Now flamenco is very, very
00:05:44 popular throughout Spain'
00:05:47 in many places  from spain

00:05:52 expect flamenco shows and many

00:06:37 people learn how to play  they study
00:06:40 with books listening to reading music
00:06:45 practicing playing and dancing
00:06:49 but there is a place where there are more schools
00:06:53 than in spain another country and that country is
00:06:58 japan in japan there are more schools
00:07:02 especially of flamenco dance than in
00:07:07 spain

00:02:29 the studio a bit and see what they have to see
00:02:32 what things they have
00:02:35 here they have brought me to this I was
00:02:38 here well I can move things

00:02:44 all things wherever
00:02:47 I want and I  They have brought here a cart there is a
00:02:50 cart with different things that I asked
00:02:54 that I have asked to let me
00:02:56 use and here is a tripod there is a
00:03:00 camera there is a big camera
00:03:04 good it is  free so I thought well
00:03:08 I'm going to ask I'm going to ask for different
00:03:10 cameras different material to try it
00:03:13 to see to see to learn how to use it and
00:03:17 to see if I don't know if the
00:03:20 quality improves if the video has better quality
00:03:23 now I'm using the camera than I am
00:03:25 I always use what I normally use to
00:03:28 record my videos to record my face
00:03:31 but today I will also try using these
00:03:34 cameras two more cameras that they have left me
00:03:39 and to see if there is a difference yes yes I
00:03:44 don't know if it looks better and if it sounds better
00:03:46 because they also let me use microphones
00:03:50 we also have microphones and let's see
00:03:54 what's up
00:03:56 then if another tripod here here is
00:04:00 a TV a television yes I don't know maybe it's

160,"00:00:00 and
00:00:02 this is me my name is Pablo and now
00:00:07 I am 32 years old a long time ago when
00:00:14 I was little
00:00:16 when I was I was more or less 12
00:00:21 12 years old I ate the nutella that made
00:00:26 bread bread a slice of bread made me
00:00:32 44 slices in a  plate this
00:00:36 this is a plate that made a
00:00:39 large plate with four slices and
00:00:43 put nocilla nocilla
00:00:48 on all 4
00:00:50 and then put them in the microwave the
00:00:55 microwave has buttons a
00:00:59 tyc screen and inside
00:01:02 it gets hot
00:01:07 and there is a plate that spins
00:01:11 tim and it ran out so he made me four
00:01:15 slices on a plate
00:01:18 a plate with bread bread bread with nocilla
00:01:22 nocilla nocilla nocilla and hot it
00:01:28 is very very good
00:01:31 and there is one thing about the nutella it is very
00:01:35 good which is that when you eat it you
00:01:39 eat it all  and the glass is finished it
00:01:44 can be used to drink
00:01:47 here I have a glass of nocilla that there is
00:01:52 no nocilla anymore and
00:01:56 this glass is big and this glass is
00:01:59 small
00:02:01 and this one looks from the sea I have glasses
00:02:07 there are many different glasses look
00:02:13 look this glass is not  it is  from mario mario not
00:02:18 mario there are different glasses you can make
00:02:21 collections many different types
00:02:24 so you have a 2 3 4 5 all the
00:02:29 glasses you make a collection
00:02:32 there are many different collections
00:02:35 for a long time they have made glasses different steps
00:02:39 different different there are primary there are
00:02:42 these that they do now and before there were
00:02:45 Other different ones you want to see, look,
00:02:49 look, these are glasses from a long time ago
00:02:54 there are many, many different ones
00:02:58 and when I was little in my house in my
00:03:01 house all the glasses to drink water
00:03:05 were nocilla all nocilla
00:03:08 nocilla nocilla all the glasses glass
00:03:13 a glass
00:03:15 basso glass glass  glass they were all made of
00:03:20 nutella all the steps were made of nutella
00:03:24 because nutella is not nutella
00:03:29 you eat it you dig it and the bottle has
00:03:35 to be thrown away it cannot be used to drink
00:03:38 water
00:03:39 I think that in Spain a
00:03:47 lot of people remember the ads  on the
00:03:52 telly on the telly that put nocilla
00:03:57 ta ta ta ta you want to see them
00:04:00 look
00:04:02 listen here all the cocoa creams
00:04:05 look the same to you  no and there is already one
00:04:10 that you like more than the others
00:04:12 now you think about your favorite cream and
00:04:17 accepting the best for them
00:04:19 does not cost a little more, do not fail them
00:04:23 no if not if there is no other like it
00:04:28 there is only one way to  make nocilla
00:04:30 [Music]
00:04:34 caracas
00:04:36 [Music]
00:04:44 or yes
00:04:49 what memories when I was little
00:04:52 we used to see those commercials on TV in the
00:04:56 song when they sing the lullaby they sing
00:05:00 hazelnut cocoa milk and sugar
00:05:07 and it no
00:05:09 longer says
00:05:14 hazelnut cocoa milk I know
00:05:16 and sugar sugar is a  powder also
00:05:21 like cocoa but cocoa is
00:05:28 brown or black in color and white sugar
00:05:32 is used because it has a
00:05:36 sweet taste it is put
00:05:38 in the coffee the coffee is put on appointments
00:05:44 that you open
00:05:46 and sugar is put
00:05:49 but the truth is that to me the  I
00:05:54 like nutella more than the nocilla
00:05:58 the nocilla is good but the best
00:06:02 you have tried the nocilla
00:06:06 you have to try it until it is very tasty
00:06:10 come see you later

00:02:15 and on the way there was a store, a
00:02:22 kiosk where you could buy
00:02:26 pastries, so when I went to school I
00:02:30 bought  I had a Boeing Ko and then at 11
00:02:36 I ate it inside the bollicao
00:02:40 there were stickers that you peel off and

167,"00:00:02 Hello, today I am going to tell you a story
00:00:05 that when
00:00:08 I lived in Japan
00:00:15 and once I went
00:00:18 to the mountains,
00:00:25 I talk
00:00:29 and my friend,
00:00:34 for example, Hayashi,
00:00:40 and we went to the mountains to snowboard.
00:00:44 Snowboarding is made with a board.
00:00:49 A board
00:00:51 is made.  when it's cold it
00:00:54 falls snow
00:00:59 hyde snow snow snow snow
00:01:03 snow in winter when it's cold and the
00:01:06 whole mountain
00:01:10 turns white it
00:01:12 's very beautiful
00:01:16 no
00:01:18 this happened in 2012 i lived
00:01:29 i lived in kyoto hayashi i
00:01:34 lived in nagoya
00:01:44 and
00:01:46 we had to go in  train
00:01:52 by train
00:01:55 by train it's like this
00:02:01 and there's like that I had to go by train
00:02:05 to here
00:02:14 and from the train with a road
00:02:25 and we go up the mountain
00:02:28 by the road and we go by bus
00:02:32 bus is very big
00:02:39 and goes from the train from the station
00:02:41 train up to the slopes
00:02:45 these are ski slopes
00:02:48 here to the people the people doing snow
00:02:56 skiing snow skiing
00:02:59 so we had to
00:03:03 be at the station at nine because at nine the
00:03:08 bus would go up and there is only one bus  e
00:03:12 buses there is one at nine and that's it
00:03:18 then I
00:03:21 was waiting for the train at the kyoto station at
00:03:27 the station
00:03:33 me
00:03:35 and I was waiting waiting for the train
00:03:41 there was an indicator the train plus 20
00:03:48 minutes 20 minutes late oysters what am I going
00:03:53 to do if I arrive  here 20 20 minutes
00:03:58 late the bus will already go up and
00:04:03 I won't be able to catch it what do I do what do I do
00:04:06 then at the station
00:04:08 I took another train a train
00:04:14 in japan there is a train called
00:04:18 shinkansen that goes very fast it goes over
00:04:24 300 kilometers  per hour at more than 300
00:04:29 kilometers per hour it goes very fast
00:04:31 so I paid more money to get
00:04:35 on this train and get here sooner
00:04:39 so I arrived and my friend Hayashi
00:04:45 wasn't at the station I had to wait and
00:04:49 wait wait
00:04:52 855 and what if he wasn't 857  and it wasn't there
00:05:01 and finally
00:05:05 a train arrived and the train from nagoya
00:05:11 by train
00:05:13 arrived and hopefully if you came very well
00:05:18 we both got on the bus and got on
00:05:24 got on got on and we got to the
00:05:27 ski slopes on the ski slopes
00:05:31 we had to  I had to rent I didn't have a board
00:05:37 and if I didn't have a board either then on
00:05:42 the slopes there is a store
00:05:49 where they have snowboard snowboard
00:05:53 snowboard ski xxx they have
00:05:59 snowboards and they have skis you pay money and
00:06:03 they let you use them for
00:06:06 a day and then you return them so
00:06:11 we went here  but you had to pay with
00:06:15 money
00:06:17 money
00:06:18 and I only had a little money and
00:06:21 hi I also only had a
00:06:24 little money and we had to pay money
00:06:27 for the boards and also pay money
00:06:31 to use the
00:06:33 chairlift
00:06:37 like this
00:06:42 and here are some chairs and the  people get on
00:06:47 here there are no chairs
00:06:56 and the snow world snowboard ski fis and in
00:07:02 turn with this with the chairlift you go up the
00:07:06 mountain to the top but you have to pay it
00:07:10 cost too much I didn't have enough
00:07:14 money and there was like that either I didn't have
00:07:19 I didn't have enough money  I had a card I had
00:07:23 a
00:07:25 visa card
00:07:28 and there is that too I
00:07:31 also had a visa card
00:07:36 but to pay the rent you can't
00:07:40 use it smooth and
00:07:44 I don't know either to pay for the chairlift  You can use a visa
00:07:49 because oysters we didn't understand it
00:07:52 we were talking to the people here in
00:07:55 the store there were people
00:08:00 and we were talking you can't pay
00:08:02 because because I'm sorry I'm sorry
00:08:09 we were talking and we started
00:08:11 to get sad because
00:08:12 we were thinking today we won't be able to

00:08:50 With a screen to see the
00:08:56 keyboard
00:09:00 to press buttons
00:09:02 and a slot to put the card in,
00:09:07 you can put it in the slot and another slot
00:09:12 through which money comes out,
00:09:16 but to take the taxi you had to pay
00:09:19 once to go down and pay again to
00:09:23 go up.  a lot of money
00:09:27 so we didn't want to pay so much
00:09:30 money
00:09:31 so the people in the store told us
00:09:35 and on the slopes there is an office and
00:09:40 we went to the office

00:02:45 to researchers until more or less  In the
00:02:50 19th
00:02:52 century, Spanish was also written with the
00:02:55 Hebrew alphabet
00:02:57 because the Sephardic Jews lived in Spain
00:03:02 with the Sephardic
00:03:05 Jews they were Spanish Jews
00:03:07 and from the 15th century the Jews
00:03:13 had to leave Spain they had to
00:03:18 leave Spain because they were expelled
00:03:22 and
00:03:24 the Jews  They settled
00:03:28 in other parts of Europe, for example, in
00:03:33 the Balkan area of ​​Greece, and
00:03:37 these Jews who settled in this
00:03:42 geographical area in the Balkans and in
00:03:46 Greece
00:03:47 began to
00:03:50 write Spanish using the Greek alphabet.
00:03:55 Some Jews also settled in
00:03:59 bulgaria and there in the 19th century these
00:04:06 jews
00:04:08 wrote some things with e  The Cyrillic alphabet
00:04:12 with the Second World War
00:04:17 many of these Jewish communities
00:04:21 disappeared and these forms
00:04:26 of Spanish writing were lost, but a
00:04:30 large part of the Sephardic Jews of
00:04:35 the Spanish Jews who
00:04:38 survived the Second World War
00:04:43 and settled in Turkey were in
00:04:46 Turkey for  That is quite common
00:04:52 now to see documents written in Spanish
00:04:58 in the Spanish of the Sephardic Jews
00:05:02 with the Turkish variant of the Latin alphabet.
00:05:08 Today these forms of writing are in the
00:05:14 minority but there are still historical documents
00:05:20 where you can see all this variety and
00:05:25 you have seen some.  If Spanish is
00:05:29 written with another alphabet,

211,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about the letter zeta the
00:00:06 letter zeta
00:00:08 I am going to explain where it
00:00:11 comes from and what makes it
00:00:15 different makes it special especially in
00:00:20 Spanish
00:00:22 [Music]
00:00:28 hello well the letter zeta
00:00:32 the letter zeta like others  letters
00:00:36 other letters of our alphabet such
00:00:40 as c
00:00:42 just like many letters it comes from
00:00:46 Phoenician it comes from the Phoenician alphabet but
00:00:51 in Phoenician the zeta had this shape it
00:00:55 had a shape yes the same the same as
00:01:00 our capital letter i
00:01:03 and from the Phoenician alphabet it passed to the Greek to the
00:01:10 Greek  silk is given from the Greek which is the
00:01:13 same
00:01:16 as our capital letter but the
00:01:19 lower case is
00:01:22 different lower case silk is like this
00:01:27 yes upper case upper case and lower case
00:01:34 and before previously the z
00:01:39 already existed in Latin there was the z
00:01:43 but it disappeared disappeared
00:01:48 there was a time there was a time  in which
00:01:51 the zeta the zeta was not in Latin it
00:01:54 disappeared because there was a sound
00:01:59 there was
00:02:01 a Latin sound that disappeared it was
00:02:06 no longer said that is why the letter zeta
00:02:08 disappeared  It grew
00:02:11 but later Latin
00:02:16 picked up the z again picked up the y
00:02:21 the y and the z picked them up again from the
00:02:27 Greek from the Greek picked them up because there were
00:02:31 sounds there were sounds that in Latin in
00:02:35 Latin there weren't then to write
00:02:39 to write words  from the Greek they
00:02:42 took the y and they took the z and
00:02:48 that is why now the y and the z are at the end they are
00:02:54 the last ones not
00:02:58 from c
00:03:01 y and ceta are the last ones because they were
00:03:06 taken from the Greek later they were
00:03:09 taken after the z
00:03:13 we don't need it in Spanish we
00:03:16 need it to  To be able to say
00:03:20 zazo
00:03:23 a
00:03:27 we need the z if we did not have
00:03:30 the z we could not
00:03:36 also say the z is necessary for other
00:03:40 reasons
00:03:41 for example in mathematics
00:03:45 we have the x
00:03:49 the y and the z the z
00:03:56 in space three-dimensional space
00:03:59 we have x and z we
00:04:02 also have the z  the clear lining is needed for
00:04:07 the lining
00:04:11 if there were no z the lining
00:04:15 would not exist and for example to write the
00:04:18 name of a place in california
00:04:22 called six days ix yes yes yes  How strange I don't
00:04:28 terrazzo the name i
00:04:31 and that's it the z the poor thing doesn't
00:04:35 have many uses it is not used for many
00:04:39 things no it
00:04:42 cannot be it may be that in Spain it may
00:04:47 be that in Spain we write the z
00:04:52 differently than you do
00:04:54 Because in Spain many times
00:04:58 we cross the z like this we make a line
00:05:05 a line in the middle z yes yes yes and it seems
00:05:11 that we cross the z
00:05:15 in Spain Spain France Germany Italy
00:05:20 yes yes
00:05:22 only in
00:05:26 western continental europe and I don't know I don't know why I have
00:05:31 I have searched I have searched because we crossed it
00:05:35 but it is not very clear but surely
00:05:40 it is surely to distinguish it to
00:05:44 make it different from the two of the number two
00:05:49 the number two if you write fast it is
00:05:53 similar it is similar to the z
00:05:56 that is why in mathematics in math they

015,"00:00:03 Hello, in this video I am going to talk about
00:00:08 a tradition, a Catalan tradition,
00:00:11 this is Catalonia and in Catalonia since the
00:00:15 10th and 8th centuries, the 18th century is the
00:00:22 1700s, whatever is done in
00:00:26 Catalonia, a tradition that in 2010 has
00:00:31 been  declared a world heritage
00:00:34 site by unesco so it is very
00:00:38 important many people do not know it i
00:00:41 think in catalonia since the 18th century castles have been
00:00:45 made human castles with
00:00:50 people human castles you want to see
00:00:54 them look look it is like that but this is a
00:00:57 human castle human castles are
00:01:00 they call castells and a castell is a
00:01:03 castle a castle in catalan
00:01:07 in spain they speak spanish but in
00:01:11 catalonia the balearic islands valencia
00:01:14 we also speak catalan and in catalan the
00:01:18 castle is called castells and the people
00:01:21 the people who make the castle are
00:01:24 called castellers the castles are
00:01:27 made by men  and women also men
00:01:31 women and children the pants they wear
00:01:36 are white they wear a
00:01:41 black sash the sash is and is very
00:01:45 important  because they use it to
00:01:49 go up with their hands with their feet and the
00:01:54 shirt is a different color because
00:01:59 there are
00:02:01 Barcelona castellers- in Tarrasa in many places
00:02:05 in Catalonia there are different groups of
00:02:08 castellers and each one wears a
00:02:11 different color red blue green and they don't wear  they don't
00:02:17 wear shoes they go barefoot they don't wear
00:02:20 shoes when a castle is built at the
00:02:24 base
00:02:26 at the base there are many many people and on
00:02:30 top of that they build several floors one floor one
00:02:35 floor one floor of several people and they
00:02:38 make circles they make circles a
00:02:42 circle of people a circle  of
00:02:44 people people hold each other
00:02:49 's arms they hold each other's arms
00:02:55 very tightly
00:02:56 and they climb on top of the shoulders
00:03:02 on the shoulders it's a person
00:03:06 the person and they put their feet here on
00:03:11 top of the shoulders and
00:03:15 little children climb up top up  From all to
00:03:20 the top,
00:03:21 the small children of castles go up, there are
00:03:26 taller, shorter, thicker,
00:03:31 thinner and there is also a type of
00:03:34 castle that is that there is only one person on
00:03:38 top.  of another on top of another this is a
00:03:43 pillar a pillar of one and each castle
00:03:47 depending on whether it is wider thinner
00:03:51 taller shorter has a score they
00:03:55 have more points or less points and the
00:03:59 costs of different sites from barcelona
00:04:02 to tarrasa from various sites
00:04:05 compete  to see who wins to
00:04:08 see who wins first second third
00:04:12 when they make castles people
00:04:22 i fall down they fall down many times
00:04:25 but below as there are people it is soft it
00:04:30 is not hard it is soft but in 2006 there was a
00:04:37 child who died
00:04:42 and when he fell  He hit himself on the head and
00:04:46 died for that reason now the children wear
00:04:51 helmets and they wear a helmet helmet to protect
00:04:55 their heads if seven are a blow, it does
00:04:58 n't hurt them much when they make the human
00:05:02 towers they also play music but they do
00:05:05 n't play the guitar  an instrument is played on
00:05:07 the gray and the timpani are also played to
00:05:11 look to listen to the
00:05:14 music
00:05:16 [Music]

00:05:30 go up to the top and you will not be afraid

00:03:37 dream the same dream continues continues the
00:03:41 same yes yes
00:03:45 for example  once i dreamed i was on a

00:03:56 a path
00:03:59 along a path you can walk and i
00:04:03 was on the path on the path and the
00:04:07 path was floating in the air in the
00:04:12 air in the sky yes i was floating and
00:04:16 this  I had a dream again another day, a
00:04:20 different day, which is a floating road
00:04:24 like the one in Dragon Ball. Do you know
00:04:29 Dragon Ball, there was also a
00:04:32 floating road, but dreams, the dreams
00:04:38 that I like
00:04:41 the most, are lucid dreams.  These are
00:04:46 dreams that when I'm in a dream
00:04:51 when I'm in a dream I know it I know
00:04:56 it's a dream
00:04:59 I know that here in the dream I can do whatever
00:05:04 I want
00:05:06 and I can always always plan

00:05:57 building to a building I go up to a
00:06:03 building and from the building I

00:04:15 very modern way of thinking, very advanced.
00:04:33 they pay for the
00:04:36 food that they pay for everything no no no me
00:04:39 in spain'
00:04:40 I think that many many girls no longer
00:04:46 think like a long time ago they are
00:04:48 more modern and they want
00:04:52 boys and girls to be the same
00:04:56 yes yes yes and what do you think because
00:04:59 I know that in different countries it is very
00:05:04 different it is very different there are countries
00:05:07 like in the usa
00:05:11 the boy has to pay he has to pay
00:05:15 when you go to the restaurant the boy
00:05:18 has to pay not normally
00:05:22 in your country as is the  the boy pays or
00:05:27 the girl also pays or only
00:05:29 only the girl pays to write to
00:05:32 write if only the girl pays I
00:05:35 'll go I'll go to your country okay

274,"00:00:00 this is the coat of arms of Spain and
00:00:06 today I am going to explain where it comes from
00:00:12 where they come from why the
00:00:16 different parts of the different the
00:00:21 different elements of the coat of arms of
00:00:24 Spain
00:00:27 [Music]
00:00:29 ah
00:00:31 hello well yes this this is the  coat of arms of
00:00:37 spain the coat of arms this is a coat of arms of
00:00:41 spain not
00:00:44 of spain and this is the current
00:00:49 coat of arms it is the coat of arms of now
00:00:51 yes
00:00:53 and in this coat of arms we see we see many
00:00:57 things in this coat of arms there is a crown there is
00:01:03 a crown there are two columns
00:01:07 but in this coat of arms  the oldest elements the
00:01:12 oldest parts are
00:01:18 the castle and the lion this is a lion
00:01:23 and this is a castle a castle
00:01:29 and the castle the castle and the lion
00:01:34 were already there were already in a thousand in 1230 on the
00:01:41 shield in 1230 the castle already existed
00:01:46 and the lion but it wasn't it wasn't like that they were 44
00:01:53 parts with the castle the castle is not there
00:01:58 lion lion and castle
00:02:03 were 44 parts then
00:02:09 and these parts
00:02:12 castle and the lion come from two kingdoms
00:02:16 two kingdoms one kingdom is a country a country
00:02:21 where there is a king  not a king or a queen and
00:02:26 these are these are kingdoms for example
00:02:29 these are kingdoms that used
00:02:33 to exist in Spain and this this was a very
00:02:37 large kingdom called Castilla y León
00:02:41 Castilla y León because
00:02:45 previously there were two kingdoms the kingdom
00:02:49 of Castile  and the kingdom of león
00:02:53 that's why the castle and the lion when
00:02:56 this shield came together then this
00:03:00 shield with king with lions with castles
00:03:04 and lions became
00:03:08 the shield of castilla y león'
00:03:13 later in 1492 in 1492 there
00:03:24 were the catholic kings catholic kings
00:03:30 who  Also, the Catholic kings have not been talked about
00:03:33 in other videos in
00:03:36 the history videos you can look at them
00:03:39 and I'm talking about the Catholic kings
00:03:43 and with the Catholic kings
00:03:46 the crown is added the crown
00:03:51 because they are kings is added to the flag
00:03:55 of Aragon  of the kingdom of aragon then
00:03:59 the red kingdom of red color this is the
00:04:04 kingdom of aragon
00:04:07 and the flag not the flag
00:04:11 the flag of aragon
00:04:14 is this with red and
00:04:20 red yellow stripes yellow red  yellow or red
00:04:25 also in 1492 the catholic kings the
00:04:33 catholic kings conquer Granada' they
00:04:36 conquer the caliph the caliphate the
00:04:40 caliphate of Granada then they added
00:04:43 the pomegranate the pomegranate is a fruit the
00:04:48 fruit of the pomegranate and they
00:04:51 put it on the shield also later in
00:04:56 1516
00:04:58 in 1516 they put the columns on the shield
00:05:04 the columns and these columns
00:05:08 that represent
00:05:11 these columns are called columns of
00:05:15 hercules you know hercules hercules
00:05:20 from roman mythology of the romans according to
00:05:25 mythology this
00:05:28 this is the strait of gibraltar here
00:05:32 there is sea that separates the sea  the sea separates
00:05:36 europe from africa no and here there is a
00:05:40 strait a strait and according to the romans
00:05:44 according to roman mythology here there were
00:05:48 columns columns
00:05:51 two columns the columns of hercules
00:05:55 these columns marked the end the
00:05:59 end of the world the end of the world
00:06:03 the planet was ending  it ended here
00:06:07 because it was the end it was the end of the
00:06:11 mediterranean sea the mediterranean sea that was
00:06:15 the one they knew l  he romans the
00:06:18 romans did not know america they did not know
00:06:21 everything around here and then
00:06:24 the columns the columns were a
00:06:27 symbol a symbol that spain had
00:06:30 arrived in america that spain was
00:06:33 conquering america and conquering
00:06:36 many places also in africa
00:06:40 philippines many places  the columns are
00:06:44 a symbol of those conquests of that
00:06:47 expansion of spain and that is why they have the
00:06:53 sea
00:06:54 here you can see the sea not the symbol
00:06:57 of the columns the columns of hercules
00:07:02 and what it says here in the columns puts
00:07:05 plus ultra 'because plus ultra  plus
00:07:08 ultra' is Latin it is a Latin motto because
00:07:12 the Romans the Romans said that
00:07:15 after Gibraltar there was no
00:07:19 land non plus ultra there was nothing
00:07:23 beyond and plus ultra' means that yes
00:07:26 there is beyond there is something
00:07:30 beyond the  strait of gibraltar
00:07:34 in 1520 1520 this is added this
00:07:43 part and this part represents navarre the
00:07:47 kingdom of navarre the kingdom of navarre
00:07:50 because it was conquered by the king the king
00:07:55 conqui  This was also the kingdom of Navarra and
00:07:59 then they also put it on the
00:08:01 shield they put the kingdom of Navarre and in
00:08:05 1700 in 1700 there was a king
00:08:10 a king king felipe quinto felipe
00:08:17 quinto king felipe quinto was from another family
00:08:20 he was not the same family as the
00:08:23 previous kings and king felipe the fifth put
00:08:28 the excursion the excursion is this
00:08:33 part here this part here with the three
00:08:35 flowers are the three flowers represents his
00:08:40 family the family of the bourbons
00:08:44 felipe quinto was from the family of the
00:08:48 bourbons he was a bourbon and the  bourbons
00:08:52 are the same family as the
00:08:55 current kings of spain that the current king
00:08:57 of spain is also a bourbon
00:09:01 so this part is round with the
00:09:05 three flowers represents his family and that's it
00:09:09 i have explained all the parts
00:09:13 all the elements of the coat of
00:09:16 arms  current Spanish but the
00:09:20 current shield is very simple it is very simple
00:09:24 very simple compared to
00:09:27 previous shields previous shields that were
00:09:30 very very complicated
00:09:33 [Music]
00:09:35 and well this  It seems very interesting to
00:09:38 me because I had never noticed it I had never
00:09:43 investigated I had read about the
00:09:46 different parts of the shield where
00:09:49 the shield comes from and you
00:09:52 know where the shield of
00:09:55 your country comes from you know it or not because it is
00:09:58 very interesting

041,"00:00:00 and there is one that is very very very rare hello
00:00:05 today I am going to talk about superstitions of
00:00:10 superstitions that we have here in
00:00:13 Spain yes yes a superstition is
00:00:17 when people don't people people think that
00:00:23 depending on what you do
00:00:25 you will have good luck good luck and
00:00:29 you will have money
00:00:32 you will have health but depending on what you do
00:00:38 you will have bad luck you will have bad luck
00:00:42 you will not have and you will not have money
00:00:48 you will not have money you will not have health you
00:00:51 will not have death yes yes yes
00:00:55 for example in the usa in the usa they think
00:01:07 that fridays fridays is a  the 13th
00:01:12 are bad luck they bring bad luck yes yes yes
00:01:16 yes or for example in china in china they
00:01:21 think that the number 4 the number 4 is
00:01:27 also bad luck it is bad luck well
00:01:32 today I am going to explain the
00:01:35 superstitions of Spain' of Spain in
00:01:41 Spain here  In Spain there are people who believe
00:01:45 that salt is
00:01:48 salt, not salt if it spills and q7 you
00:01:54 spill al z spill salt on the table
00:02:01 on the table if you spill it you have to
00:02:06 catch you have to catch the salt shaker and
00:02:10 throw salt po  r over over the
00:02:15 shoulder like this
00:02:17 yes yes yes yes back to back cheers
00:02:21 yes because if the salt spills if it
00:02:27 spills
00:02:28 you will have bad luck but if you do that
00:02:32 with the salt shaker then no you will not have
00:02:35 bad luck yes yes that strange no the second
00:02:40 superstition  is that a person
00:02:44 if a person sings it sings it if
00:02:50 a person sings badly if it's not good
00:02:53 singing the same as me the same as me
00:02:56 if it's like that then it rains it's going to rain it
00:03:02 rains
00:03:06 yes yes yes yes yes there are people there are people who
00:03:10 think like that  that if you sing and sing badly
00:03:13 it will rain
00:03:15 and there is one that is very very very rare that is
00:03:22 only only for women
00:03:27 only for women for women yes
00:03:31 yes then you know that to
00:03:36 make mayonnaise to make to make
00:03:40 mayonnaise you need egg
00:03:45 egg and  oil
00:03:48 yes yes you have to mix mix egg and
00:03:52 oil but you have to mix it very well
00:03:57 very well because if they don't separate they will
00:04:01 separate yes yes and the egg
00:04:05 egg egg egg and here the oil
00:04:08 oil oil oil remains here  There is
00:04:12 a superstition that women
00:04:18 women who have their period the period
00:04:22 is that
00:04:24 once every month
00:04:27 that women bleed that women
00:04:34 bleed they
00:04:38 bleed in the sink because a woman who
00:04:43 has her period is always going
00:04:47 to cut herself  the mayonnaise the mayonnaise is going to
00:04:51 cut the egg and the oil are going to separate
00:04:55 so a woman with her period

00:01:21 spain in spain ok a house in spain
00:01:26 we are from spain and where where
00:01:30 in spain
00:01:33 We are clear that the
00:01:35 exact place for Spain would be, but it would be
00:01:39 on the coast, the coast in the center,
00:01:42 it would be in the mountains, in the mountains,
00:01:46 where there are mountains in Spain, there are
00:01:49 mountains around here,
00:01:52 there are mountains around here, where there are more mountains around here.
00:01:54 uí
00:01:59 x
00:02:01 vale in the mountain in the mountain
00:02:04 your house would be in the mountain or
00:02:07 near near the mountain and also the
00:02:09 mountain in the mont in the mountain valen
00:02:13 would be in the mountain in the mountain but
00:02:15 we would also like it to be near
00:02:19 the sea near  from the natural sea,
00:02:25 very close to the sea, it's okay, some
00:02:29 options, maybe it would be around here or around
00:02:32 here,
00:02:33 okay,
00:02:35 and what would this house be like?
00:02:51 live
00:02:57 comfortably natives can come
00:03:00 answers family that friends can
00:03:02 come eat eat together they can sleep
00:03:05 have a room for mine it's okay
00:03:10 but not very big because if not to
00:03:13 clean with a lot of work many degrees
00:03:17 your house how many floors would it
00:03:20 have would have 33 floors on the first floor
00:03:25 the the ground floor and the first floor the
00:03:29 second the second which is where the rooms would be
00:03:33 on the first floor on the second floor on
00:03:36 the first floor in e  the first floor here
00:03:38 the rooms and action to sleep
00:03:43 here an attic so it would be it
00:03:46 could even be the roof of my the
00:03:49 moors of the roof okay the roof would be
00:03:52 like this and here I would have that space room
00:03:57 for things for our things to
00:04:00 put them there exactly maybe also
00:04:02 space for  something else to relax
00:04:04 for the rule
00:04:06 it would be a space to be
00:04:10 calmly active to read well to
00:04:13 watch movies it's okay here also a
00:04:16 screen a television or something to watch
00:04:19 to watch movies to store our
00:04:22 things a multitasking space a space
00:04:25 for things for things  that you don't use
00:04:29 and on the ground floor the dining room
00:04:34 the dining room the kitchen
00:04:38 to cook food and such is going very well and
00:04:44 in this house there would be balconies or terraces
00:04:49 there could be a balcony on the first
00:04:52 floor and a patio when leaving the most
00:04:54 part that is  here, well, maybe there would be a
00:04:57 balcony,
00:04:59 but the most important thing is a patio and a
00:05:03 garden, because a patio in a patio, there may
00:05:06 be a table, there may be chairs, no, but  in
00:05:10 a garden there are plants there has a corpse there
00:05:13 may be grass or grass and
00:05:16 you see okay okay there
00:05:19 may be trees and you want
00:05:23 a garden a garden a garden a garden
00:05:26 is a place where food
00:05:31 is grown vegetables are grown
00:05:34 plants are not grown then  there may have been no
00:05:39 gas was added tomatoes onions tomatoes
00:05:47 carrots also bye
00:05:53 [Music]
00:05:57 but not very big this is an orchard
00:06:00 where there are vegetables and a small orchard
00:06:05 in your house
00:06:06 you would have a dog 22 dogs you have everything
00:06:13 all thought out they
00:06:16 are you already know the names
00:06:19 if they  dogs or 200 dogs dogs are worth
00:06:24 recently that I incorporated from the cat
00:06:27 two
00:06:28 strauss dogs but two dogs ellison already sonia
00:06:32 already knows what they are called what
00:06:35 the dogs are called and also two cats
00:06:38 two cats and sonia also knows what
00:06:41 the data is called and also 22  children two
00:06:45 children two children but children not
00:06:48 children still don't know how children are
00:06:57 optional
00:07:00 two dogs and two cats if children
00:07:07 dogs and cats are more important  rtantes
00:07:13 at the moment it is worth
00:07:17 very well and there is something else that is missing in
00:07:21 this house you do not want a slide
00:07:27 and I want that in my house there is a
00:07:32 fireplace a fireplace of course
00:07:36 on the ground floor
00:07:37 here that there is the fireplace no and here that
00:07:41 there is the game  the hearth with a fire
00:07:49 so that it is staggered so that it is
00:07:51 warm
00:07:54 because of course in the mountains it is cold in
00:07:58 winter
00:08:01 in winter it is cold very
00:08:04 very good very good the fireplace that
00:08:08 I do the most the construction of the house for it
00:08:12 would be construction the construction would be
00:08:14 with  materials from the place where natural is
00:08:19 worth things from the area of ​​the area, not
00:08:21 things that are brought from far
00:08:24 away or manufactured, for example,
00:08:27 we would like it to be a stone house, it is
00:08:31 worth eating left of slate from
00:08:35 20 achieved daughter or clearing leaving in  the
00:08:38 place is worth it is made of slate slate
00:08:40 is also a type of stone clothes
00:08:43 worth of place very well I like I really like
00:08:47 your house is also a
00:08:49 very typical house in the Pyrenees for example
00:08:52 there are more  many stone houses loved
00:08:55 a traditional house very well tradition
00:09:01 and something else the interior I did not know how you
00:09:06 would like the interior of the
00:09:08 house to be I would like it to be very bright
00:09:11 to let in a lot of light and a lot of light in
00:09:16 the sunlight not from what  Between a lot,
00:09:20 but it's a little difficult to build a
00:09:23 stone house, but well, the upper part
00:09:29 here between the windows or something
00:09:33 that lets in a lot of light is worth how many
00:09:38 rooms you want, how many you
00:09:42 haven't thought about, we haven't thought about it, but right
00:09:45 now I do.  you asked I would say
00:09:47 that three of you already have one for yourselves
00:09:51 perhaps to work or something for
00:09:53 study
00:09:55 for friends for guests for family
00:10:00 very good very good something more specific to
00:10:04 the interior you already know a
00:10:08 lot of wood
00:10:10 we would like them to have a lot of wood
00:10:11 many things made of wood wood stone
00:10:14 and  wood non-toxic natural things all
00:10:17 natural and very natural material goods
00:10:20 I imagined they are what
00:10:22 this house and I had because we already had with
00:10:26 you  I've talked a little I knew
00:10:29 where I didn't want to live
00:10:33 but I didn't know I already knew the
00:10:35 materials
00:10:38 and yes it's very specific but very good very
00:10:42 good thank you thank you for
00:10:49 [Music]
00:10:52 when you have your dream house and
00:10:56 I'll go to the guest room  The
00:11:00 right room

00:11:04 come and visit us. Thank you very much and

00:00:06 social networks in Spain and

00:00:24 Well yes and the
00:00:30 first one I'm going to talk about is the most
00:00:33 Spanish because it's  a Spanish social network
00:00:36 is called twenty
00:00:41 tuenti
00:00:43 yes and it is a social network that has existed since
00:00:48 2006 in 2006 they opened it and at the beginning it
00:00:55 was more popular in Spain than
00:00:59 facebook yes yes

00:01:16 is similar it is similar to facebook
00:01:20 you can upload photos you can put photos on
00:01:24 your tuenti profile there are also events it
00:01:28 is similar but in 2011 in 2011
00:01:37 facebook facebook surpassed tuenti it
00:01:41 surpassed it and now twenty still
00:01:46 exists twenty you can enter but I
00:01:51 think no one uses it  there are no more people
00:01:55 who use tuenti

00:02:12 no no
00:02:15 and now today  nowadays facebook is the
00:02:19 most important social network the one that most people
00:02:23 use the first is facebook
00:02:31 if a lot of people use it but i
00:02:36 use it less than before especially
00:02:40 for me facebook is an agenda is a
00:02:45 list a list
00:02:50 a list of contacts  a list of my

00:02:58 can communicate the second the second
00:03:03 social network that we use the most that we use the most
00:03:06 here in spain is whatsapp
00:03:11 what's up i think i think almost
00:03:16 everyone almost everyone i know
00:03:19 has whatsapp and whatsapp  It is an
00:03:23 application to send messages to
00:03:27 send messages

00:04:00 in spain  for years no one no one
00:04:05 sends sms anymore yes yes they no longer send sms it is
00:04:10 the third the third most used social network
00:04:14 in spain is youtube youtube
00:04:18 well the same as in the  rest of the world has
00:04:21 been very successful
00:04:23 many people watch it for videos
00:04:29 not for video there is no other website
00:04:33 there are no other websites that are so popular
00:04:37 that so many people watch and I also
00:04:41 watch youtube I watch youtube a lot
00:04:45 too too much yes yes it's been a long
00:04:49 time  looking at youtube
00:04:53 the fourth is twitter
00:04:56 twitter and twitter too many many
00:05:01 people use it but I use it
00:05:07 I have twitter but I don't
00:05:10 quite understand how to use
00:05:13 it I don't know
00:05:14 the fifth the fifth is instagram
00:05:18 instagram
00:05:19 yes yes instagram I think it takes a while  It took
00:05:23 time to come to Spain
00:05:26 for many people in Spain to
00:05:29 use Instagram,
00:05:31 but now many people have it, they
00:05:34 have Instagram and then there is
00:05:38 another social network that
00:05:41 is very popular in other places abroad, many
00:05:45 people use it  but in spain not in spain I
00:05:50 don't know people who use it and it's snap chat
00:05:58 snapshot I don't know what position it is in it's not
00:06:02 very high because few people use it
00:06:05 in spain in spain it's used m  very little and
00:06:11 I used snap chat once I put it I
00:06:15 put it on the phone and the obs but I didn't
00:06:20 like it very much I didn't like it very much no I did
00:06:25 n't understand it I didn't understand I didn't find it
00:06:28 interesting no I didn't find it
00:06:31 interesting
00:06:33 and these are the networks  social
00:06:37 networks that we use in Spain and that I believe that in
00:06:41 many countries, in many countries,
00:06:44 basically the same ones are used, not the only
00:06:48 exception was twenty twenty, which
00:06:51 was used a lot in the past, and in
00:06:56 your country there is another social network,
00:06:59 some social network that you use  that is not
00:07:02 used here decide to say it write it
00:07:06 below in the comments

084,"00:00:00 so so so so
00:00:04 hello today I am going to talk about 5 things 1 2 3 4
00:00:11 5 5 things that only happen in Spain
00:00:18 well I think they only happen in
00:00:22 Spain the first is the butanero
00:00:28 the butanero but to explain the
00:00:32 butanero first we are going to talk about
00:00:37 cooking  the kitchen is the place of the house
00:00:41 the house there is a piece of furniture that is used to
00:00:45 cook to cook food the kitchen is used
00:00:49 the kitchen has an oven this is
00:00:55 the oven the oven
00:00:57 and the stove no stove stove the
00:01:03 stove is used with a frying pan a  pot
00:01:09 and put the stove on stove on stove with
00:01:14 fire no fire
00:01:20 then stoves there are electric stoves
00:01:27 that work with electricity yes yes yes
00:01:32 electric not something like that electric but
00:01:36 there are also gas fire fire fire
00:01:40 fire
00:01:42 and that work with gas gas
00:01:45 but most of  the houses have
00:01:49 pipes they have pipes that go to the
00:01:53 kitchen
00:01:55 and here goes the gas gas gas
00:02:00 gas and my house my house does not have it does not have
00:02:05 gas it does not have gas it has electricity yes yes
00:02:09 yes but there are houses there are houses mine does not
00:02:13 but other other houses do not have an
00:02:17 electric stove no no no but they do not have
00:02:21 pipes no no they do not have a
00:02:26 gas stove and they do not have pipes and then what
00:02:30 do they do because they use a bottle the
00:02:36 thin bottle is stored here is the kitchen
00:02:41 with the oven and al  On one side there is another piece
00:02:45 of furniture with a door
00:02:49 and inside there is a cylinder inside there the
00:02:54 cylinder then from the cylinder you put
00:02:58 a pipe
00:03:01 into the kitchen and then you can use it with
00:03:04 gas you can cook food yes yes yes
00:03:09 then this is the cylinder and the gas
00:03:12 tanker is a  person a person and
00:03:17 I think the majority are men men
00:03:23 because you have to be strong to
00:03:26 lift the cylinder and in the cylinder the
00:03:30 gas the gas that is inside the gas
00:03:34 is butane gas butane gas
00:03:38 that is why the person is called a butanero
00:03:43 and the butanero walks  down the street he
00:03:47 goes down the street with a canister a canister
00:03:52 was screaming screaming butane is not there
00:03:57 we are
00:03:59 ah
00:04:01 [Music]
00:04:04 yes yes yes and banging with the canister
00:04:08 for a pam pam pam pam a lot of
00:04:13 noise
00:04:14 then the canister  when
00:04:18 the gas runs out the gas runs out you yell at the
00:04:23 butanero [ __ ] but he goes up and the butanero
00:04:29 goes up the stairs the butanero goes
00:04:34 up goes up the stairs with the bottle
00:04:38 and you pay him you give him money you give him money and he
00:04:43 gives you a bottle the bottle with gas  He
00:04:48 gives it to you with gas
00:04:50 and you return this bottle that no longer
00:04:54 has gas and if you exchange them, that
00:04:59 's it,
00:04:59 this is the first thing that
00:05:02 is only in Spain, which seems to be a
00:05:06 bit strange, no, the butane tanker goes so so
00:05:09 so so
00:05:24 then  the carboy
00:05:28 the carboy when it's over

00:04:50 other drawings other drawings that I
00:04:53 also saw a lot are the three
00:04:58 twins the three twins are three
00:05:02 girls
00:05:03 three girls three girls who are the same
00:05:08 because they are twins no the three girls

00:06:24 when the story ends when the
00:06:26 story ends then if they can go out
00:06:30 but the story has to end well if

00:07:21 but the animation the drawings were
00:07:25 made in japan  they were made in japan or

226,"00:00:00 hello hello today my friend Ricardo is here
00:00:05 again
00:00:08 and today we are going to talk about things that do not matter to us
00:00:15 because in life there are important
00:00:20 things important things not for example what
00:00:26 things are important
00:00:28 [Music]
00:00:33 what things are important and work
00:00:37 the  work have a job that gives you
00:00:40 money not that gives you money so you
00:00:44 can eat of course and then
00:00:47 food food is important drive
00:00:50 love love is important but there are things that
00:00:56 are not important there are things that are not
00:01:00 important things that give us  The same
00:01:04 things that we don't care about, for example, what
00:01:08 things there are, well,
00:01:11 things that we don't care about, these are more
00:01:14 difficult to think about, complicated,
00:01:17 for example, you think that
00:01:21 what they see on
00:01:27 TV is important and what is on TV is important,
00:01:31 there aren't many  I don't care about things on TV, I
00:01:35 also don't care, I don't care who
00:01:37 there is, who is on TV one day, it's not, it
00:01:41 's not important, it doesn't give us equality,
00:01:45 what else do you think is
00:01:50 important, fame is important?  That
00:01:53 many people that many many
00:01:57 people know who Ricardo is is
00:02:02 important or not, I really don't think it
00:02:07 's very important to have good friends,
00:02:12 okay, it's important that your friends are
00:02:15 good friends that help you, they're animals,
00:02:18 and that you can talk to them, so
00:02:22 be famous.  If many people know
00:02:26 you, it doesn't matter to you if it doesn't matter to you, I
00:02:29 also don't care, I want to
00:02:33 help help people, but I
00:02:36 don't care if many, many people know me, no, if this is the case, is
00:02:40 there something you want to ask
00:02:42 me?  you don't care about
00:02:44 the economy the economy the economy bad economy the economy
00:02:49 can go badly the economy
00:02:56 I don't care I don't think it's important
00:03:00 because there are many people who need
00:03:05 the economy to go well to
00:03:10 have a job to have work to
00:03:13 do and  Being able to eat
00:03:16 and you Ricardo think that being rich having a
00:03:23 lot of money
00:03:25 is important or it doesn't matter to you it
00:03:29 's important it's important it's something
00:03:32 important that Ricardo
00:03:35 doesn't care about  It doesn't matter if you don't have a
00:03:38 lot of money, you think it's better to have a
00:03:40 lot of money and that not having a lot of money
00:03:44 isn't exactly fine,
00:03:46 and what else is there to have a
00:03:49 great car and a car than to have a
00:03:54 batman batman car
00:03:58 hehe
00:04:00 have a car
00:04:05 [Laughs]
00:04:10 to a car that costs a lot of money an
00:04:13 expensive car
00:04:15 having a car that costs a lot of money
00:04:19 is not important to me it doesn't matter to me
00:04:24 having a cargo car because for
00:04:28 me a car is a tool it's a
00:04:33 tool yes I think a car is a
00:04:37 car  expensive it's nice and i think maybe
00:04:42 once in my life once maybe i rent
00:04:46 not a lazy a little bit of money so i can
00:04:49 drive an expensive car an expensive car and
00:04:53 notice notice the feeling of i don't think it
00:04:57 's it's fun but i think it's not
00:05:02 important  I don't care about having a
00:05:04 cargo car and you don't care or you do
00:05:11 n't care about it I don't care about it I don't care about you
00:05:13 prefer to have a good car and a
00:05:16 good car an expensive car and a Mercedes
00:05:19 for example if it installs very
00:05:23 well  more than more things there are for you  it is
00:05:27 important to live near the beach
00:05:31 near the beach not the beach in barcelona there is a
00:05:35 beach there the sea there are palm trees on the
00:05:40 beach in barcelona the palm trees there are
00:05:44 palm trees you cannot sunbathe you
00:05:47 can swim at the beach
00:05:50 for me it is no no  It's very important but
00:05:56 I don't care I don't care it's better for me to
00:06:00 live near the beach I
00:06:03 like it I like I like the sea I like
00:06:08 the beach I prefer to live near the
00:06:11 beach and you
00:06:14 don't care no I don't care  the same now he already loves the
00:06:18 sea he loves it he likes it very
00:06:22 much very much very well I love it
00:06:25 for you it is important to live near the
00:06:28 sea do you think you could it would be
00:06:31 possible for you to live far away from the
00:06:34 sea and I think so but it would be difficult

219,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you again about love of
00:00:06 love
00:00:08 yes and I am going to talk about five things
00:00:14 five things that when a girl when
00:00:18 a girl when a girl
00:00:22 does them I don't like when a girl does these
00:00:27 five things
00:00:30 I don't like
00:00:34 and if before  I liked I liked the
00:00:38 girl no longer I don't like her anymore I don't want
00:00:43 you to tell me if you care about the
00:00:46 same things if you care about the same
00:00:50 five things or you don't care about
00:00:54 different things other things
00:00:57 [Music]
00:01:04 hello well
00:01:05 the first thing the first  What
00:01:10 I don't like is when a girl
00:01:15 is unfriendly and treats the
00:01:21 service badly, treats the waiters badly, for
00:01:26 example, a waitress comes, a waitress
00:01:30 who brings food, brings drinks, doesn't bring a
00:01:35 plate of food, brings drinks, and
00:01:40 a girl treats her badly  He speaks
00:01:44 badly to him what does he say because you take
00:01:48 so long what do you speak badly to him if the
00:01:52 girl speaks badly to the waiter or the waitress
00:01:56 I don't like it I don't I don't like the girl
00:02:02 the girl thinks she's a princess she
00:02:06 's a princess
00:02:09 yes yes s  Yes, but no, she's not a princess and
00:02:13 I don't like girls to think they
00:02:16 're a princess. The second thing,
00:02:20 the second thing, is when I and a
00:02:25 girl are with friends, we're with more
00:02:29 friends, friends, and the girl
00:02:35 speaks badly to me.  me or the girl speaks badly to the
00:02:39 boyfriend to the boyfriend they are not boyfriends they
00:02:43 are boyfriends and the girl talks badly to the boyfriend
00:02:48 criticizes him he says that you do it
00:02:53 wrong that you do it wrong or when he
00:02:57 embarrasses him when hahahaha he laughs ha ha
00:03:01 ha ha ha he laughs  the boyfriend and there are more
00:03:05 people there are friends in front is something
00:03:08 I don't like I don't like when a girl
00:03:12 doesn't do it
00:03:14 the third the third thing the third
00:03:18 thing is a girl
00:03:22 a girl who thinks everything thinks
00:03:27 everything negatively
00:03:31 everything  Think badly in a negative way, for
00:03:36 example,
00:03:37 if he sends you a message, he sends you a
00:03:41 message and you don't read it, you don't read it until
00:03:45 later, you don't answer, you don't answer
00:03:50 until later, after a while, he gets
00:03:54 angry, gets angry and tells you why,
00:03:58 why not  you answer me quickly you have to
00:04:01 answer  take the messages
00:04:05 quickly that you're with another girl really you
00:04:10 're with another another girl another girl that's
00:04:14 not me right right that's why you don't
00:04:16 answer the messages the calls
00:04:20 right
00:04:22 this I don't like this I don't like
00:04:27 the fourth thing
00:04:29 the fourth thing  They are boring
00:04:38 boring girls who are not funny for
00:04:43 example I once went to the beach
00:04:48 I went to the beach with a girl with a
00:04:53 girl but the girl didn't swim she didn't swim in
00:04:58 the sea she didn't sunbathe she didn't sunbathe
00:05:05 to get a tan no no she was not taking
00:05:10 pictures all the time taking
00:05:14 pictures taking selfish
00:05:18 all the time
00:05:21 all the time taking is the fish that
00:05:25 's very boring
00:05:27 I don't know I like to swim I like to do
00:05:32 things not just take pictures and this
00:05:36 girl was very  boring and I don't like
00:05:39 that no no I don't like it and the fifth thing the
00:05:45 fifth thing I don't like is that a
00:05:48 girl
00:05:50 smokes that she smokes when a girl smokes
00:05:59 her mouth smells like this what a
00:06:04 stink what a stink I don't like the smell  of
00:06:10 tobacco  when I kiss a girl
00:06:15 her mouth tastes like an ashtray like an
00:06:20 ashtray not the same as an ashtray with
00:06:26 half ash to ash ash and
00:06:30 no no I don't like it and what things do you not
00:06:35 like in a girl or a boy

217,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about Machu Picchu of
00:00:05 Machu Picchu and why the
00:00:09 most important ruins are the most important of
00:00:15 the Incas
00:00:17 [Music]
00:00:23 Good, I think that all of
00:00:28 you know it. Machu
00:00:32 Picchu Machu Picchu is very famous, it is very
00:00:36 well known and  it's in the south of peru in the
00:00:43 south of peru here
00:00:48 in peru
00:00:50 and it's in the andes' the andes are
00:00:54 mountains
00:00:57 a cordillera a
00:01:01 very long very long mountain range that goes
00:01:04 all the way across south america so it's very long and
00:01:11 machu picchu was built  it was
00:01:15 built by the incas the incas who
00:01:20 lived in south america lived in
00:01:23 south america they built machu picchu in
00:01:29 the mountains they built it at 2,000
00:01:35 four hundred and thirty meters of altitude
00:01:40 at 2,430 yes and it was a residence a place
00:01:49 where there was the house of the emperor the
00:01:55 emperor was like the king  more or less the
00:01:59 king of the Incas had a house here he
00:02:03 had a vacation home to go to
00:02:09 rest and they lived here but before
00:02:17 before he was the emperor it seems that he was
00:02:21 to a religious site a place where one
00:02:25 would pray was not very important
00:02:30 for religion
00:02:32 and it seems that later the king also put
00:02:37 his house there
00:02:39 and they lived in machu picchu there were about 700
00:02:46 people living 700 people yes there were monks
00:02:53 there were monks
00:02:57 but there were also peasants people  who
00:03:01 farmed farmed the land to make
00:03:05 food and machu picchu was built in
00:03:11 the 15th century the 15th century
00:03:16 is the 1400s whatever it was when
00:03:23 machu picchu was built but then
00:03:26 in the 16th century in the 16th century there are 10
00:03:36 16
00:03:38 they left all the  The world left Machu
00:03:42 Picchu no, it is not known why but
00:03:47 surely it is surely because
00:03:50 the
00:03:55 conquistadors came the conquistadors came to other places
00:03:57 other places where there were Incas Incas
00:04:02 the conquistadors came and
00:04:06 they had to leave and in Machu
00:04:09 Picchu there are 150 buildings  150 buildings
00:04:17 between houses and temples there are 150 and they are
00:04:23 very well made buildings they were made
00:04:28 very well very strong because in this area
00:04:32 there are earthquakes
00:04:36 yes yes  but the buildings did not fall
00:04:41 because they were very well made also
00:04:44 in machu picchu there are terraces terraces
00:04:50 terraces in the mountains there are terraces to
00:04:53 cultivate
00:04:55 to cultivate plants to cultivate
00:04:59 food no but they had a problem and
00:05:04 that is that in machu picchu it rains and it rains a
00:05:07 lot there is rain
00:05:11 there  a lot of rain, that's why here on
00:05:16 earth they had to put stones,
00:05:21 stones,
00:05:23 then sand, sand,
00:05:27 and then earth, earth, they did
00:05:32 several layers and so when it rained, the water
00:05:37 would go away,
00:05:40 the water would go away very quickly
00:05:43 so that it wouldn't flood so that it wouldn't
00:05:46 there were floods
00:05:49 and they
00:05:51 were the Incas were very clever
00:05:55 and the reason why Machu
00:06:00 Picchu is the site are the ruins
00:06:03 the most important remains of the Incas
00:06:08 is that the Spanish the conquistadors
00:06:13 never found it they never
00:06:17 discovered it they never saw Machu Picchu
00:06:21 no  not because the conquerors the
00:06:25 conquerors liked to steal they
00:06:28 liked to loot take everything they
00:06:32 found and that's why if there is a  One thing
00:06:35 you have to know about the Spanish of
00:06:39 the conquistadors is that they behaved
00:06:42 very badly throughout the history
00:06:46 of Latin America- the conquistadors
00:06:51 are always the bad guys
00:06:55 and that is why because the Spanish never
00:06:58 found it, it was not known that Machu Picchu
00:07:02 It existed until 1911 in 1911 it was when the
00:07:10 whole world knew that Machu Picchu
00:07:14 existed and they found
00:07:18 many things were found ceramics were
00:07:23 found mummies were found jewelry
00:07:28 and statues were also found
00:07:32 and you have been to Machu Picchu
00:07:35 you have been to Machu Picchu
00:07:38 I have never never been to Machu Picchu
00:07:40 yet have not yet been to Machu Picchu
00:07:44 but I would like to I want to go I want to go to

00:00:34 expensive things and cheap things
00:00:38 here we are we are going to talk about things
00:00:41 we are going to talk about what things are expensive and
00:00:46 cheap in spain
00:00:50 a nacho you would say that the rent to pay
00:00:57 for a house
00:00:59 for a house
00:01:01 a house or a flat not to live in a
00:01:05 house or a flat you have to pay
00:01:09 every month
00:01:12 you live in an apartment I live in this apartment in
00:01:15 the east and I pay much less money to
00:01:21 live in Barcelona than to live in
00:01:25 Boston, it's okay because you used to live in
00:01:29 Boston I used to live in Boston in
00:01:32 Boston in the United States in the USA and I
00:01:35 paid  double double paid double the
00:01:40 money double the money for
00:01:42 renting the apartment
00:01:43 that's worth samples so you would say that
00:01:48 here in barcelona it's cheap it's
00:01:51 cheaper it's cheap but what they pay you the
00:01:55 salary is also lower not every cad
00:01:59 per month each month the money you receive for
00:02:02 working is also fewer
00:02:05 people who pay less and you pay less
00:02:09 rent and rent you also pay less of
00:02:11 course but barcelona barcelona if we
00:02:16 compare it with other places in spain it is
00:02:19 more expensive it is expensive it is not very expensive you pay a
00:02:22 lot  a lot of money for rent but
00:02:25 boston is much more expensive boston even
00:02:28 more even more expensive ok it is
00:02:30 very expensive very expensive very expensive very expensive
00:02:36 supergard super k the other thing apart
00:02:40 from rent one thing we
00:02:42 spend money on is in the supermarket to
00:02:46 have food  to do the shopping go
00:02:49 to the supermarket no and the supermarket would
00:02:53 you say that here in barcelona or here
00:02:56 in spain it is expensive or it is cheap the supermarket
00:03:01 in spain is much cheaper than in the
00:03:04 usa it is cheaper it costs less less
00:03:08 money less money  that in the usa
00:03:12 it costs me half to buy
00:03:15 half, well, it's double for rent,
00:03:18 yes, and now I'm going to buy the rooms
00:03:23 and it doesn't matter, it's not the same, the rent is
00:03:27 double to do the c  Buy in the supermarket
00:03:30 also in double it's also the
00:03:31 double it's okay well if you come here it's
00:03:35 much cheaper if it costs less less
00:03:37 money it costs little money very well and I
00:03:41 have lived in Japan and in Japan it also
00:03:46 costs more money the supermarket the
00:03:49 fruit the fruit  the fruit the fruit not the
00:03:54 oranges the apples cost a lot of
00:03:56 money and the vegetables the vegetables also
00:04:00 the tomatoes the peppers tomatoes
00:04:04 peppers also cost more money I
00:04:08 in Japan
00:04:09 I saw a watermelon a watermelon
00:04:13 a watermelon for 35 dollars 35 dollars 35
00:04:20 dollars a watermelon a watermelon we are
00:04:22 crazy oysters and here in spain how much
00:04:25 money would a watermelon cost
00:04:28 12 hours 2 euros 2 euros a kilo it takes away
00:04:32 maybe sometimes a watermelon like
00:04:35 88 euros or something
00:04:37 sweet can be much much less money
00:04:40 than japan yes yes japan was expensive but
00:04:44 the  rent
00:04:48 and a flat or a house in japan it is not more
00:04:51 expensive than in spain it is not very expensive no no
00:04:55 me for a room in an apartment for
00:05:01 a room I spoke less I paid
00:05:05 less in japan qu  And now that now in
00:05:09 Spain
00:05:11 there is something else that is also
00:05:14 cheaper, it costs less less money in
00:05:17 Japan, which is eating out, eating at a
00:05:21 restaurant, going to a restaurant to eat
00:05:23 costs less money, what do you think that in
00:05:26 Spain it is expensive or cheap to eat?  outside
00:05:30 the restaurant in spain' eating in a
00:05:32 restaurant is cheap it is
00:05:35 cheap cheaper it is cheap it is cheaper than in
00:05:38 other european countries it is cheaper than
00:05:41 in other european countries it
00:05:42 is true in france germany england it
00:05:46 costs more money to go to a restaurant it is
00:05:50 true yes yes
00:05:52 but my impression is that it
00:05:55 is still expensive yes in japan it was very
00:05:59 cheap and in thailand it was very very cheap it
00:06:03 is cheaper than going to
00:06:07 the supermarket it is less money than going to the
00:06:10 supermarket and buying food and cooking
00:06:13 cooking you  same yes yes but spain is
00:06:18 still cheap compared to the usa usa
00:06:22 also being the restaurant it is also
00:06:24 expensive without a doubt and you also have to
00:06:29 tip
00:06:31 at least 15% not 15 at least  20
00:06:34 percent more than you have to add
00:06:38 to the thrombin price, the normal is 20
00:06:41 20 percent is normal, it is at
00:06:44 least because there is one thing I want to
00:06:47 ask you if it is expensive or cheap and it is the
00:06:50 cost of the health of the  hospitals
00:06:55 from the hospital and from the medicines the
00:06:59 pills of
00:07:00 course he
00:07:06 is sick they are taking me and they
00:07:09 put him in the hospital and he dies but
00:07:14 I hope not
00:07:18 the hospitals here are expensive or they are
00:07:22 cheap they are cheap because they are public they
00:07:25 are public not all are public
00:07:30 but healthcare  Who pays is the government, it's
00:07:33 public, so to go to a hospital
00:07:37 to be cured doesn't cost money, it
00:07:41 's free, we don't pay, we pay with
00:07:43 taxes,
00:07:46 but if you're sick or have cancer or
00:07:50 whatever, you don't have to spend a lot of
00:07:52 money on medicines, pills, you do
00:07:57 n't  pills
00:08:01 so you have to pay but you don't have to
00:08:04 pay one hundred percent you don't have to pay
00:08:06 everything very well the pill a
00:08:09 great pill for moles on the head
00:08:11 for when your head hurts the
00:08:17 pills  illas we don't have to pay one
00:08:19 hundred percent no it's not necessary to pay one
00:08:22 hundred percent we pay less right so if it's
00:08:26 cheap it's quite cheap especially if you
00:08:29 compare with the US
00:08:32 in these two measures it's much more expensive and
00:08:35 the difference is very expensive
00:08:37 they give you  a trolley
00:08:41 with the exact number of pills and they do
00:08:46 n't give you a box in spain they give you a
00:08:50 box
00:08:52 with a lot of pills
00:08:55 many pills in the united states they
00:08:57 give you seven pills that's it 7 pills
00:09:00 50 dollars 50 is a lot a lot of money and the
00:09:06 hospital costs too  a lot a lot of
00:09:08 money of course in my experience in
00:09:12 japan healthcare in japan does not cost a lot a
00:09:15 lot of money
00:09:17 so you have to pay you have to pay
00:09:20 30% you have to pay it but there is a
00:09:24 limit in a month in a month if you arrive
00:09:29 if you pay a lot of money that's it  you have
00:09:32 to pay more you don't have to pay more
00:09:34 than a limit no and there's one
00:09:39 more thing I want to ask you
00:09:42 and it's the price the price of a ticket
00:09:46 a movie ticket to go see a
00:09:50 movie
00:09:51 a movie when it goes  Go to the movies to see a
00:09:55 movie, it's expensive or cheap, it depends,
00:10:02 it's not normally there. It's 13 dollars for
00:10:06 this in Boston. I like them in Boston in the
00:10:09 United States, 13 dollars, but if
00:10:13 you want to see it in 3D, it's worth three more ways,
00:10:16 even more, and if you want to buy
00:10:19 popcorn  The popcorn is more expensive of
00:10:23 course it costs money they need a lot a
00:10:25 lot of money the popcorn is very expensive it
00:10:29 is very very expensive very good popcorn is
00:10:32 great popcorn is very expensive they
00:10:37 should put a dollar dollar many many
00:10:39 dollars are very expensive here in Spain
00:10:44 going to the movies costs about  88 euros eight
00:10:49 euros or less or less 77 euros
00:10:53 but there is one day a day of the week it
00:10:58 depends on the location of the city, for
00:11:01 example Wednesday that costs less
00:11:04 costs about four four or five euros it
00:11:08 is cheaper it is cheaper because it is the
00:11:12 day of  spectator if it is called the day
00:11:15 of the spectator the day the spectator is
00:11:18 the person like us who goes to see
00:11:21 a movie
00:11:23 I don't know why it is called the day of the
00:11:25 spectator it is a
00:11:28 marketing strategy  ng is marketing they are very very
00:11:30 smart
00:11:32 in japan the cinema was also more expensive yes
00:11:36 yes also a price similar to that of the
00:11:38 united states it costs more money
00:11:42 and in thailand there were
00:11:46 about 300,300 watts
00:11:52 which would be more or less between seven and eight
00:11:55 euros a similar price  to the one here
00:11:57 where Spain
00:11:59 was not very very expensive and very cheap it is
00:12:03 well priced it was well well behind
00:12:05 well priced well

243,"00:00:00 you know why because the clouds
00:00:08 because the clouds don't don't fall
00:00:13 watch this video and you'll know why
00:00:18 why they don't fall
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:25 hello
00:00:27 you know why because
00:00:31 the clouds float because the clouds are water they are
00:00:38 water they
00:00:40 are drops
00:00:42 drops of water  but they are very small drops of water
00:00:47 very small but the water the
00:00:52 water weighs the water weighs yes yes it is not
00:00:56 lighter than the air
00:00:59 no no the balloons the balloons with helium
00:01:05 the balloons with helium are lighter than
00:01:08 the air
00:01:09 that's why they float  but the clouds are not the
00:01:14 clouds are water they are heavy
00:01:20 but the reason why the
00:01:24 clouds float
00:01:27 is really the clouds don't float us the
00:01:32 clouds are falling they are really
00:01:36 falling little by little little by little but they are
00:01:40 falling yes yes yes for  For example, do
00:01:44 you know, do you know what dust is,
00:01:49 dust, dust also weighs more
00:01:55 than air, but it is very
00:01:59 small, it is very small, that is why it does not fall or
00:02:03 does not fall very quickly, no, it does not fall, it falls, but
00:02:08 little by little, little by little.
00:02:10 little by little it falls and then the clouds  it is the same the
00:02:14 same because the drops the drops of water
00:02:18 are very small they are very small with what
00:02:22 they fall they fall very little by little
00:02:27 what happens is that the air
00:02:30 the air the air around the clouds
00:02:34 is hot yes yes for example in
00:02:40 the sea
00:02:43 in the sea
00:02:45 when the sun shines
00:02:48 when the sun
00:02:52 shines the water evaporates the water the
00:02:56 sea water evaporates evaporates and as
00:03:02 the sun shines as the sun shines here the air
00:03:08 rises
00:03:10 the air rises and pushes pushes the
00:03:15 clouds pushes them  up
00:03:19 that's why the clouds are very high because
00:03:23 there is air there is air hot air and it is
00:03:29 raising them but if for some reason the
00:03:34 cloud squeezes the droplets
00:03:41 the drops the droplets gather
00:03:46 together in drops in
00:03:49 larger drops then they are not so small
00:03:54 they are not small like dust they are
00:03:57 bigger and they fall they fall and we have rain
00:04:05 yes yes yes and this this is the reason
00:04:10 why the clouds do not fall
00:04:14 is that they are falling they are falling but
00:04:17 little by little little by little and the air the
00:04:22 hot air  pushes them pushes them to
00:04:26 ar  Riba
00:04:27 and you there is

00:05:39 is the way to say hello with your friends
00:05:43 with your friends you say hello you can say
00:05:48 hello hello how are you
00:05:50 but also
00:05:53 if it is, for example, a girl

00:06:48 no they don't shake hands hello how are you
00:06:51 yes yes yes
00:06:53 remember this is polite
00:06:59 the sixth the sixth
00:07:03 is something
00:07:06 that is
00:07:08 rude it's rude
00:07:12 and it has to do with the gesture this
00:07:17 this gesture in spain is a bit similar
00:07:24 to giving the middle finger yes yes yes it's
00:07:29 similar it's an insult it's very bad no do
00:07:32 n't do it
00:07:34 and it has more meaning when you're
00:07:38 doing  a photo for example a photo
00:07:41 you take a photo with your friend not your friend
00:07:45 or your friend and you do it like this from behind
00:07:50 horns horns it's like a cow doesn't
00:07:56 have horns
00:07:59 so horns the same if you make horns to your friend
00:08:07 horns it
00:08:09 's fun hahahaha but  It also
00:08:14 means that your friend or your friend, her
00:08:18 boyfriend or girlfriend,
00:08:21 her boyfriend or girlfriend cheats on
00:08:24 him, it means that he
00:08:28 has another boyfriend or girlfriend.
00:08:38 like a yes yes yes yes

00:08:45 bad meaning to be careful

00:01:18 Antarctica, but today we are not going to talk
00:01:22 about Antarctica, we are not going to talk about Peru,
00:01:25 Peru, Peru, and a trip, a specific trip,
00:01:29 but specifically in Peru, Peru,
00:01:33 which is in Latin America and they do not speak
00:01:36 Spanish. Spanish  the same as us and it's going
00:01:39 to that in Spain the same as in Spain and in
00:01:42 Peru what did you do? In Peru we took a
00:01:48 boat trip on the Amazon River.
00:02:02 brazil e  The
00:02:07 amazon is in the amazon it is a river a
00:02:13 very long river between a very very long with a
00:02:15 lot of water okay and you were in
00:02:19 the amazon with a boat we were not in the
00:02:22 ucayali river which is one the mind is
00:02:28 worth ucayali I think you have
00:02:32 said before that the  ucayali joins not the
00:02:35 amazon ucayali another other river joins
00:02:39 exactly it is worth the ucayali river and the marañón river
00:02:42 sea value when they come together they
00:02:45 form what the amazon river is worth
00:02:49 ucayali and marañón join together and
00:02:53 form the amazon exactly it is worth and in
00:02:58 this  this trip not here here is the sea
00:03:01 here is the sea and the water the water is
00:03:05 going there
00:03:07 and you with a boat went
00:03:10 downwards or upwards upwards upwards
00:03:13 up against the countercurrent on the
00:03:16 way and against the current
00:03:18 of the water it is exactly the  water I
00:03:20 phraya and you in the direction in the
00:03:23 opposite direction to which the
00:03:25 opposite water flows okay and why because
00:03:29 this trip was interesting it
00:03:32 was very interesting because we were
00:03:35 seven days inside the bar  co
00:03:40 sleeping and living on top of a
00:03:45 hammock is worth 7 days a week
00:03:48 a week a whole week on the boat totally
00:03:51 worth sleeping sleeping on sunday on the
00:03:55 boat always on the boat always inside
00:03:58 the gas no you didn't go out it's a flower and but
00:04:01 on the boat that's not  you had a bed no here
00:04:05 there was no bed the bed bed to sleep
00:04:08 no there was no more to sleep there were no
00:04:11 rooms or rooms there was no
00:04:15 where else where to sleep ice in a
00:04:18 hammock a hammock the hammocks let's see
00:04:23 I can draw a tree for example don't
00:04:27 come in  you can have trees
00:04:31 it is not hanging and you can sleep you can
00:04:35 sleep here in the hammock and samacá
00:04:38 we slept and spent all day
00:04:41 all day not from morning until night
00:04:45 all day in the hammock yes and
00:04:49 you each had a hammock each
00:04:52 a mass completely and in the hammock you
00:04:55 sleep you sleep well
00:04:57 at the beginning it is difficult it
00:05:01 is difficult to sleep at the beginning it
00:05:04 is difficult to sleep it is difficult to
00:05:07 sleep but with the passage of time I
00:05:10 find  as the comfortable posture and now you can
00:05:13 sleep comfortably okay okay is the
00:05:17 posture the posture position is
00:05:19 important and very important tests
00:05:22 tests various various postures various
00:05:25 positions until from there you find
00:05:28 a good one and then if you can sleep
00:05:30 exactly very well and the trip this was
00:05:36 interesting because there were many days not
00:05:39 a week and I slept in a hammock
00:05:43 and something else happened there was something more
00:05:45 interesting on the ship as the
00:05:49 ship progressed on its journey
00:05:53 many people from the different
00:05:57 villages along the journey got on  the
00:06:01 boat is okay, that is, the boat was going here
00:06:03 advancing and it stopped in a village a
00:06:07 town a town with houses houses houses
00:06:10 houses here it would stop and the people people from the
00:06:15 town would get on the boat with their hammocks
00:06:19 with also with hammocks anything goes with
00:06:22 america and then  the boat to the
00:06:25 next town the next village no
00:06:28 ex águila again and so puig several
00:06:32 times no

00:00:23 Spain is very good there are many things
00:00:27 that I do like but today
00:00:31 I'm going  Let's talk about things that I don't
00:00:35 like, okay, the first thing
00:00:39 is the trains,
00:00:42 the trains,
00:00:47 not
00:00:49 the trains in Spain, the trains are
00:00:53 fine, but they are often late, yes,

00:01:33 trains are often late yes yes yes it is  something
00:01:37 that I don't like
00:01:42 and this is the trains is the first
00:01:46 thing the first thing yes yes the second thing
00:01:51 is that there are people there are people
00:01:56 there are people who are very
00:01:59 dirty dirty but no not because they are
00:02:03 dirty no no no because they take garbage
00:02:08 garbage the  they throw it on

00:02:35 it no no I don't like
00:02:38 that I don't like it then the third thing
00:02:42 the third thing I don't like is  that
00:02:48 many times on Saturdays and Sundays
00:02:52 especially on Sunday there are many stores
00:02:57 stores
00:02:59 stores such as supermarkets
00:03:03 that close they are closed on Saturday and
00:03:06 Sunday you cannot go shopping in the
00:03:09 store yes yes yes and on Sundays

00:03:17 of the  shops are closed
00:03:21 supermarkets are
00:03:22 closed restaurants restaurants
00:03:26 are open but supermarkets are not and
00:03:29 I don't like that

00:03:44 that is not it is not good it is  something from I don't

00:03:52 cruel it's cruel to the animals I

00:04:01 bulls are not something it's not something good
00:04:05 and the fifth the fifth and ú  Last thing the
00:04:09 fifth thing is poverty since 2007

",2
275,"00:00:00 and this is spain
00:00:04 spain because it is called españa because the
00:00:11 name of spain is spain in this video
00:00:16 I am going to explain it to you
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:22 ah
00:00:24 hello well
00:00:25 yes today as you will see this video is a
00:00:33 little different I am drawing drawing
00:00:39 with the computer
00:00:42 I am drawing with my  computer
00:00:48 yes to make it a little different a
00:00:53 little different and the name of spain
00:00:58 comes from hispania hispania
00:01:04 and hispania was the name of the
00:01:09 iberian peninsula' of the entire peninsula not
00:01:14 only of spain but also of
00:01:18 portugal the entire iberian peninsula used to
00:01:23 be called hispania
00:01:26 and it was called hispania they
00:01:30 called it hispania the romans the
00:01:35 romans from rome invaded invaded
00:01:39 the peninsula they called it hispania
00:01:44 but the name hispania did not come from the
00:01:49 romans it was not the romans who
00:01:54 thought of the name it was the
00:01:58 phoenicians the phoenicians the phoenicians
00:02:02 lived by by  here around here and they came they
00:02:07 came to spain they came to spain and
00:02:13 now it is not known it is not very well known
00:02:18 why because they called it hispa  nia Hispania
00:02:22 and what did it mean I didn't know I don't
00:02:27 know I don't know 100% I don't
00:02:30 know 100
00:02:33 to 100% No
00:02:37 but the Romans The Romans thought they
00:02:42 thought that Hispania was Hispania
00:02:46 because in Spain there were many rabbits
00:02:51 there were rabbits
00:02:53 the rabbits were not  They like it, I'm going to jump, they
00:02:57 have a tail, such a tiny tail, and they
00:03:02 have ears, big ears,
00:03:06 not rabbits,
00:03:10 as in Spain, there were and there are many
00:03:13 rabbits, many rabbits, because the Romans
00:03:18 thought that Hispania Hispania
00:03:23 meant land, land of rabbits,
00:03:29 and with time, with time.  then
00:03:33 after a long time the name
00:03:36 hispania hispania changed
00:03:40 hispania changed and became
00:03:43 spanish
00:03:45 spain over time over time and with
00:03:49 changes it became spain and yes
00:03:54 now we call it spain but the
00:03:58 greeks the greeks in greece no the
00:04:03 greeks didn't call it  Hispania the
00:04:07 Iberian Peninsula was not called
00:04:10 Hispania they called it Iberia Iberia not
00:04:15 Iberia
00:04:18 that is why now now the entire peninsula the
00:04:23 peninsula where it is and  spain where
00:04:26 portugal is is called the iberian peninsula
00:04:30 comes from iberia from iberia iberia which is
00:04:36 the word that the greeks the greeks
00:04:39 used for the peninsula what do

00:02:49 glasses and the tube
00:02:54 and not and snorkeling diving in the
00:02:58 coves that you can see the water of the costa
00:03:02 brava is very cold and the water is very
00:03:04 transparent
00:03:05 the water of the sea is cold very
00:03:09 cold
00:03:10 for  that is transparent it will be seen and
00:03:13 seen from a long distance and there are many fish
00:03:18 clear clear clear there are
00:03:23 many times many times and alberto and I
00:03:28 swim a lot face to face
00:03:32 saná dais but you don't give very far you go to
00:03:37 the next 1 here h  there are more rocks and another

00:04:07 an octopus
00:04:11 yes yes me too I have also seen I have
00:04:14 seen octopuses on the Costa Brava
00:04:17 very well it is very common for octopuses to
00:04:21 hide among the rocks okay bottom of the
00:04:25 sea in the rocks here because the
00:04:28 octopus hides it does not hide
00:04:31 Between the seals, exactly, and you go, you go and
00:04:35 bother us, we go to the octopus to be able to see it
00:04:41 to see and since nothing,
00:04:43 you don't eat the octopus, no, well, we
00:04:47 don't eat it, but it's time to
00:04:52 mix and cook it in a restaurant
00:04:56 or in case of  eat the octopus very well
00:04:59 well this is the first first place the
00:05:02 costa brava not the second which is the
00:05:06 second alberto is the cantabrian
00:05:09 coast cantabrian coast of the community of
00:05:13 cantabria very good in cantabria
00:05:15 here no yes in cantabria also the coast
00:05:19 the coast of the sea  he  The sea area is not
00:05:25 and why because you like it we like it
00:05:28 because the landscape that can be seen on
00:05:31 this coast the whole landscape is not the
00:05:35 mountains
00:05:39 is very wild it is very steep they are
00:05:44 large walls that face the sea
00:05:49 casán sides cliffs
00:05:52 there is the sea and  then there are cliffs
00:05:56 like this
00:06:00 straight cliffs are impressive they are
00:06:05 very impressive very well behind
00:06:10 I like I like the cliffs
00:06:12 you on the cliffs here you go up
00:06:16 yes carefully to look but not to not
00:06:29 fall clear and he in the sea do it
00:06:34 like this if the water  It's very cold the same as
00:06:39 on the Costa Brava like the Costa Brava or
00:06:41 colder colder cold colder
00:06:44 but we really like swimming in the sea so
00:06:47 we also swim on the
00:06:51 sean tabra coast and on the Cantabrian coast it's
00:06:54 nice to snorkel scuba dive
00:06:59 the sea is very rough in the sea there
00:07:04 are waves a lot of waves there are big waves very
00:07:08 big ok it is not very safe it did not
00:07:12 arrive today safe bar a little dangerous
00:07:15 no
00:07:16 a little dangerous nothing in the sea very
00:07:20 dangerous to swim  deep into the sea
00:07:23 because there are many on the beach it is not very
00:07:27 dangerous but if you go in if you go
00:07:31 into the sea then it is dangerous
00:07:34 dangerous it is worth very well on the
00:07:38 Cantabrian coast you can see many people
00:07:40 surfing surfing by many
00:07:45 waves of course surfing
00:07:49 with  the hours where the waves are
00:07:54 surfing because the waves are very
00:07:58 big
00:07:59 oysters I like I like I really like
00:08:02 surfing
00:08:04 if I want I will also go to Cantabria go
00:08:07 to the Cantabrian coast because there you will
00:08:09 meet a lot of people who also
00:08:12 like to do a lot  surfing is worth a lot a lot of
00:08:15 people a lot of people doing surf that
00:08:18 good that good we would like to
00:08:20 learn
00:08:22 I have never never been to Cantabria
00:08:25 never been to the north coast of
00:08:29 Spain
00:08:30 Cantabrian coast and the third the third
00:08:35 site
00:08:37 which site is the third site that  it is
00:08:40 called the pyrenees the pyrenees the pyrenees
00:08:43 the pyrenees are here
00:08:49 and they are mountains they are mountains they
00:08:56 are high mountains very high photos
00:08:59 some are slightly higher than 3000
00:09:02 meters  It's
00:09:02 worth more than 3000 meters some
00:09:07 some mountains and why because
00:09:11 you like the Pyrenees because there are
00:09:15 impressive landscapes
00:09:17 also the landscapes are not the landscapes
00:09:20 are impressive impressions and above
00:09:23 all I like to walk in the
00:09:25 mountains
00:09:26 now well trek and walk walk
00:09:28 you really like impressive things
00:09:34 and go up vice walking that you are going to
00:09:39 walk up the mountain to climb up to
00:09:42 the tops
00:09:44 to the tops of the mountains and we sleep
00:09:47 on the way in a tent or
00:09:50 on the way no maybe you are going to jordi  along
00:09:53 a road and you stop and sleep in a
00:09:57 tent
00:09:58 on a farm
00:10:00 a tent you can sleep here
00:10:04 in the tent and then the next day we
00:10:07 continue rude like this it's better than good
00:10:11 how fun yes I also really like
00:10:14 camping sleeping in a tent
00:10:18 I like it I like it very much very well
00:10:21 there is something more interesting in the Pyrenees
00:10:24 in winter it snows very cold of course it snows
00:10:30 snow falls a lot of snow
00:10:34 every snow you can ski  go skiing and you
00:10:38 can't ski
00:10:41 and you go skiing
00:10:44 we like to ski
00:10:49 alberto makes snow white a very
00:10:54 good ski so I also really like
00:10:57 skiing and snowboarding now I
00:11:01 especially like snow but when I was
00:11:04 little I also ski too  I did alone I
00:11:07 only did skiing it
00:11:10 's very good because then the

00:00:08 good so we bought the
00:00:10 chair what's the problem we don't think
00:00:13 we don't think how to get the chair to
00:00:16 the badass residence we don't think how to get
00:00:19 it from here to the residence on
00:00:22 the residence street don't think we don't
00:00:23 think  we don't know how to do it first
00:00:26 we tried to put it on the bus on a
00:00:29 bus on the bus ok and on the
00:00:33 bus that the driver passed the person
00:00:36 who is here driving the driver
00:00:39 who is driving no he didn't let us he said no i say
00:00:43 you can't then we tried in a taxi
00:00:46 we tried  put the chair in a taxi
00:00:49 fit in a taxi
00:00:52 but it didn't fit you couldn't put the
00:00:56 chair inside the taxi inside the taxi
00:00:58 you couldn't the chair was too
00:01:01 big exactly and the taxi was too
00:01:04 small then the chair didn't fit inside
00:01:07 the taxi like that  that we could only carry it
00:01:11 like this the two of us carrying it carrying
00:01:14 each other
00:01:15 but what's the problem
00:01:17 the chair was very heavy the chair was very heavy it
00:01:20 was very ex  act 200 kilos at 300 it
00:01:31 weighed a lot and then of course after
00:01:37 a while after a while we were very
00:01:40 tired carrying it carrying it lola of course
00:01:43 for example look also I'm tall no
00:01:46 I'm tall and thin michael this
00:01:51 one this is up to date it's striped it
00:01:53 's like that  this was michael no so of
00:02:00 course one had the chair so the
00:02:03 other underneath was it was difficult to
00:02:06 transport because it was waiting we are going to
00:02:08 make a drawing
00:02:10 a day no
00:02:13 adrià and how is michael and michael
00:02:19 carrying the chair and
00:02:26 so so after  A while
00:02:31 after a while our backs hurt
00:02:33 here behind us our voice didn't hurt so it's
00:02:36 true
00:02:39 we couldn't we couldn't anymore so
00:02:43 luckily luckily we saw a man a
00:02:47 man who was selling strawberries a man who
00:02:50 was selling gamer who was selling
00:02:53 strawberries exactly  here this man and strawberries you
00:02:57 draw very well balloon but just in case
00:03:00 this is not the case
00:03:10 there was a man who sold
00:03:13 our prisoners
00:03:17 but he sold the strawberries from a
00:03:21 truck more or less one from a pick
00:03:24 up  through something more or less like this
00:03:26 guayaquil sold its prey all of this
00:03:29 were companies all of this but not so
00:03:35 good he had a truck with strawberries with
00:03:39 strawberries
00:03:40 we said i don't have any more we
00:03:44 asked this man could we
00:03:47 put the chair on the strawberries on top of
00:03:52 his  truck strawberries less than a year
00:03:55 in the truck
00:03:55 exactly no if you could bring us the
00:03:59 chair
00:03:59 up to the residence up to the
00:04:02 student residence the residence this is the
00:04:06 residence where the residence would have lived exactly
00:04:09 and I wanted to expose the armchair in the
00:04:13 back that next one here  and not put the
00:04:17 chair
00:04:21 and the exact residence, so we talked
00:04:25 to that man and he told us that yes,
00:04:28 if we gave a little
00:04:30 money, a little money, money to the
00:04:33 man, exactly, he would take the chair
00:04:36 to the exact residence, so what
00:04:41 did we do?  man stood here the
00:04:44 man was driving ok and here the
00:04:47 strawberries most also put them here he put a
00:04:50 lot of strawberries here then all this  it was
00:04:53 companies
00:04:55 so we were in here the man
00:04:57 driving a and michael a
00:05:02 good at first me and i also in here
00:05:04 adrià was inside exactly
00:05:07 inside together with the driver with the
00:05:09 driver me and all the strawberries in
00:05:12 general that michael was behind exactly
00:05:15 okay it's that  It's in the back there was
00:05:17 no room at the end either, behind there were
00:05:20 only strawberries and the chair
00:05:25 okay so mangel there were only
00:05:27 strawberries and the chair there was no space for
00:05:30 Maikel to sit of course to sit down
00:05:33 so michael got on the chair and
00:05:35 he put himself here on the chair and  We went to
00:05:40 the residence but
00:05:42 I also thought it was very funny
00:05:43 so I also sat on the chair for a whole month
00:05:46 but I want to change the way
00:05:48 we changed Adrià was amused
00:05:50 hahaha look look sitting sitting on
00:05:53 the chair so a  day he also thought
00:05:55 ayub I'm also with the axis and he sat down
00:05:58 it's him they also changed adrià and mickael
00:06:01 they changed no and adrià sat in zion
00:06:04 and mickael was m  He got in with the driver, it
00:06:07 was well seen and if he was
00:06:11 basically passing by, this was luckily there were no
00:06:15 police on the farm, already police or there
00:06:18 were no police, nobody saw them, we got
00:06:20 here without problems and when
00:06:24 we both picked up the chair again
00:06:27 and  We entered inside the residence and
00:06:30 when we entered there was at the reception the
00:06:34 reception there is a table yes long wood
00:06:37 girls there were here no here there were two
00:06:39 girls ok at reception here at the
00:06:41 entrance of the residence it is absdon the
00:06:44 girls were very surprised they
00:06:47 looked at us it is of  Like when they gave
00:06:49 us an armchair because in theory, in
00:06:53 fact, you can't, you can't bring
00:06:55 such big things into the room,
00:06:57 no, but we can't bring furniture, furniture,
00:07:00 at once, so big, they do
00:07:02 n't let you, but we didn't say, we didn't
00:07:04 say.  nothing and console and we went in if the
00:07:07 girls didn't say anything I think the
00:07:10 girls thought uff they don't speak
00:07:13 Chinese we don't speak English it's
00:07:16 too complicated to
00:07:19 leave them  to do it was it was a it was a
00:07:22 residence a little strange it wasn't they
00:07:25 weren't very written no I don't care about

00:05:57 hours of French yes yes that's a
00:06:00 lot of hours
00:06:02 but I wanted to see I wanted to see if my level
00:06:06 of French was going to improve and I wanted to see if
00:06:13 my pronunciation the pronunciation  with the
00:06:19 pronunciation in french the accent
00:06:22 also improved if i wanted to see i wanted to
00:06:27 see and i heard i heard a lot of french without
00:06:33 reading without reading french
00:06:38 and speaking without speaking french
00:06:44 my level my level of french
00:06:48 improved it improved a lot and now now
00:06:53 i can talk i can talk to a
00:06:55 person with a  French person I can
00:07:00 speak more or less more or less well not
00:07:03 very well
00:07:06 my French is worse than my Japanese e  l
00:07:11 Japanese the Japanese language of Japan no
00:07:17 Japanese I speak
00:07:21 better Japanese
00:07:23 I speak it at a higher level higher
00:07:27 than French
00:07:30 but but no the level of French is not bad
00:07:36 but there is one thing I would change that
00:07:41 I would do differently if another  Once he studied
00:07:46 French I start to study French to
00:07:50 learn French and it is that in these 800
00:07:56 hours I listened to many audiobooks
00:08:02 audiobooks are books that have been recorded
00:08:07 that someone has recorded on a tape not
00:08:12 that they have recorded with a microphone the
00:08:17 speech speaks someone has recorded and you
00:08:20 listen to them  you listen to them in sound you
00:08:24 listen to them well with an mp3 an mp3 or
00:08:30 something is the book but someone has spoken
00:08:33 it has read it once upon a time in a corner
00:08:36 of La Mancha they tax them and you can
00:08:40 listen listen to the books well I
00:08:44 listened I listened to many audiobooks
00:08:49 audiobooks in  French and it was very
00:08:54 funny I liked it I liked it a lot I
00:08:59 really liked listening to listening to the books
00:09:02 but I want I want to listen to more
00:09:08 language more colloquial words more
00:09:13 normal than  people people
00:09:17 use to talk to each other when they
00:09:21 talk they don't speak blah blah blah blah blah
00:09:25 blah blah
00:09:26 when they speak they used words they used
00:09:31 language they used different vocabulary
00:09:35 different from books and I I want to
00:09:39 hear more more colloquial
00:09:44 language everyday language language of the  day by day
00:09:47 more common language of conversation
00:09:50 listening to more conversation between people
00:09:55 and I think if I listen to more
00:09:58 conversation I will be able to speak I will be
00:10:00 able to speak French better yes and that
00:10:05 is one thing that I would change listening to
00:10:09 listening to less audiobooks and listening to
00:10:13 more conversation
00:10:16 natural conversations between people
00:10:20 and you  Do you like French Do

00:10:30 interesting language or not what do

00:10:42 not we don't like to say it say it below in

259,"00:00:00 Today adrià and I are going to play a game
00:00:05 yes yes another game
00:00:08 we have to think of
00:00:10 a character a person or not that is
00:00:16 real if real like gandhi for example or
00:00:21 donald trump
00:00:23 donald trump is real give the dragon
00:00:28 and I think unfortunately if it is real and
00:00:31 true unfortunately and or fictitious
00:00:35 like harry potter like harry potter or
00:00:38 pikachu or pikachu and we think of a
00:00:43 character and we don't say it no we don't have
00:00:48 the ones to ask questions of course we have to
00:00:51 ask questions to guess for now
00:00:54 or guess who this character is
00:00:59 I understand it
00:00:59 very well
00:01:01 [  Music]
00:01:07 good now well yes adrià he has
00:01:12 thought of a character he has thought of a
00:01:15 character's self and I have thought of a
00:01:18 character very well and we ask questions
00:01:21 but the maximum is the limit of 20 20
00:01:27 questions at the most ok he asked him
00:01:29 if you already got it  Have you thought if I have thought of
00:01:32 a character is I start by
00:01:35 asking questions okay
00:01:37 is a fictional character settles for a
00:01:42 fictional character a fictional character
00:01:45 like for example harry potter co  mo
00:01:48 harry potter subnormal yes
00:01:51 this is a fictional character
00:01:55 inside on ag fictional is
00:01:58 is human is human is a person a
00:02:02 person like adriá or like me like adrián
00:02:05 basically not like not like trump
00:02:07 traps not entering go the week that
00:02:10 humans are like that  human okay is a person very
00:02:14 good and it is a name that is to say not a
00:02:18 woman is a man a man is not male
00:02:22 male is not female they were activated it is but
00:02:25 that's how it is a is a man okay very well
00:02:28 so I wonder if he
00:02:32 has
00:02:34 there is something he has  some power his
00:02:39 supernatural supernatural a supernatural power
00:02:42 like a flying ball can
00:02:47 draw fire united or can read you can
00:02:51 know your thoughts to what he
00:02:55 does not have supernatural power no 44
00:03:03 is he is less than 20 years
00:03:08 of age less than 20 exactly
00:03:15 I think I think that  no no no he is not under
00:03:18 20 I think he is over reims over 20
00:03:21 years old very good
00:03:22 [Music]
00:03:23 van 5 he lives he lives in the same world in
00:03:29 the same universe as you and I he doesn't live he
00:03:33 lives in a world in which world he doesn't  class  ro
00:03:37 the earth normally yes yes but a
00:03:41 world like ours the same as
00:03:43 ours the same as ours with the
00:03:45 same if you live
00:03:51 in the 20th or 21st
00:03:55 century 20th or 21st century that is to say the 21st century 1900
00:04:01 test
00:04:02 2000 laurent I think I think there is  there are
00:04:09 cars of cars there are cars yes yes yes very
00:04:15 well it is another little question well
00:04:19 interesting is a man over 20
00:04:23 years old lives in this very well so I
00:04:26 originally wondered at the beginning when it
00:04:31 started when this character started when this character was
00:04:33 created it appeared in  books
00:04:37 in books
00:04:41 in a book originally exact a
00:04:46 book to read is not a book no is not
00:04:49 a character in the book and appeared in
00:04:53 in a movie in a movie in a
00:04:58 movie in the movie exact
00:05:01 is not a movie character from a
00:05:04 movie not very  Well, he is not a
00:05:07 movie character from a movie, well, if he is
00:05:11 from an audiovisual material, that is,
00:05:14 movies, television, video games, things
00:05:18 with audio, sound, and audio-visual images, he
00:05:22 is an actor, he pointed out,
00:05:26 if he is a  audiovisual medium
00:05:29 it is not only auditory it is not only
00:05:34 visual visual okay this
00:05:37 originally appeared on tv yes
00:05:41 on tv on television he
00:05:44 is a boy without he is a boy with
00:05:47 special powers television he does not have
00:05:50 supernatural powers very well and very well he has
00:05:55 a dangerous
00:05:58 job his job  This person's work
00:06:02 am
00:06:03 no no that's dangerous
00:06:07 it's not dangerous it's not very dangerous very
00:06:11 well it's more dangerous than yours
00:06:13 but it's not very dangerous it's not a policeman
00:06:17 I understand and I'm thinking it's
00:06:22 to this television series not this
00:06:25 TV show  television in which he
00:06:27 appeared is a program made in
00:06:32 the 80s or later that is to say a program
00:06:37 made in 1980 81 82 or 91 92
00:06:47 80 of the 80s or muhammad be now see and
00:06:51 I think I think it is not what it is
00:06:56 before  1980 I think it's very good it
00:07:04 's a program from this program it appeared
00:07:07 on American TV on American TV
00:07:11 USA but from the state
00:07:14 originally
00:07:16 I think so I think so American not
00:07:20 British no
00:07:25 and you know him  Is this a boy a white boy
00:07:32 if the skin
00:07:36 is real I have no idea what
00:07:40 superpower he is he has a little
00:07:43 something of something power but he is
00:07:45 not supernatural it is not something impossible but
00:07:48 if he has something I can do
00:07:51 I am thinking about others
00:07:56 and  that was a program to laugh great
00:07:59 program a comedy this
00:08:01 tv program was a comedy it makes me laugh yes it
00:08:06 has magically comedy
00:08:09 elements of comedy for laughter yes yes
00:08:14 you're already 15 i'm not going to fill it it's a
00:08:19 program that has a script it's a program
00:08:23 with a script that is exact written grain
00:08:28 that you know they tell them things it is
00:08:31 written that we need this
00:08:33 person who says it is not improvised and yes
00:08:37 because this type of program it is
00:08:41 impossible to make it improvised it is
00:08:44 impossible this guy is a fictional character
00:08:50 if he appeared to you  on TV if before
00:08:54 the 80s surely it
00:08:57 is a program that is impossible to do
00:09:00 improvised and revised
00:09:02 improvised I have no idea not those
00:09:05 of those who give me four questions it is a
00:09:08 show mostly for kids for
00:09:11 kids for little people and jerk off and
00:09:16 boys like that if it's for kids
00:09:21 because in his nest he's assumed he was an
00:09:26 actor but it's a cartoon if it's a
00:09:29 cartoon that's what the
00:09:31 name draw if it's  a drawing like mickey
00:09:35 mouse or because I was thinking about if you
00:09:38 haven't thought it
00:09:42 was from the looney tunes
00:09:45 is the looney tunes are from warner warner
00:09:48 bros how are some animals if there is
00:09:52 any human someone is
00:09:54 thinking about the
00:09:55 hostel along or not
00:10:03 a  clue is the main character is
00:10:08 the main one but it is his program you might
00:10:10 wonder is he the protagonist it is
00:10:12 important to know the name having
00:10:17 money something about the color
00:10:23 I have lost you have no one a
00:10:27 final question a final question who is it yes no
00:10:31 ask yes no to sportsman putt
00:10:39 You don't have
00:10:41 Popeye
00:10:53 but you know that he knows his name and he is a
00:10:59 Popeye character. He was a
00:11:03 sailor and had a boat, well, he would have

00:11:18 I have to ask the questions if not and

00:01:25 quack quack duck  and there is an elephant
00:01:29 no the characters speak Spanish from
00:01:33 Spain Spanish from Spain not
00:01:38 Latin American Spanish and Pocoyo is very easy to
00:01:44 talk about
00:01:47 the colors of different shapes of
00:01:52 round squares but it is very
00:01:58 entertaining it is entertaining yes yes but
00:02:01 well pocoyo is a bit is  A bit for
00:02:05 children, for children, not for the elderly, it's not
00:02:11 much for the elderly, it's for children and well,
00:02:16 you can try it.  and look
00:02:21 at it to see if you like
00:02:24 the second one the second one is also
00:02:30 a cartoon
00:02:33 but it's a cartoon that children like
00:02:38 they like and
00:02:42 older people like it too yes yes and this this
00:02:48 cartoon is pepa and pepe
00:02:54 p
00:02:57 and  pepa peek is in both it is in
00:03:02 Spanish from Spain and also in
00:03:07 Latin American Spanish you can find it on
00:03:11 youtube
00:03:13 on youtube you can find both the one
00:03:17 from Spain and the one from Latin America
00:03:20 and pep active is very good it is not as
00:03:24 easy as easy as pocoyo  but
00:03:30 hey it's easy it's quite easy and it's a
00:03:33 lot of fun I also have fun
00:03:37 when I look when I look but daddy not
00:03:42 the third the third is extra extra
00:03:50 Spanish extra extra in Spanish you
00:03:54 can also find it on youtube
00:03:58 and extras it's extra in Spanish it's not a
00:04:02 series one  normal television series it
00:04:06 is not a series for you it is a series
00:04:10 for people who learn Spanish and it is
00:04:15 easy it is very easy easy to understand and
00:04:20 I also think you will like it and the
00:04:24 last one the fourth  the last one is also a
00:04:31 cartoon
00:04:33 but it's a cartoon from argentina
00:04:37 from argentina so they speak spanish from
00:04:43 argentina so i forgot in extra
00:04:48 extra extra they speak spanish from spain
00:04:53 speak the version from spain and in the
00:04:58 room in this cartoon they speak
00:05:03 spanish from  argentina and it's called mundo
00:05:07 zamba mundo zamba and mundo zamba
00:05:11 is also on youtube and I'll put a link
00:05:15 down below in the description I'll put
00:05:18 a link for you to go
00:05:23 to the different ones the different series or
00:05:26 cartoons
00:05:29 world fame is it's fun you can
00:05:34 Listen to Spanish, a Spanish a little
00:05:37 different from the one from Argentina
00:05:40 and it is also very interesting because they
00:05:43 talk about different things from the
00:05:45 history of science from the history of
00:05:49 Argentina too and I think you may find it
00:05:52 interesting finally there is another
00:05:57 series another television series
00:06:01 for you too  for people who are
00:06:04 learning Spanish and I've been
00:06:08 looking at it I've been looking at it a bit
00:06:10 but I don't like it  I don't like this I don't
00:06:17 like it very much because they speak a lot of
00:06:22 English so I don't quite like it it's
00:06:27 the series destinations destinations I don't like it
00:06:32 because most of the time they are
00:06:37 talking about other things they don't really speak
00:06:40 Spanish it's not the same as a
00:06:43 series  normal then destinations destinations
00:06:48 there are many sites on the internet in many
00:06:51 sites they
00:06:52 recommend destinations but I do not recommend it to us
00:06:59 I recommend these 4 pocoyo pepa peak
00:07:02 extra and a zamba world and if you
00:07:09 know other series other series
00:07:12 also very easy please tell me

00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:18 Hi guys I'm Andrea and today I'm going
00:00:22 to tell you a story this story
00:00:26 goes like this a long time ago there was a
00:00:32 very rich king who had a lot  money and he was
00:00:38 king king of a castle ok
00:00:44 and he had a daughter
00:00:46 here the daughter's name was and you're the same he's
00:00:52 a strange man difficult to pronounce
00:00:55 but the daughter's name was you're the same this
00:01:01 daughter was in love she
00:01:05 was in love with a warrior she was a
00:01:10 warrior with a warrior  a
00:01:14 brave warrior and very strong strength
00:01:21 she fell in love with him and they both
00:01:27 fell in love very much love ok
00:01:31 they both fell in love
00:01:33 the king told them ok ok perfect super
00:01:40 good he said yes to them both being together
00:01:45 the king said yes I like the
00:01:52 couple  but but they both wanted to
00:01:56 get married they wanted to get married a
00:02:02 ring ok on their hand the ring they
00:02:06 didn't want to get married and the king told them yes
00:02:10 they can get married but what do you think happened
00:02:13 because there were many  you fight at that time at
00:02:19 that time and then the king said to
00:02:25 popocatépetl and it was his name he told him
00:02:29 you have to go to war
00:02:32 to fight you have to go fight against
00:02:36 the other people you have to go fight and
00:02:40 he said yes ok then  the father the
00:02:46 king of this I'm still here told the
00:02:51 warrior to go fight to fight
00:02:55 to go fight against the other
00:02:59 people to go fight and the
00:03:03 chief the king sent many soldiers many
00:03:10 soldiers of the kingdom of the castle of the
00:03:15 castle  to protect the castle of
00:03:21 pum pum pum wars ok so
00:03:30 popocatépetl went with everyone to fight against another
00:03:37 town another castle yes before saying
00:03:44 goodbye goodbye
00:03:48 popocatépetl and he told the princess he
00:03:52 told her that when he returned from the
00:03:56 war they were going to get married  they were going to
00:04:02 get married and he went to fight and she said
00:04:07 bye bye goodbye
00:04:11 so what do you think
00:04:15 popocatépetl won he won the battle he won and
00:04:22 then in the castle here the princess
00:04:28 the princess was sad because
00:04:32 popocatépetl had not returned  He
00:04:36 had not returned to the castle and he felt
00:04:40 sad, poor thing, so someone
00:04:46 else a person went to the castle he
00:04:51 went to the castle and told
00:04:55 the king and the princess and you are the same as
00:05:00 the one that popocatépetl had died that he
00:05:05 had died but it was not true he
00:05:12 was alive  then the princess and you're the
00:05:17 same she got very sad because she
00:05:22 thought that her beloved her beloved had died
00:05:30 and then the princess didn't eat then
00:05:36 the princess was very sad because she
00:05:40 thought that he had died
00:05:45 and then because she was very sad very
00:05:49 sad she cried a lot  The princess did not
00:05:55 eat the princess did not eat the food and
00:06:01 then she turned white. What do you think,
00:06:04 since the princess did not
00:06:08 eat, the princess died from not eating
00:06:13 and out of sadness, so the princess
00:06:17 was dead
00:06:21 the princess was dead and then
00:06:25 popocatépetl returned to the castle the
00:06:30 return to the castle  and he told him he told the
00:06:36 king he told him that he had won he
00:06:40 won the victory he won he won the battle but
00:06:49 the king told Popocatépetl that the
00:06:54 princess is seawell he had died
00:07:01 not
00:07:03 popocatépetl he went quickly with the
00:07:07 dead princess and took her the two
00:07:13 popocatépetl carried the princess and
00:07:18 he left he took in his
00:07:24 hands a torch with fire and the
00:07:30 popocatépetl left he went away
00:07:35 the  king did not know where the princess was
00:07:41 the princess and popocatépetl and
00:07:45 popocatépetl did not know
00:07:49 after a long time the people
00:07:55 of the castle the people of the castle
00:07:59 said
00:08:01 they saw with their eyes they saw
00:08:06 with their eyes that 212 that two mountains
00:08:13 volcanoes
00:08:17 had come out magic has appeared
00:08:23 like  two volcanoes had appeared
00:08:30 just like magic behind
00:08:34 [Music]
00:08:35 then the king the king of the castle said
00:08:42 he said they two are these and
00:08:48 popocatépetl because they both died together
00:08:54 they both died together and they two
00:08:59 the volcanoes were popocatépetl and
00:09:04 iztaccihuatl and they both stayed
00:09:08 together and they died together and they

00:10:22 people say that when the
00:10:27 wet

00:03:50 to give the flavor
00:03:53 to the  flavor of tea the flock you know the
00:03:58 serious error right because with this it is
00:04:02 given the flavor that makes it different from
00:04:05 other tests
00:04:08 this is the jackfruit jackfruit or already fruit in
00:04:13 English

00:10:37 are so good they don't have
00:10:40 seeds they don't have seeds no no they don't have seeds they
00:10:43 can be eaten like this

00:10:57 later of course there are mangoes here in
00:11:02 Thailand  many and many types of
00:11:06 mango and yesterday I bought I bought 22 types of
00:11:13 mango
00:11:14 let's go try the first ones
00:11:17 first the small one I'm going to appeal
00:11:26 to see I'm going to try it it
00:11:34 's ok but this mango this type of
00:11:38 mango is not a sweet mango no no it's not
00:11:43 sweet
00:11:45 in  thailand yes they have many many
00:11:48 types of mango they have a mango that is
00:11:52 acidic they have this one that is not acidic but
00:11:57 it is not sweet either no no and it is a mango that they
00:12:03 use by dipping it in sauces or
00:12:08 dipping it in sugar and eating it
00:12:14 And now I'm going to appeal this this mango
00:12:17 this is sweet
00:12:22 it's the same it's the same as the
00:12:26 ones we eat in Europe in Spain
00:12:37 [Music]
00:12:44 [Applause] it
00:12:48 's very sweet it's very good
00:12:52 I love it I love it I love
00:12:55 mango and  Lastly, the guava, but look,
00:13:01 look
00:13:03 behind this, it's a guava.
00:13:08 I think it's the biggest guava
00:13:11 I've ever seen in my life,
00:13:14 because I don't know, I don't know if you've
00:13:19 eaten guavas in America. In
00:13:23 America, guavas are small.
00:13:26 less and inside they are
00:13:32 red but these are not here in
00:13:36 thailand look look here the guavas
00:13:40 are white white in color
00:13:46 1
00:13:49 this is good it is
00:13:53 a texture similar to pear like
00:13:58 pear but harder
00:14:02 and it is not not very sweet  no no it does not have
00:14:08 a
00:14:09 very strong flavor no it is not very easy
00:14:13 very easy to eat a lot a lot of
00:14:17 guava
00:14:18 and that's it that's all these are all the
00:14:23 types of strange fruit that I found in the
00:14:27 market here in Thailand there are
00:14:31 other types of fruit but  I don't know  on
00:14:35 season it's not the season now ok

00:00:58 also saw the boy and after a
00:01:03 while they began to say hello they began
00:01:06 to say hello to greet each other they followed wave by
00:01:10 wave and then they began to talk to
00:01:15 each other to talk hello
00:01:17 how are you bla bla bla bla yes yes  yes and
00:01:21 always whenever the boy and
00:01:25 the girl saw each

00:01:40 him he started to like the girl a little yes
00:01:44 yes yes
00:01:45 but one day  the boy the boy
00:01:50 was  He was sitting
00:01:54 and he saw he saw the girl he saw the girl
00:02:00 but the girl didn't see the boy ccc and the
00:02:05 girl stayed very close to the door of
00:02:10 the door
00:02:12 yes yes yes then everyone
00:02:15 everyone what was
00:02:17 coming in the people coming in
00:02:22 not all the
00:02:25 people people had problems entering
00:02:28 because the girl was in the middle so
00:02:33 to enter people had to do that
00:02:38 because the girl was bothering her she was
00:02:41 in the middle yes yes but the girl didn't
00:02:45 notice no she wasn't there thinking about her
00:02:49 things  He didn't realize and that happened many
00:02:54 times 55 times that the bus
00:03:00 come to get on get on people got on once
00:03:03 twice three times four times five
00:03:07 times yes yes yes and the boy who saw this
00:03:11 thought the girl why why is she in the
00:03:15 middle why I don't know  move away
00:03:18 because she doesn't go inside
00:03:22 no I don't understand and every time
00:03:26 she saw that the girl didn't move away
00:03:30 she liked her less she didn't like her - - - yes
00:03:36 yes
00:03:38 and the five times the bus
00:03:42 stopped she started to like it o  dislike or
00:03:46 dislike  ar no one two three four five
00:03:50 times and
00:03:53 and then after seeing this the girl
00:03:57 doesn't like him anymore no no no
00:04:02 what do you think is a good reason
00:04:06 this is a good reason for you not to
00:04:09 like a person the fact that this
00:04:13 person doesn't no  he realizes that he is in the
00:04:17 middle that he is bothering others
00:04:20 what do you guys think to write write
00:04:24 down in the comments okay come alone
00:04:34 and I started to like it we started
",2
031,"00:00:00 so
00:00:02 hello today I'm going to talk about kisses
00:00:09 yes yes yes
00:00:11 and I'm going to talk about the first kiss the
00:00:15 first time of your whole
00:00:18 life to say to someone no the
00:00:23 first kiss
00:00:26 can be it
00:00:28 can be with a boy
00:00:32 or with a girl
00:00:34 yes  and I think that when we are little
00:00:40 many people many of us play the game the
00:00:45 game of the bottle that there is a bottle
00:00:48 a bottle
00:00:52 and it spins the
00:00:56 bottle spins yes yes and when the bottle separates
00:01:00 the two people the two people
00:01:06 these two  people have to
00:01:09 kiss each other yes yes yes well these these kisses don't
00:01:14 count these don't count no no the
00:01:19 first kiss the first real kiss
00:01:23 has to be because the other person from
00:01:26 gustavo costas
00:01:28 yes yes yes and the first time you kiss
00:01:33 someone is normal to be nervous to be
00:01:38 nervous
00:01:39 yes yes it is normal but you have to
00:01:43 control the controlled ones so that the
00:01:47 other person no does not see it no no no
00:01:50 breathe
00:01:53 breathe deeply
00:01:58 yes yes because if when you see each other if
00:02:04 you see each other and the lips if the lips
00:02:08 they tremble
00:02:10 then it's the same as kissing kissing a
00:02:15 tractor yes yes yes so
00:02:19 breathe and what to do with your hands
00:02:24 hands where to put them when
00:02:27 when you're kissing someone well one
00:02:31 option one option is when you're
00:02:34 kissing hug hug the other
00:02:38 person like this
00:02:40 yes yes yes another option is on the backrest
00:02:44 on the backrest your hand here yes yes yes
00:02:48 later another option is behind the
00:02:51 head like this
00:02:54 without any problem but above all you don't
00:02:58 have to clap
00:03:01 no no no don't clap jce clap never
00:03:04 never it's appropriate okay like this  that the hands
00:03:07 on the back of the other person on the
00:03:11 head and the most important thing when
00:03:18 you see someone is to close your eyes close your eyes they
00:03:22 have to be closed like that
00:03:25 yes yes yes because if you are
00:03:29 kissing someone and you open your eyes and
00:03:33 they  they also open their eyes and you see each other it
00:03:37 is very very
00:03:40 uncomfortable very uncomfortable it is more uncomfortable
00:03:44 than you trying to touch those five and that
00:03:48 the other
00:03:50 person holds your hand
00:03:54 yes yes yes well opening your eyes when you
00:03:58 kiss is more
00:04:02 more  uncomfortable you also have to be
00:04:07 careful with your nose yes yes
00:04:11 because if you are not careful you can
00:04:14 touch nose nose to nose yes yes
00:04:19 yes and we are not Eskimos no no
00:04:22 no so so you have
00:04:26 to rotate your head yes  You have to rotate to the
00:04:30 right, to the right, to the left,
00:04:33 not to the right, and you have to rotate a
00:04:38 little, just a little, because if it rotates a
00:04:42 lot, you become spider-man,
00:04:51 yes, yes, and you are not spider-man, are
00:04:54 you not?  then a kiss
00:04:58 can be dry or wet and the first time it
00:05:04 better be dry and to use the tongue
00:05:10 it is already a higher level of difficulty yes
00:05:14 yes yes you have to have more and more
00:05:17 experience okay but above all
00:05:20 especially in your first kiss you have to
00:05:24 relax and enjoy enjoy because it
00:05:28 is a very special occasion and you
00:05:31 have any more recommendations for
00:05:35 people for people who have never
00:05:39 kissed anyone write write below
00:05:42 in the comments
00:05:43 our recommendations ok come on

294,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about cross talk and
00:00:05 why because I think that crosstalk
00:00:10 is the fastest
00:00:15 way to improve in Spanish to
00:00:19 improve in any language
00:00:24 [Music]
00:00:30 I do believe that crosstalk is faster
00:00:36 than going to school  and even yes yes yes
00:00:41 even faster than looking at dreaming
00:00:45 spanish if crosstalk is also good for
00:00:50 any language for english french
00:00:55 chinese any language then what is
00:01:00 crosstalk what is
00:01:04 crosstalk is it an exchange
00:01:09 exchange language exchange
00:01:11 then in cross start a person with
00:01:16 another person need each other  22 people or
00:01:20 more and they are speaking they are
00:01:24 exchanging languages ​​but when you
00:01:29 exchange languages
00:01:34 normally it
00:01:37 changes the language changes first
00:01:43 I don't know first a language
00:01:46 then
00:01:49 another language does not change it
00:01:54 changes
00:01:58 for example for example 10 minutes
00:02:02 a language 10 minutes
00:02:05 the other language
00:02:08 but with rose talk not with cross start it
00:02:12 is not like that not with cross start a person
00:02:16 hab  the one language one person speaks a
00:02:21 language and the other person the other person
00:02:25 speaks the other language and always yes yes and
00:02:31 each person speaks their language their own
00:02:35 language you are not practicing speaking you
00:02:40 are not practicing listening you have to
00:02:43 listen
00:02:45 and why because it is good  crosstalk
00:02:49 first it's very easy it's easier than a
00:02:54 normal exchange
00:02:58 because you only have to understand
00:03:01 you have to understand what your
00:03:04 partner says the other person is more
00:03:07 relaxed it's very relaxed because you don't
00:03:12 have to be thinking thinking oh my
00:03:17 name
00:03:19 you don't have to be thinking you can
00:03:21 listen you can listen to the other
00:03:24 person and also when you start even if
00:03:29 you start a language from scratch if for
00:03:34 example if I want to learn
00:03:37 Swahili tomorrow and I want to learn Arabic I can
00:03:41 do crosstalk yes yes
00:03:44 like well the same as me the same as
00:03:50 dreaming spanish with drawings drawing
00:03:54 with gestures  with pictures with pictures with
00:04:02 color maps the same as me the
00:04:10 same as my videos you can
00:04:14 do crosstalk  and you can exchange
00:04:17 languages ​​if your level is already high it is
00:04:22 higher it is not from scratch you can use the
00:04:26 internet you can use
00:04:29 a computer a computer with the camera
00:04:32 not the computer camera and
00:04:36 make video calls skype for example
00:04:40 but if you start from scratch it is better to
00:04:45 do it  In person go to a cafe for
00:04:49 example and talk to another person
00:04:53 why
00:04:55 with the computer it is not easy to draw
00:04:58 draw and such is not not so easy it is
00:05:02 better with a notebook
00:05:05 with a notebook
00:05:07 and drawing and if you don't have a partner
00:05:12 if you don't know  nobody can use
00:05:17 tandem or use
00:05:20 hello talk tandem and hello such
00:05:25 are mobile applications they are mobile apps
00:05:29 that you can install and you can
00:05:31 find partners to do
00:05:34 language exchange
00:05:37 so crosstalk try it try it
00:05:40 to see if you like it and tell me how it is
00:05:44 tell me how  how did it go if it
00:05:47 went well if it didn't go well if you have
00:05:50 questions you have more questions
00:05:53 ask me below in the comments
00:05:55 okay and if you like it if you like it  This is my channel,
00:06:00 my videos
00:06:03 and you want to help me and the pattern and the
00:06:07 pattern page

00:03:26 chair on top of a car
00:03:30 look
00:03:34 when I was pregnant or one of my
00:03:37 best friends
00:03:39 I had had had had a friend is tall my
00:03:42 friend a friend of mine was called michael
00:03:49 like that because from time to time he
00:03:51 continues to have sex
00:03:53 ok well he had several friends he didn't have
00:03:56 michael a  being gay marina bay and unique
00:04:00 these were my best friends but one
00:04:04 of my best friends was called michael he
00:04:06 was also an english boy he was also
00:04:09 an english boy to an english boy very
00:04:16 well well with michael and being gay with
00:04:19 other people we liked to watch movies  watch
00:04:23 movies or movies
00:04:27 exactly very well if we watched
00:04:29 movies every day but there was a
00:04:32 problem is that everyone michael me and
00:04:35 other friends lived in the
00:04:39 student residence
00:04:41 let's go they lived jce
00:04:44 did not live in a house he is an actor not a
00:04:47 house he lived is in an exact building  with a
00:04:51 lot of people with a lot of people all the
00:04:53 students students okay he is an actor from
00:04:56 the same university it was the
00:04:58 student residence they all went to the same
00:05:03 exact university between  once there we watched movies
00:05:06 together but the problem is that the
00:05:11 rooms the rooms where
00:05:13 we lived look smaller the
00:05:15 rooms rooms rooms
00:05:17 were very small
00:05:19 exactly normally we watched movies in
00:05:22 michael bay's room but he
00:05:24 only had two beds and a chair an
00:05:27 uncomfortable chair no  It was a comfortable chair
00:05:30 but it didn't make it a bit curved and
00:05:32 rustle in the room
00:05:35 Michael's room there was a bed is high the
00:05:40 bed
00:05:41 another bed
00:05:44 and a chair
00:05:47 and that's it and sometimes when
00:05:50 we watched movies no one
00:05:53 wanted to sit here  no one wanted to
00:05:56 sit in the chair everyone
00:05:59 wanted to be in bed because mom is
00:06:00 better because they are soft
00:06:03 long like damask more then
00:06:05 sometimes michael and I are in one
00:06:08 bed being gay and marina in another bed was a
00:06:11 bit  strange a little uncomfortable a little
00:06:14 strange really so very good well this was
00:06:17 the situation no then one day
00:06:20 one day any day it's
00:06:23 we were walking we were walking down the street
00:06:26 down the street yes
00:06:29 and we saw walking and exactly and we saw a
00:06:32 lot of furniture outside a lot of furniture on
00:06:35 the street for example tables for example
00:06:38 tables for example chairs and cabinets
00:06:44 different furniture on the street and there was
00:06:48 among the furniture there was an armchair  and an
00:06:51 armchair that doesn't look like an armchair but
00:06:53 more or less goes to an armchair worth a plane
00:06:58 armchair with an armchair that seemed comfortable
00:07:00 and was very cheap perhaps five euros
00:07:04 for something like that the furniture was on the
00:07:07 street but it wasn't abandoned then
00:07:10 there was no need to  pay exact money because
00:07:13 buy them
00:07:14 because a restaurant had closed a
00:07:18 restaurant in bali maybe they didn't make
00:07:21 money or maybe there were few people and they
00:07:23 decided it didn't close anymore we closed and they
00:07:27 sold all their furniture chairs their
00:07:30 tables so it was very very cheap maybe
00:07:33 five euros one thing yes  so we saw it we
00:07:36 said
00:07:37 we could buy the couch so
00:07:40 we can watch movies here more
00:07:43 comfortably so later we can watch
00:07:45 movies together  and you sit in the
00:07:47 mister to watch movies more comfortably it
00:07:51 's there no one no one will have to use the
00:07:54 chair exactly it's exactly
00:07:57 fine so we bought the
00:07:59 chair what's the problem we don't think
00:08:02 we don't think how to get the chair to
00:08:05 the badass residence we don't think  how to
00:08:08 take it from here to the residence of
00:08:11 the street of residence or do you
00:08:12 think we do not think about it we do not know how to do it
00:08:25 as willing to the truth

001,"00:00:00 Hello, in this video
00:00:03 I am going to talk to you about 5 things that we
00:00:11 Spaniards
00:00:13 don't do
00:00:18 [Music]
00:00:20 In this video I am going to talk about
00:00:25 some things that Spanish people
00:00:34 don't normally do
00:00:38 and the first thing that we Spaniards
00:00:44 don't normally do
00:00:46 is take off our shoes
00:00:51 take off our
00:00:54 shoes shoes when we
00:00:58 enter a house when we
00:01:03 enter a house we Spaniards do not
00:01:08 take off our shoes
00:01:13 very rarely it is very rare that you
00:01:19 arrive at a house and the person who is
00:01:25 there the person who receives you
00:01:30 asks you to take off your shoes  shoes is not
00:01:34 frequent it is very rare
00:01:37 normally people in spain walk
00:01:42 around the house with their shoes on in
00:01:48 spain the houses do not have a
00:01:54 carpeted floor there is no carpet on the floor of
00:02:00 the houses the houses have very
00:02:04 hard and very cold floors so no  It is normal to
00:02:12 take off your shoes when you enter
00:02:16 a house Another thing that is not normal One
00:02:21 thing that we Spaniards never do is
00:02:26 eat paella
00:02:29 eat paella
00:02:31 for dinner at night  At night no,
00:02:37 we Spaniards do not eat paella at
00:02:42 night, paella is not a dinner, it is not a
00:02:48 meal at night, it is a lunch, we
00:02:53 eat paella, we eat it at noon
00:02:57 around two or three in the afternoon,
00:03:03 we never eat paella at night.  There are
00:03:07 other
00:03:09 Spanish foods that we never eat at night,
00:03:15 for example,
00:03:16 lentils or stew are meals, they are
00:03:23 dishes for lunch but not for the
00:03:28 night, they are not dishes for dinner, they are
00:03:33 dishes for lunch, another thing that
00:03:38 we Spaniards do not do is queue to go up
00:03:44 to the bus
00:03:46 when we are going to get on a bus
00:03:52 we Spaniards do not queue
00:03:57 we do not keep an order to get on
00:04:03 people get on the bus without
00:04:08 keeping order without keeping order in
00:04:13 a totally
00:04:16 disordered way another thing that we Spaniards
00:04:21 never do is put the bread
00:04:27 on the  bread
00:04:29 on our plate on the plate where
00:04:35 we are eating
00:04:38 we don't put the bread on the plate no the bread
00:04:44 is put on the table on the table on the table
00:04:50 here next to the plate it is not put inside
00:04:56 the plate  or it is placed next to the plate on
00:05:00 the table bread is like a utensil in
00:05:06 Spanish food bread is a
00:05:12 utensil that helps us eat it
00:05:17 helps us push the food on the plate
00:05:22 that is why bread is placed on the table and not
00:05:27 inside the plate and also
00:05:30 we never put butter we
00:05:38 never put butter on bread no butter is not put
00:05:43 on food bread
00:05:46 and finally one thing that we Spaniards
00:05:52 do not do is

00:06:21 you can't call anyone
00:06:26 because it's disrespectful, you have
00:06:31 to respect the rest  of the people

00:01:55 money it costs 2  00 euros is worth 200 euros
00:02:02 but it is less less money than having to
00:02:06 buy tickets tickets tickets tickets
00:02:08 separately
00:02:10 very well and on this train what time of day
00:02:14 was it was a train trip at night a
00:02:18 trip at night a night trip
00:02:21 at night a  night trip they go to
00:02:24 sleep to sleep on the train while
00:02:28 you travel and you slept on the train I slept
00:02:32 little it
00:02:33 was a very old very old train from
00:02:37 a long time ago very old and very
00:02:39 uncomfortable it was very uncomfortable super uncomfortable
00:02:43 like this and there were a lot of people there was a lot to
00:02:47 It was full of people people and on the train on
00:02:53 the train you had a bed I didn't have a camera
00:02:57 I didn't have you didn't have how you didn't have a bed and
00:03:00 how you slept if you
00:03:03 didn't have you didn't have a seat you didn't have a seat I
00:03:07 couldn't sit on a chair or well a seat
00:03:11 you didn't have you didn't  The only thing it had was a
00:03:16 corridor there was a corridor we had a
00:03:18 latch on the train on the train there is the
00:03:20 window of the train this is the window
00:03:23 over here so they have to pass through the
00:03:25 trees okay and on the wall the corridor in
00:03:29 the corridor but not in the corridor
00:03:32 people pass by here that nothing to me
00:03:34 people walk here they walked ok on
00:03:37 the wall of the corridor there was a seat
00:03:40 that went down
00:03:43 ok
00:03:44 then it went down and there you can
00:03:48 sit here you sat very well  The
00:03:51 problem is that it is a very short corridor,
00:03:52 very narrow, the corridor is narrow and
00:03:56 you cannot have peace, not if there is one person
00:03:58 sitting, another cannot pass and you do not have
00:04:02 to when someone passes by and you will see that you have to
00:04:06 get up get
00:04:08 up and the other  person can pass
00:04:11 but you would get up at first I would get
00:04:16 up he would get up but then I got
00:04:19 tired and started to turn he would turn I
00:04:24 was sitting here and his feet came
00:04:28 out here let's show him
00:04:31 I'll walk by and you take me shingle and he would go
00:04:37 by very well  well

00:00:09 how the trains are inside and I
00:00:13 am also going to tell you what to do if you see
00:00:18 a very very handsome girl or boy
00:00:22 inside the train I will tell you what to
00:00:26 do
00:00:27 [Music]
00:00:32 hello in the previous video I told you about
00:00:38 the stations of the
00:00:43 train station of the train station and today I'm going to
00:00:46 talk about how the trains are inside
00:00:49 I told you that there are doors
00:00:53 and there are buttons on the doors there is a
00:00:58 button  you have to press for the
00:01:00 door to open because after the
00:01:05 door opens you have to wait
00:01:08 wait and let the people inside the
00:01:12 train get off
00:01:14 first they get off and then you
00:01:17 can get on yes sometimes there are
00:01:22 people
00:01:24 there are people who don't  It does this that is not
00:01:28 expected, it is not expected that people get off, they
00:01:32 try to get on and for themselves, but very few,
00:01:36 most of them do it well and it is expected, and
00:01:41 I also think that there are many friendly people,
00:01:44 if there is someone at the station, a
00:01:48 person with a cart  a
00:01:52 baby carriage  with a baby
00:01:56 yes yes there are always people who help
00:02:00 help lift the trolley to put it
00:02:04 on the train but as the baby starts
00:02:10 to cry
00:02:14 then everyone the same
00:02:17 people and I also want
00:02:21 to take the baby and  throw it throw it out
00:02:26 the windows the window to the window open
00:02:30 open the window and throw the baby take the
00:02:35 baby
00:02:37 or a bouncy castle uff and the
00:02:41 inside of the trains are dirty or
00:02:46 not clean normally they are
00:02:50 fine they are not they are not very
00:02:55 clean they are not a  a little dirty but not
00:02:58 very dirty because inside the trains
00:03:03 you can drink and you can eat it
00:03:06 is also allowed yes if it is
00:03:10 not prohibited it is not or it is not prohibited to eat or
00:03:15 drink no no it is not prohibited so it
00:03:20 is a little dirty but inside the train
00:03:25 there is  bins there are bins to throw away
00:03:30 to throw away the rubbish so it's good it
00:03:35 's clean it's good and also
00:03:38 most of the people are friendly and if they see
00:03:42 an old man or an old lady

370,"00:00:00 sometimes i see photos of barcelona
00:00:04 and i am surprised how different
00:00:08 barcelona was before how different it was in
00:00:11 the past so today we are going to see
00:00:15 old photos of barcelona
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:23 hello well we start with this photo of la
00:00:28 rambla la rambla which is sometimes called  la
00:00:32 rambla de las flores
00:00:35 if there are flowers they sell flowers they sell
00:00:38 plants this is a little different from
00:00:42 how it is now but it is still
00:00:46 a very important street a street where
00:00:49 there are many people where many
00:00:51 people go and in this photo we can already see that in
00:00:55 the past  I don't know if this was 100
00:00:59 years ago or so there were already a lot of people
00:01:02 there were a lot of people they had it's very
00:01:06 similar it's quite similar here we have
00:01:09 another photo and we see how well there are some
00:01:14 things that look alike they already had kiosks they
00:01:17 had stores where they sold newspapers
00:01:20 magazines and such  the buildings on
00:01:24 the sides are similar the shape of the
00:01:28 street where there is a walkway in the
00:01:31 middle and there are streets for cars on
00:01:34 the sides that's the same that's the same
00:01:38 now  a there is a very important difference,
00:01:40 that is why there were trams if you see the
00:01:45 trams that go by rail by
00:01:49 rail there are no tracks for the tram
00:01:52 now there are no trams on la rambla there are
00:01:56 trams in other places in barcelona
00:01:59 there are new trams but in la  boulevard
00:02:01 there are no trams anymore there are only cars we do not
00:02:05 see of course the old
00:02:08 cars but there were also horse-drawn carriages
00:02:11 here there were still horse-drawn carriages and
00:02:14 we are going to compare it with the boulevard
00:02:18 today and the boulevard today is like that
00:02:20 we continue to see that there is  shops the
00:02:24 shops are different now they sell
00:02:27 postcards they sell things for tourists
00:02:30 now there are many foreign tourists in
00:02:33 barcelona but apart from that it is very
00:02:36 similar there are still trees trees
00:02:40 on both sides to make shadows
00:02:43 especially in summer
00:02:46 the road has changed here before for  where the
00:02:50 cars go seems to be dirt it was like
00:02:53 dirt although here where they cross
00:02:57 pedestrians can cross and
00:02:59 also cross  The cars there I think there are
00:03:02 cobblestones I have seen in other photos that there
00:03:05 were cobblestones cobblestones are stones
00:03:07 it is not him instead of using asphalt it is a
00:03:12 floor made entirely of stones and the cars
00:03:15 go on that stone floor now not
00:03:17 now where do the pedestrians go  It's
00:03:21 all tiled and where the cars go
00:03:24 because it's asphalt like most
00:03:27 cities there are few streets I think in
00:03:31 cities especially in big cities
00:03:34 in Spain where there are cobblestones
00:03:36 next
00:03:38 this is the Mercado del Borne and the
00:03:42 market the market building still
00:03:45 exists  and in fact, before I lived here I
00:03:50 lived very close to this market and now
00:03:54 the market is a museum and in this museum
00:03:57 I saw I don't know if it was this photo or a photo very
00:04:01 similar to this one where you could see that they
00:04:04 brought all the food, vegetables and such
00:04:08 in wooden boxes in baskets in wooden baskets
00:04:11 and it was kind of
00:04:15 like this you don't learn much about
00:04:18 how people lived in the past
00:04:21 how they would shop and such today is
00:04:25 very different
00:04:27 this is the building the building is the
00:04:29 same but now it is not a market there
00:04:33 is still a lot of open space
00:04:36 in front of it in the past there already was but
00:04:39 now because it is not a market because
00:04:42 under the
00:04:45 market there are ruins i don't know if they are roman and
00:04:49 medieval ruins or  from what period but
00:04:52 ruins were found then the market
00:04:54 now the building still exists but
00:04:58 inside it is not a market but a
00:05:01 museum what is it do you know what
00:05:05 this is this is when they started building the
00:05:10 sagrada familia the church of the sagrada
00:05:13 familia i guess  You will know it is the
00:05:16 most famous tourist site
00:05:20 in Barcelona so something very
00:05:24 interesting is that when they began to
00:05:27 build the Sagrada Familia it was on
00:05:30 the outskirts it was outside the city
00:05:33 but today the city has grown
00:05:37 and swallowed up the Sagrada Familia and
00:05:40 Not many other things. In fact, I think that
00:05:44 when they began to build it,
00:05:47 this municipality was not Barcelona, ​​it was another
00:05:51 town that Barcelona later absorbed
00:05:53 into it.  In the same city today the
00:05:57 church is like that not all around it is the
00:06:02 city are buildings
00:06:06 and the Sagrada Familia have not
00:06:09 finished building it yet it is not
00:06:11 finished there is little left it seems that there are a
00:06:15 few years left until they finish
00:06:17 building it but the city has already grown
00:06:21 everything around it not following
00:06:25 the port this is the old port of
00:06:28 barcelona the port vell which today is
00:06:32 a marina is a port
00:06:36 where people with money rich people
00:06:39 have their boat they have their sailboat and
00:06:42 such and it is an area with
00:06:45 Shopping malls on the promenade and such in the past,
00:06:48 not in the past, they were really, it was
00:06:52 really the port where they brought
00:06:54 merchandise, where they sent and brought and
00:06:57 did trade, and there were also
00:07:00 warehouses.
00:07:06 All the merchandise was kept,
00:07:09 all the products, for later, well,
00:07:13 distribute the italo to take them away, not
00:07:15 today this same port
00:07:19 is this, you see the boats that there are the
00:07:22 most  of boats they are sailboats they are
00:07:26 boats recreational boats
00:07:28 and we can see all this promenade that they have
00:07:31 built in front that goes to the area an
00:07:34 area where there is a shopping center the
00:07:36 maremágnum is also the aquarium of
00:07:39 barcelona it is a rather tourist area
00:07:42 and the port of barcelona  Now it's
00:07:46 further south, it's further down, it's further
00:07:49 away from the city center because it
00:07:52 can be better connected to
00:07:55 big roads for big trucks to pass through
00:07:58 and not have to cross
00:08:00 the center of Barcelona and the port
00:08:05 is bigger now of course it's a lot
00:08:08 bigger than this one and this is the last photo
00:08:12 this is not a comparison between the
00:08:15 old photo and the new one it's just looking for
00:08:19 photos
00:08:20 and this and this seemed very interesting to me
00:08:23 what we see here well there are some children on
00:08:27 the street this is not what it seems to me
00:08:29 Interesting, what I find interesting
00:08:32 are these things that you see diagonally
00:08:35 like this, what was this good? This is to collect
00:08:41 light and to put light inside the house
00:08:45 in the center of the ba  rcelona in the old
00:08:48 town in the area what we call the
00:08:52 old city in barcelona there are very
00:08:55 narrow streets because for a long
00:08:58 time since a lot of people wanted to live
00:09:01 in the center of barcelona and there were
00:09:04 very narrow streets that it happens that
00:09:07 very little light enters there  very little light so they
00:09:10 had this thing that they opened and I
00:09:15 haven't found much information on the inside. I don't know if
00:09:18 it was a mirror inside or just
00:09:21 white so that it reflected light and
00:09:24 let light into the house and have more
00:09:27 natural light in the house without having to  spend
00:09:30 I don't know oil to light the
00:09:34 oil lamps and so then at least
00:09:37 during the day you could have a little
00:09:39 light inside the house despite the fact that the
00:09:42 streets were so so narrow it didn't
00:09:45 seem very interesting to me and well that's
00:09:48 it  the end of the video showing
00:09:51 old photos of barcelona is something very
00:09:55 interesting to see how people lived in
00:09:59 the same place where you live where you
00:10:02 have been not me now i don't live in
00:10:04 barcelona but i have lived  or several years
00:10:08 and if I find it very interesting and good,
00:10:10 I wanted to share it with you, okay,
00:10:13 bye-bye, and if you want to know the
00:10:19 best way to improve your Spanish, take a

00:00:05 Hello,
00:00:07 today I am going to tell you about the painter who painted
00:00:11 this painting
00:00:17 oysters, surely you have
00:00:20 heard of Picasso Picasso's name is Pablo, the
00:00:25 same as me,
00:00:27 Pablo Picasso, and in any case, he was born in 1881
00:00:40 in Malaga, Malaga, Malaga, Malaga, where he
00:00:44 is based in Malaga.  And if Picasso
00:00:51 had a father and a mother and his father was a
00:00:59 painter, he was a painter and perhaps he also
00:01:07 began to paint when he was very young and his father
00:01:13 saw how Picasso
00:01:18 painted as a child when he was 13 years old and when he was 13 years old he painted and his
00:01:25 father saw it and said I  I don't paint anymore
00:01:31 this child is now and has surpassed me
00:01:35 after
00:01:38 Picasso's family moved to Barcelona he moved to
00:01:45 Barcelona and in Barcelona
00:01:47 Picasso went to school an
00:01:51 art school but afterwards Picasso was very
00:01:57 bored at school they always did the
00:02:01 same  and case it was very original he
00:02:05 wanted to do very different things
00:02:06 at the age of 19 and case he went to
00:02:13 paris paris in france because
00:02:18 around the year 1900 paris was the center of
00:02:24 all art art in paris to the place where
00:02:28 where there were more
00:02:30 flames painters more of everything and picasso
00:02:35 when he went to paris he had no money he
00:02:40 had it and all his paintings his paintings
00:02:45 he had to burn he burned them because it
00:02:52 was very cold it was cold and he burned them
00:02:56 to be well what a heat because he
00:03:03 had no money and  when he had no money
00:03:08 his paintings were
00:03:13 all blue they were all painted blue all
00:03:20 blue blue but then picasso met
00:03:27 americans people from the united states
00:03:33 were in paris
00:03:36 picasso met and the americans either
00:03:42 liked picasso's paintings they
00:03:45 liked them and they gave him  money gave him the
00:03:49 money they bought and they told him picasso
00:03:52 more more more paintings we
00:03:56 bought ourselves we gave him money money money
00:03:59 then his paintings were already
00:04:05 happier with more colors with
00:04:07 red and green colors
00:04:12 but picasso still wanted more he
00:04:16 wanted something newer more different  more
00:04:20 different and he made a painting and painting we
00:04:25 give them when going to look at this painting
00:04:31 than all the people the people who saw it
00:04:36 from a chop chop  decades and a lot of people
00:04:43 didn't like it at all, but Picasso, yes,
00:04:47 I did, doing similar paintings, he made
00:04:52 a different style, cubism,
00:04:55 these paintings are tourism,
00:04:59 the case became rich, he earned a lot of money,
00:05:02 money, money, then in 1937, in Spain,
00:05:12 there was a war, the Civil War.  and there is
00:05:16 a town in the basque country the basque country
00:05:20 a town a town a place with houses
00:05:26 houses
00:05:28 this town is called Gernika and in
00:05:31 Gernika
00:05:32 there was a bombing bombing means
00:05:36 that planes are coming and Picasso painted a
00:05:51 very large painting by painting called
00:05:56 Gernika  the same
00:06:01 and this painting this painting is more or
00:06:05 less more than seven meters wide
00:06:12 and more or less three and a half meters high and very
00:06:18 large but in Spain when the
00:06:23 war ended it ended but the humans
00:06:27 won those who won the bad guys
00:06:30 then Spain and perhaps  The Gernika did not want it,
00:06:35 they wanted to send it to Spain and
00:06:40 perhaps it did not have it and they sent it to New York
00:06:46 in New York New York in the United States
00:06:53 There, the Museum of Modern Art, Moma,
00:06:57 and Gerni.  ka sent him there and from new
00:07:05 york he returned to spain with
00:07:11 democracy
00:07:12 now there is democracy more or less ice
00:07:17 in 1981 the guernica returned and is now
00:07:26 in the museum the reina sofía museum in
00:07:31 madrid
00:07:32 now the guernica is in madrid the

00:10:22 her heart, no, her mother's heart is
00:10:27 very bad, she is very weak, she is not strong, she
00:10:31 is very very weak like me
00:10:35 and they have to give her a transplant.
00:10:38 to change her heart, to have
00:10:44 a transplant, to change it, but of
00:10:48 course it will take a long time and
00:10:52 now we must not upset her, we must not
00:10:55 make her mother sad or cause suffering to
00:11:00 Estefanía's mother in another

143,"00:00:01 In this attempt
00:00:05 or do you know Christmas, do you really
00:00:13 know Santa Claus of course
00:00:22 because in Spain now Santa Claus brings
00:00:26 gifts
00:00:30 gifts to the children the boys and
00:00:33 girls extra gifts but not before
00:00:38 Santa Claus did not bring gifts to the children do
00:00:41 you think that the  children were sad
00:00:44 because no no no no because they had the
00:00:48 wise men' the wise men are three kings
00:00:53 one two three kings who also bring
00:00:58 gifts for the children the three
00:01:02 wise men well at night on the night
00:01:08 of the 5th
00:01:11 on the 5th of January  of January and on the 6th of
00:01:19 January
00:01:22 so when the children wake up
00:01:25 on the 6th they run to open the gifts
00:01:30 so now the children of Spain receive
00:01:35 gifts twice the gifts of Santa
00:01:38 Claus and the gifts of the three wise men
00:01:41 twice that you  It looks like kings
00:01:44 come from the east they
00:01:49 come from the east to bring gifts and they are
00:01:52 riding a camel
00:01:56 this is a camel and the three kings are
00:01:58 on three camels the kings are
00:02:03 melchor gaspar and baltasar melchor has
00:02:08 slightly white hair  similar to santa claus with a
00:02:12 beard
00:02:13 and mustache
00:02:15 gaspar has red hair
00:02:20 also with a mustache beard and baltasar is
00:02:25 black
00:02:28 and if the children are good the kings
00:02:32 bring gifts but if the children are
00:02:35 bad they bring them coal children do
00:02:40 n't like coal true but  They do like this
00:02:42 coal because it is coal
00:02:45 made of sugar to look like this the
00:02:50 children of Spain like it It is very sweet
00:02:54 on the 5th at night there is a parade
00:02:58 a parade takes place along the street and there are
00:03:03 floats the floats are like this
00:03:07 with wheels  and on top of that go the kings, for
00:03:13 example,
00:03:14 melchor, there are floats for the kings, there are
00:03:17 floats with gifts, all the gifts,
00:03:21 the gifts,
00:03:23 there are even floats
00:03:26 for coal, coal is also
00:03:31 in a float, the parades, there
00:03:33 are also here people
00:03:35 who throw candies,
00:03:39 candies for all the children.  the children
00:03:43 who have gone to watch a parade the
00:03:46 three wise men come from
00:03:50 the kings brought 33 gifts to the child to the
00:03:56 child jesus they
00:03:56 brought gold they
00:03:59 brought gold they brought incense  or incense
00:04:05 that smells good and they
00:04:11 brought [ __ ] I don't know what it is the truth is
00:04:13 that nobody nobody knows what [ __ ] is
00:04:15 but hey they brought three three gifts
00:04:18 three gifts for baby jesus
00:04:23 and you who like more
00:04:26 gifts or coal which one  which ones do you take
00:04:32 come bye

371,"00:00:00 Today I bring you
00:00:02 eight questions
00:00:04 8 puzzles for you to think about
00:00:10 how many to hit 'aces' hit 'aces' 0 out
00:00:15 of 8
00:00:17 and all eight out of eight
00:00:24 [Music]
00:00:27 hello, well, if you have to take paper,
00:00:34 paper and pencil and sign up,
00:00:38 sign up how many you have
00:00:43 guessed correctly, okay?  okay well the first one the
00:00:47 first I'm going to write a number
00:00:55 188 okay and this
00:00:59 188 you have to make a line a line
00:01:04 a line and with a line only a
00:01:11 line it's not two lines no no no with a
00:01:16 line
00:01:17 the
00:01:19 188 has to become
00:01:24 200 in 200 yes, how do we do it,
00:01:31 think about it, I'll leave you 5 seconds 1 2 3
00:01:38 4 5, well,
00:01:41 look at the solution,
00:01:45 that's how
00:01:49 we have converted
00:01:51 188 into 200, 100 and 200, if you
00:01:58 have succeeded or not,
00:02:01 we go with the next one on 2
00:02:06 and on the  second we have 10 coins
00:02:11 we have 10 10 coins and these coins
00:02:15 form a triangle right if a
00:02:20 triangle is worth then
00:02:23 moving three coins taking only
00:02:28 three three coins
00:02:30 we have to turn the triangle so here
00:02:35 the triangle points up and the
00:02:39 tria  angle has to point down
00:02:43 only with three moving moving
00:02:47 three coins yes
00:02:50 how we do it
00:02:52 come on I'll leave you again 5 seconds to
00:02:57 think
00:02:58 1 2 3 4 5 well you have to move these
00:03:07 coins the three coins in the corners
00:03:11 yes but you don't have to do  so no no they are not
00:03:17 put here no then this is a
00:03:21 coin two coins and three coins and
00:03:28 now the triangle is pointing downwards
00:03:32 with only three coins moving three
00:03:36 coins if you got it right or not
00:03:40 come number 3 this is also very
00:03:46 classic there are 9  dots
00:03:57 123456789
00:03:59 okay and we have to connect the dots
00:04:05 the dots the dots have to be
00:04:08 connected but we have to connect all
00:04:12 the dots the nine the nine dots
00:04:16 connect them but only with three
00:04:20 lines with three dashes yes and we can't
00:04:26 make three dashes for example here
00:04:29 we have nine no  we can't do three
00:04:32 lines one two three no it doesn't have to be
00:04:37 three lines
00:04:39 raise the marker or the pencil three
00:04:44 lines three lines for example like this one two
00:04:48 three
00:04:49 or one two three  s
00:04:53 three connected lines okay again I
00:04:58 'm going to leave you I'm going to give you five seconds
00:05:01 to think
00:05:03 one two three four five
00:05:10 okay what is the
00:05:14 solution well
00:05:15 we start to see the solution I'm going to do it with
00:05:18 black
00:05:20 we start in a corner and make
00:05:25 a line okay  I have not made a mistake there are
00:05:30 44 lines
00:05:32 I will let you think a little more if you
00:05:34 have not found it there are four lines okay
00:05:37 come on one two three four five okay well
00:05:43 it is a
00:05:46 2
00:05:48 3 and 4
00:05:51 yes and this is the solution yes yes very well
00:05:55 you have been right or not  this was a bit
00:05:59 more difficult
00:06:01 number 4 ok we have
00:06:05 this math problem 5 + 5 plus
00:06:14 5 equals
00:06:18 550 so this is wrong
00:06:22 clearly it's wrong because five plus
00:06:26 five plus five equals fifteen no yes
00:06:32 so here we have to change something
00:06:37 change one thing  for this to be
00:06:41 true for this equation to be true
00:06:47 that we have to change we have to
00:06:51 add a line a line a dash
00:06:56 only again only a dash
00:06:59 for this to be true what do we do
00:07:04 come come pe  nsar think 1 2 3 4 5
00:07:11 ok well look we can change this plus
00:07:16 with a line
00:07:19 it becomes a 4 if we have
00:07:24 545 + 5 it is equal to 550 yes it is true that is
00:07:33 correct this is very well you have succeeded
00:07:37 ok the number 5
00:07:41 the 5 I am going to draw  a bus ok it
00:07:48 has wheels
00:07:50 so this is a bus is it symmetrical
00:07:56 or not here it is symmetrical but
00:08:00 only by looking at this we can know if
00:08:05 the bus is going to go to the right
00:08:11 or to the
00:08:14 left or to the right yes yes yes  I
00:08:19 already know if in which direction the
00:08:24 bus goes in which direction it goes you know that
00:08:28 's it I've given you all the necessary information
00:08:34 come on I'm going to give you five seconds to
00:08:38 think one two three four
00:08:42 five well the solution depends
00:08:48 on your country yes  this is a track it is
00:08:54 an important track
00:08:56 so if in your country the cars
00:09:00 if the cars go on the right side
00:09:05 if the cars go on the right side or
00:09:08 if they go on the left side why
00:09:14 because on this bus you can't see the
00:09:18 door the door  for  entering to get on
00:09:22 the bus is not visible therefore the
00:09:26 door is behind it is on the other side of the
00:09:30 bus so this bus if this
00:09:35 were a Spanish bus the bus would go
00:09:39 to the left to the left if
00:09:43 the answer is if in your country you
00:09:47 drive on the  right side is that the
00:09:50 bus will go to the left
00:09:54 if in your country you drive on the
00:09:57 left side on the left side
00:10:00 then this bus will go to the
00:10:04 right it will go to the right
00:10:08 and this is the solution you have guessed
00:10:13 number 6 in number 6 we have  two
00:10:17 ropes two ropes if we have two
00:10:21 ropes and these ropes burn you can set
00:10:25 them on fire to set it on fire
00:10:29 and the fire is burning the rope
00:10:34 this rope takes an hour it
00:10:38 takes an hour to burn the
00:10:42 whole rope to burn and
00:10:47 we can't cut this rope I don't know  it can cut and
00:10:51 sometimes the rope some piece burns
00:10:57 burns fast another piece another part
00:11:00 burns more slowly ok we don't
00:11:04 know but we do know that the whole
00:11:09 rope burns  ema in one hour so with
00:11:13 these two strings both take one
00:11:17 hour one hour to burn
00:11:20 we have to count we have to count
00:11:24 45 minutes 45 minutes if 45 minutes not
00:11:31 of an hour then
00:11:35 45 minutes as we count
00:11:39 45 minutes with two strings that take
00:11:43 one hour to  burn
00:11:45 think think think come on five
00:11:49 seconds
00:11:51 one two three
00:11:53 four five of course if you want more
00:11:58 time to think you can pause you can
00:12:03 pause the video and think a bit better
00:12:08 this is a bit a bit difficult so
00:12:12 look at a track a track we can
00:12:16 turn on both sides  of the rope and
00:12:22 burn at both ends
00:12:25 then all the cream rope will burn
00:12:33 will burn in 30 minutes yes and so
00:12:38 we can count 30 minutes
00:12:42 but as we count the last 15
00:12:47 45 are 30
00:12:50 15 as we count the 15 minutes
00:12:57 come on I tell you the solution  Well, the
00:13:01 solution is that at the beginning we
00:13:06 light this end this end and
00:13:10 also this end this end of the
00:13:15 rope so
00:13:17 we wait until this
00:13:21 whole rope burns  until the rope
00:13:24 burns and all of them burn not
00:13:30 when it has burned 30 minutes have already passed
00:13:33 and here it is agreed
00:13:36 well a piece has
00:13:41 also burned 30 minutes of this rope have burned here too when
00:13:45 this rope ends when it burns  all
00:13:49 then we also set fire to this
00:13:53 end
00:13:54 because here there were still 30 minutes not
00:13:59 30 minutes but now there are two fires the
00:14:05 two ends of the rope are burning and
00:14:09 therefore this becomes 15 15
00:14:14 minutes 30 minutes plus 15 minutes and
00:14:18 we can count
00:14:19 45 minutes, yes,
00:14:23 what do you think, it was difficult or
00:14:27 you have not succeeded,
00:14:31 number seven, here we have a fish, it is a
00:14:36 fish made with toothpicks, with toothpicks,
00:14:40 no, so we
00:14:44 want this fish, this fish that is now looking to the
00:14:47 left,
00:14:48 we want  look to the right yes but
00:14:53 we can only move we can move
00:14:57 three chopsticks three chopsticks with three
00:15:02 chopsticks how do we make this fish look
00:15:07 to the right come again five
00:15:11 seconds to think 1 2 3 4 5 well
00:15:19 it's easy but it's a bit strange
00:15:25 because the most normal thing would be to think and here
00:15:30 is the head well I'll put the
00:15:33 head here it won't be one
00:15:40 23 or it didn't need 44 movements
00:15:45 yes then no it's not this  It's a little
00:15:50 different before the head was here and
00:15:55 now the head will be this yes so
00:15:59 with three movements it's one
00:16:07 2
00:16:09 and 3
00:16:12 yes and now we already have a fish that looks
00:16:16 to the right so the last
00:16:21 number 8 number 8 I think it's the  the most
00:16:25 interesting but it is also the most
00:16:29 difficult and there are four prisoners we have
00:16:36 four prisoners here there is a wall
00:16:41 there is a wall they cannot see through
00:16:45 the wall and then here is another other
00:16:50 prisoner
00:16:52 and then we have here two more so
00:16:56 there are four hats four hats
00:17:01 there  two white
00:17:05 white hats and two black hats
00:17:11 so they put hats on the prisoners
00:17:19 but they don't know what
00:17:23 color the hats they can't see are, for example  For example,
00:17:27 this prisoner sees the hat of this one and this prisoner sees
00:17:33 the hats of
00:17:37 these two
00:17:38 so two prisoners get
00:17:42 a white hat and two get
00:17:45 a black hat.
00:18:00 you have to say the
00:18:04 color of your hat of your own
00:18:07 hat any prisoner has to
00:18:11 guess his color
00:18:14 if a prisoner says my color is white
00:18:18 and he guesses he guesses right then the
00:18:23 four the four prisoners can
00:18:26 leave they can leave jail they can
00:18:29 go back home but  they don't know its
00:18:34 color this is black but it could be it
00:18:38 could be white and this was black
00:18:44 so how do the prisoners know how
00:18:49 can a prisoner tell the hat
00:18:54 his color the color the color of his
00:18:57 hat come on let you think again for
00:19:01 five seconds good  for this problem
00:19:04 you have to think more than five seconds
00:19:08 but again you
00:19:10 can pause pause the video ok 1 2
00:19:17 45 then  it is how this works ok I think
00:19:22 it is not very difficult what options are there
00:19:26 what possibilities are there for example that
00:19:29 this hat is white and these two are
00:19:34 black no if this prisoner sees two
00:19:39 black hats he already knows that his is
00:19:43 white because there are only two
00:19:46 black hats  if he sees two blacks he will say
00:19:50 and mine is white I know for sure
00:19:54 100% 100% sure my hat is white and
00:19:59 they all go home if this
00:20:03 prisoner sees two white hats he
00:20:07 also knows that his hat is black and he
00:20:12 says I have a hat  black and that's
00:20:15 it they go home what happens when these two
00:20:19 prisoners have hats
00:20:23 of different colors with different
00:20:28 colors one white one white and one
00:20:31 black no
00:20:33 then this prisoner doesn't know the
00:20:37 color of his hat he can't say anything he
00:20:41 doesn't say anything
00:20:43 what's wrong  then this
00:20:47 prisoner notices
00:20:49 the prisoner behind they don't say anything if
00:20:53 they don't say anything it means that my
00:20:57 hat and the hat in front are
00:21:01 different they have a different color
00:21:04 so yes  this is if this prisoner
00:21:07 doesn't hear anything and sees that the one in front has
00:21:12 a white hat he can say my
00:21:15 hat is black 100% sure and he
00:21:21 goes home they leave they don't all go and
00:21:25 vice versa well this would be black if the one
00:21:29 in front  it is black and this is white if
00:21:33 this prisoner does not hear anything and sees a
00:21:37 black hat he can say that
00:21:41 his hat is white my hat is
00:21:43 white for sure and that's it and the four of them
00:21:47 go home
00:21:49 and that's it
00:21:51 this is the last question the  last
00:21:55 enigma the last puzzle no and I hope
00:22:00 you liked it tell me and write in

00:01:02 fighting if one day david and
00:01:08 javier's father was not there he was gone
00:01:12 and they were at home
00:01:16 at home he was  his mother
00:01:20 his mother and the mother was cooking he

00:01:30 javier go outside go outside to the garden the
00:01:35 garden
00:01:38 there is no grass
00:01:41 there are trees

00:01:50 garden they went out to the garden
00:01:55 and they stayed for about half an hour
00:02:01 half an hour  outside in the garden half an hour
00:02:06 of time
00:02:08 and after half an hour the mother the
00:02:12 mother heard a noise and a noise of

376,"00:00:00 Did you know that penguin poop
00:00:04 makes you laugh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha?
00:00:09 Yes, well, in this
00:00:13 video I'm going to explain why
00:00:20 [Music]
00:00:23 Hello, well, if penguins
00:00:28 are birds, they are birds, but they can't fly, they don't
00:00:35 fly.  they can't fly and the first time
00:00:39 they saw penguins that someone that
00:00:44 a person that a person saw
00:00:47 penguins was on a ship on a ship and it
00:00:52 was a
00:00:53 portuguese ship from portugal yes and these
00:00:58 people who saw the penguin did not
00:01:01 say or a penguin no no  they called it a
00:01:05 penguin they called it a booby bird booby bird it
00:01:10 's like a silly bird not because it's
00:01:14 a bird what
00:01:17 knows how to fly it's a bird that walks
00:01:21 walks funny no and now
00:01:26 still some types some types of
00:01:31 penguins are called booby birds and
00:01:35 other types are called penguins
00:01:40 so penguins spend half their
00:01:44 lives half their lives on land and
00:01:49 half half or more more than half
00:01:55 their lives in the water swimming in the sea
00:02:00 then normally penguins for
00:02:04 behind behind they are black they are
00:02:09 black in color black and in front they
00:02:13 are white yes this is like a camouflage
00:02:19 a camouflage so that here in the water
00:02:23 so that in the water they look little the
00:02:28 same as some dolphins or
00:02:32 orcas some sharks too  in
00:02:36 front they are rather white and
00:02:41 behind rather black no then
00:02:44 there are also animals that eat
00:02:49 penguins yes above all killer whales killer
00:02:54 whales eat penguins
00:02:57 and leopard seals if leopard seals
00:03:00 also like they like to
00:03:04 eat penguins
00:03:07 then again  the penguins the
00:03:11 emperor penguin is the biggest penguin the
00:03:15 biggest of all and is the most famous
00:03:19 the one that most people know is the
00:03:22 emperor and then there is also the wind
00:03:27 and the wind is the one that swims the
00:03:31 fastest swimmer can swim at 36  kilometers
00:03:37 per hour is the fastest and in the
00:03:42 past long long long ago there were
00:03:46 bigger penguins yes there were
00:03:49 penguins there were penguins one hundred and
00:03:53 eighty 180 centimeters more or less c  As
00:03:58 I am tall, yes, and I weigh 80 kilos
00:04:03 80 kilograms, so have you
00:04:07 thought about what
00:04:12 penguins drink penguins drink from a glass they drink
00:04:17 from a bottle they drink water from a
00:04:21 bottle they don't drink water from a river no
00:04:28 penguins drink water  from the sea yes yes yes
00:04:33 sea water but sea water has a
00:04:36 lot of salt it has salt yes but
00:04:41 penguins can drink sea water
00:04:44 because they have a filter they have a filter
00:04:48 that enters
00:04:50 salt
00:04:53 water salt water and filters the salt yes yes yes
00:04:58 then  the mouth of a penguin have you
00:05:03 seen the inside of a penguin's mouth
00:05:07 look look
00:05:09 how scary how scary it looks like a monster
00:05:14 has thorns it has no thorns how
00:05:21 scary they have thorns on the tongue and
00:05:25 on the top of the palate so when
00:05:29 penguins both have an egg
00:05:32 penguins the male and the female take
00:05:38 care of the egg
00:05:40 except the emperor penguin in the
00:05:45 emperor penguin it is only the male
00:05:48 who takes care of the egg who takes care of the egg
00:05:52 then the emperor penguin the male
00:05:57 is  two months two months taking care of the
00:06:02 egg and does not eat no no the female
00:06:08 goes fishing to look for fish
00:06:12 and eat and the male two months in two
00:06:16 months does not eat he is only taking care
00:06:20 of the egg so all the penguins
00:06:24 live in colonies in colonies  in
00:06:28 large groups groups of many many
00:06:32 penguins do not live in very
00:06:35 large colonies some colonies of more than one hundred
00:06:40 thousand more than one hundred thousand more than one hundred thousand
00:06:43 penguins and sometimes when
00:06:47 a mother has a chick not when the
00:06:51 chick dies sometimes the  mother looks
00:06:55 for another chick another chick looks for a chick
00:06:59 and steals it and takes it she keeps
00:07:04 the chick but usually the
00:07:08 other mothers the other moms
00:07:12 get angry and protect the
00:07:16 babies
00:07:17 and now the time has come to talk
00:07:22 about poop  of course the poop to the poop I
00:07:27 really like to talk about the poop yes and
00:07:33 the penguin poop is
00:07:36 special so the groups of
00:07:39 penguins the penguin colonies are
00:07:43 very large and every day the
00:07:47 penguins poop  a and they spend several months
00:07:51 taking care of the egg and more months taking care
00:07:55 of the chick so they poop a lot
00:08:00 so imagine imagine the amount
00:08:04 of kaka there is then there is a
00:08:08 very interesting thing about poop is that
00:08:13 poop emits a gas it emits a gas that is
00:08:17 it's called nitrous
00:08:19 oxide nitrous oxide n2 you don't know it
00:08:24 's laughing gas yes it's a gas that
00:08:29 makes you laugh if you breathe ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha yes
00:08:33 yes then there was a group there were several
00:08:36 scientists who went to observe the
00:08:41 penguins and ended up  breathing this gas
00:08:47 they got intoxicated and couldn't stop laughing
00:08:51 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
00:08:53 yes yes yes and another thing the poop is
00:08:59 pink if it's pink because
00:09:03 penguins eat a lot of shrimp they eat
00:09:07 shrimp then the poop is pink  pink color
00:09:11 so the poop can be seen from space
00:09:15 from here from space you can see the
00:09:19 poop of the penguins if you look admire
00:09:24 what do you think do you like do you like the
00:09:29 penguins you find
00:09:31 the poop of the penguins interesting

144,"00:00:00 what is it
00:00:02 once upon a time a long long time ago

340,"00:00:01 mariah ha finally we have everything ready
00:00:06 let's play let's play a
00:00:10 game who's who
00:00:12 this game who's who I don't know if you
00:00:15 Maria had played when I was little
00:00:18 and not so little little so I'm
00:00:25 78
00:00:29 this is a version  Well, in English, in
00:00:32 Spain, this game is about who's who and
00:00:35 what. I think many of us, the majority of
00:00:38 Spaniards, have played since we were little
00:00:41 [Music]
00:00:46 so how does this game work?
00:00:56 show it to the
00:01:00 other person to show the camera
00:01:02 that sees it to the camera I have this person
00:01:05 and Maria has it is so
00:01:09 we put it here no
00:01:12 and we have to ask ourselves questions ask
00:01:16 questions and with the answers of the
00:01:19 other person then remove or eliminate
00:01:22 possible  Candidates
00:01:25 ok
00:01:27 start start you have to ask
00:01:30 yes or no of course it has to be
00:01:33 yes or no questions because you will always try to
00:01:35 eliminate well half the more
00:01:38 people the better
00:01:41 is a girl  a is not a girl
00:01:45 so now I have to slide down
00:01:51 the ones that are not girls I have not said that
00:01:56 it is not a girl so
00:01:58 you have to remove the girls you have to
00:02:01 hide the girls
00:02:04 well I'm asking you I'm
00:02:08 also come on it's a boy
00:02:11 it's a boy it's not a boy it's not a
00:02:14 boy that's very easy and you have to
00:02:16 look and see if it's true okay it's not a
00:02:18 boy okay then that's when all the
00:02:22 boys are
00:02:25 okay well well Maria has a woman okay that
00:02:28 's it all the girls are here  women come
00:02:31 ask ok pablo has a boy he
00:02:35 has black hair he does not have black hair
00:02:41 he is not a dark-skinned person
00:02:46 no no he is not a dark-skinned person
00:02:50 oysters well he is here and he eliminated many
00:02:53 many options I think I am going to win don't
00:02:58 come next  question is he a
00:03:02 dark-skinned person no he is not a
00:03:05 dark-skinned person
00:03:09 what can I ask here of
00:03:13 course whatever question I am going to
00:03:16 eliminate two or eliminate one I only have
00:03:18 three left I do not have three left three
00:03:20 options
00:03:22 wear a hat  rero
00:03:25 if you take a husband it's richter
00:03:32 which one is yours mine the fairy joseph
00:03:41 very well we play as we say in spain
00:03:47 I want the rematch of course the rematch and
00:03:50 after the rematch the tiebreaker
00:03:55 very well
00:03:56 well again up everyone I've
00:03:59 gotten nervous with  the questions because
00:04:02 many times when we say no it is not
00:04:06 a clear statement you do not have to
00:04:08 think if you want which ones you want to remove
00:04:11 and which ones to leave if you think do not bet
00:04:14 I have to remove no you do not
00:04:16 have to leave them very well then take a
00:04:19 card
00:04:21 and if you can  do anything you
00:04:27 would do in front of another person
00:04:32 we show them movies I have this
00:04:35 person and I have these people
00:04:38 well last time you started to
00:04:40 ask
00:04:44 okay
00:04:46 it's a woman yes okay okay well again I
00:04:51 have to hide the men from the
00:04:54 boys
00:04:57 this  It's a boy I hope you win if not
00:05:04 if not there won't be a tiebreaker okay okay
00:05:09 my question is
00:05:11 is it a dark-skinned person
00:05:15 when I say dark I mean
00:05:19 very dark and I mean  ro that includes very
00:05:23 dark and a little dark okay yes yes yes
00:05:28 yes it is a person with dark skin which in
00:05:30 this version of the game does not help you much
00:05:32 because more than half of the characters
00:05:35 are made of stones and well but if I had
00:05:38 had a person who  It is not because it already
00:05:40 eliminates many many options,
00:05:46 you have to leave those who are
00:05:48 dark-skinned white-skinned,
00:05:52 okay, okay, very well, wear your hair down
00:05:56 , yes, take it loose, yes, well,
00:06:00 I have to hide the ones with
00:06:03 ponytails, connect
00:06:06 correctly
00:06:08 [Music]
00:06:09 and  this one has like a headband if the
00:06:12 others have their hair down ok it
00:06:16 's a girl if it's a girl
00:06:20 it's not a man it's not a boy hide
00:06:23 the boys

00:05:59 come
00:06:03 and
",2
322,"00:00:00 How can I write write
00:00:05 numbers numbers 1 2 3 4 up to 16
00:00:15 numbers in a table and add
00:00:20 their sea
00:00:23 a number the same the same
00:00:30 number horizontally vertically and diagonally
00:00:39 the same the same number do you think it is
00:00:44 difficult well no no no today  I'm going to
00:00:50 explain I'm going to teach you how to solve
00:00:54 this
00:00:58 [Music]
00:01:00 oh well
00:01:02 yes I did this problem
00:01:09 in 1998 a long time ago when I was
00:01:19 at school and I think it was more or less late
00:01:24 maybe I don't know two hours more or less two
00:01:28 hours to solve this so I
00:01:35 thought let's
00:01:36 see let's see we have the table not the table
00:01:43 if I put 1 2 3 4
00:01:48 now the 2 is one plus one more not one plus
00:01:55 one more each time 111 well then I can
00:02:01 take the 16 the 15 not the  14 and each time they
00:02:09 are 1 - 1 - no good I'm going to put 16 15
00:02:18 14 in the same column okay okay 16 15
00:02:26 14
00:02:28 13 so 116 are 10 and 72 + 15 are 17
00:02:37 3 + 14 17 4 + 13 17
00:02:44 okay let's go okay no  we continue we continue
00:02:48 5
00:02:51 678
00:02:53 and here it is 13
00:02:57 12
00:02:59 11 10 9
00:03:03 very good no from 1 to 16
00:03:07 are all are all all the
00:03:10 numbers  Then one more is worth 5 6 6
00:03:17 6 12 18 18
00:03:21 16 44
00:03:26 44 if there are 48 12 12 9 21 21 13 'us 30
00:03:39 34 and 34 plus 13 34 is worth 34
00:03:47 and 34 very well the columns add up to 34 okay
00:03:55 then well x x is 34 no  if x is 34
00:04:02 but what happens that horizontally
00:04:07 horizontally not because 1234 are very
00:04:13 small 15 to 16 15 14 13 are very
00:04:18 large no so what can we
00:04:23 do here there are numbers big numbers
00:04:28 we have to move them have to
00:04:32 move
00:04:33 and up and numbers  no small numbers
00:04:39 have to go down so this
00:04:44 column this column and this column
00:04:49 we rotate them we rotate them and do like this these the
00:04:55 same these the same
00:04:59 and these we rotate them 16
00:05:04 12 51 and 13 9 84 very well let's add
00:05:14 let's add 16 plus 218 plus 3  21 13 34
00:05:22 and 34 12 618 more 7 25 more 9 30 and 45 more
00:05:32 10 16 26
00:05:36 and 34 very well one more 15 16 16 14 34 34
00:05:44 and these are the same because
00:05:48 we have not changed the columns no no 34 34 34 and
00:05:55 34
00:05:57 but  Now we have a problem because 16
00:06:04 6 32 42 and 16 plus 622 plus 10 32 436 the
00:06:15 diagonal is 36 and there is one plus 1  1 12 + 7
00:06:23 29 13 30
00:06:28 12
00:06:30 19
00:06:33 32 32
00:06:36 yes
00:06:39 then 36 has to go down 2 and 32 has
00:06:45 to go up 2 like how we do it how we
00:06:50 do
00:06:51 it well look at 36 we want it to go
00:06:57 down 2 we
00:07:00 can't change change the 6 for  the 5
00:07:06 and the 10 by the 9 and change them like this the 6
00:07:14 will go down 1 and the 10 will go down 1 and here
00:07:19 we will have 34 we will already have 34 or not
00:07:25 but there is a problem that here this
00:07:30 column will go up to one we will have 35
00:07:36 so what can we do
00:07:40 we can change  also the 12 for the 11
00:07:44 we change them here this go down to
00:07:49 1
00:07:50 we will have 34 again the
00:07:54 same in this column of 10 from 9 to 10 it
00:07:58 will go up one we will have 35 we can change
00:08:03 the 7 for the 8 and again we will have 34 and the
00:08:10 same the same for the  rows not
00:08:15 changing 5 by 6
00:08:16 we will have 33 will go down 1 changing
00:08:22 11 by 12 will go down 1 we will also have
00:08:26 32 but changing 10 by 9 will go up
00:08:32 1 and changing 8 by 7 will
00:08:36 go up will go up 1 at the end as we change them we
00:08:41 change them  all these columns are
00:08:46 simply changed are not changed
00:08:48 and there is a very good thing that we
00:08:55 change 11 to 12, 32 go up
00:08:59 to 1 and
00:09:02 7 we change it to 8 again it
00:09:06 will go up again we will have here also 34 let's
00:09:12 go see these rows remain the
00:09:15 same 16 23 13 and 1 15  14 4 and here
00:09:28 goes the 11 here the 5
00:09:31 here the 8 and the 10
00:09:35 here the 6 and the 12 here the 9 and here the 7 is
00:09:42 worth then these rows are the same the
00:09:46 same as before the
00:09:48 same as here we already know that 34
00:09:52 is also 34
00:09:56 very well this row the numbers are the
00:10:00 same the same numbers as in this
00:10:03 that in this row not 11 yes 5 and 8
00:10:08 and 10 yes and we already know that it gives 34
00:10:14 therefore 34 this row equals 6
00:10:19 and 12  if 9 if 7 and 34 the same
00:10:26 now the columns
00:10:29 16 11 27 plus 6 33 1 34 257 plus 12 19 plus
00:10:42 15 34 38 11 plus 9 20 plus 14 34 13 10 23
00:10:53 7 34 34 and now the moment of truth
00:11:00 the diagonals 11 12  13 + 8 21 13 34
00:11:12 16 5 21 9 34 34 if this is the solution
00:11:23 this is the solution no
00:11:26 yes yes that's it we are done
00:11:32 as you can see we have changed these four
00:11:36 numbers from 6 to 5 from 1  0 to 9 have
00:11:42 gone down 2 and from 11 to 12 and from 7 to 8 they have
00:11:47 gone up 2 but the rows and
00:11:52 columns have remained the same as before and
00:11:56 this is a solution there are many
00:11:59 solutions we can also rotate this
00:12:04 so it is also a  solution turn it like this
00:12:07 also turn it around like that turn it
00:12:11 around like that turn it around and turn it
00:12:15 all are solutions they all add up to 34
00:12:20 I hope you liked that you like
00:12:24 that you like these problems if
00:12:28 you know of a problem a

00:04:22 every day every day we took the
00:04:26 bus we went to see things in
00:04:30 France but one thing that is
00:04:33 always done in the colonies every time
00:04:37 every year every year  the colonies are made they
00:04:39 are the games at night games that are
00:04:44 made at night at night games are made

00:05:10 flashlight with batteries
00:05:14 not with batteries positive or negative or
00:05:16 positive or negative and that illuminates
00:05:21 the children go searching or they go looking for
00:05:23 things

00:00:44 roll more or less like this it is not on
00:00:50 top of the window but no you cannot see
00:00:55 a roll here
00:00:57 you cannot see it because it is inside the wall
00:01:02 for example in a house
00:01:06 the wall is not a wall a wall and  here is
00:01:11 the window and here is the blind there is
00:01:16 the roll that goes up and down
00:01:19 the blind is made of plastic it's
00:01:23 like this made of plastic
00:01:26 there is a strap there well here a strap
00:01:33 or here a strap and with this strap
00:01:37 you can raise or lower the blind
00:01:42 yes  you pull if you pull the strap the
00:01:46 blind goes up and if you let go if you let go of the
00:01:52 strap the blind goes down and one thing that
00:01:58 's great about the blind is that if you
00:02:03 pull it down
00:02:06 and the blind goes down
00:02:10 you can make the whole room the whole
00:02:14 room dark  be all
00:02:17 dark yes then even if it's sunny
00:02:23 even if it's sunny even if it's day
00:02:28 it's I don't know eleven
00:02:32 or four in the afternoon you can sleep
00:02:36 you can sleep because it's dark in your room it
00:02:39 's all dark you can't see
00:02:44 anything
00:02:45 so you can sleep you can
00:02:49 sleep late  until 11 for example
00:02:53 you can watch a movie with a projector
00:02:57 with a projector you can watch a movie
00:03:01 even if it's during the day even if it's during the
00:03:04 day or you can record you can record a
00:03:08 dreaming spanish video at any
00:03:12 time at any time of the
00:03:15 day the  The blinds are great but
00:03:20 in most countries they don't exist in many
00:03:25 countries in northern Europe they don't exist in the
00:03:28 US in America they don't exist in Asia no
00:03:33 why why
00:03:36 I don't understand oh and another thing the
00:03:40 blinds have holes the blind
00:03:45 here has  holes holes yes then
00:03:52 those holes when you raise or lower the
00:03:57 blind the holes you can open them
00:04:01 or you can close them and if you open them
00:04:05 a little light enters the light enters the light enters
00:04:10 no p  But the most important thing is that
00:04:15 air
00:04:17 enters, air from outside enters,
00:04:20 so there are holes, so in summer
00:04:25 when it is hot, in summer,
00:04:29 the light does not enter, the light does not enter,
00:04:33 but the air does,
00:04:35 the air does enter, so it is not
00:04:39 hot,
00:04:40 because these blinds are a bit
00:04:44 different because they work with an
00:04:49 electric motor there is no belt
00:04:51 here there is no belt there are buttons to
00:04:55 lower
00:05:01 and to raise
00:05:09 and as you can see the blind is outside it is
00:05:14 outside the window and there are holes
00:05:19 there are holes that can be open
00:05:23 but can also be closed
00:05:30 and here they are  He turned off the light because the
00:05:35 room is completely dark,
00:05:38 totally dark, although it is daytime
00:05:42 outside, it is daytime.
00:05:47 This type of blind is the most normal,
00:05:51 the most common, the most common in Spain,
00:05:55 which has a strap. You have a strap and
00:06:00 you have to
00:06:04 release it to lower the  blind and pull
00:06:10 to raise the blind you have to use
00:06:13 force and well no you don't get tired you
00:06:19 don't have to use a lot of force and it's
00:06:21 faster than with the buttons but good  It's not
00:06:27 more for the poor, not for people like me who don't
00:06:32 have money, nothing is true.
00:06:34 Most of the blinds in Spain are
00:06:38 manual, they work with a
00:06:40 strap,
00:06:41 so if you come to Spain,
00:06:45 remember to remember to use the
00:06:48 blinds, remember that you have to  pull
00:06:52 to go up and drop
00:06:57 to go down okay and tell me tell me in
00:07:02 your country that you have blinds
00:07:06 or you have curtains only curtains or
00:07:10 that you have to write it below in the
00:07:13 comments
00:07:14 okay and if you like it

00:00:02 today is sunday and last thursday
00:00:10 was march 30 of this year 2017 on the
00:00:18 30th
00:00:20 me pablo pablo and my my friend my friend
00:00:28 luz
00:00:30 we went to a gym a gym is a
00:00:35 place where people do exercises
00:00:38 do push ups do
00:00:42 sit ups but this  The gym is not a
00:00:46 normal gym, it's a different gym, it
00:00:50 's a gym where people go
00:00:54 climbing, look, look, we went to this
00:00:58 gym, it
00:01:00 's a gym that you have to pay to
00:01:04 use once a day, all day
00:01:08 30, you have to pay ten euros, ten  euros and
00:01:14 to climb they wear shoes they wear
00:01:19 special shoes they are not these shoes they
00:01:22 are shoes like
00:01:27 that I don't have those shoes so for
00:01:33 one day to be able to wear shoes you have to
00:01:38 pay
00:01:39 three euros it
00:01:42 's ok it's not it's not very expensive these
00:01:45 these shoes are called  cat feet the cat's
00:01:49 feet are very tight to the foot
00:01:53 this is the foot and the cat's feet are
00:01:57 very very tight
00:02:02 the fingers that are squeezed to make
00:02:07 it easier when going up it is better when going up the
00:02:12 gym is very big  where there was a wall
00:02:20 here a
00:02:22 long wall to be able to climb and here another wall
00:02:27 also very long and in the middle there were two
00:02:30 islands like this more or less with this shape and
00:02:35 here too and here you could
00:02:39 climb here here and here and
00:02:41 behind  in front of the side
00:02:43 behind here there was everything of prey
00:02:48 prey is similar to a stone that
00:02:52 you can grab to climb so here
00:02:56 there were prey prey pierre
00:02:58 prey here too and here
00:03:01 also here I could go up
00:03:05 and underneath this is soft like this  if you are
00:03:12 climbing and oh and you fall if it is soft
00:03:18 and no you do not hurt yourself then all this
00:03:21 is mattress mattress mattress all
00:03:24 mattresses all soft mattresses and there is
00:03:29 a bit of a higher wall also
00:03:34 here compresses
00:03:36 and if you want to climb a person to
00:03:40 climb with  rope to rope
00:03:45 there is a higher wall but these
00:03:47 walls wall wall are shorter and
00:03:51 rope is not needed although there is no agreement
00:03:54 nothing happens many of the walls
00:03:58 were inclined to be  calar they were
00:04:03 leaning leaning back
00:04:06 so it's very difficult I'm not I'm not
00:04:11 very good at climbing for me it's better a
00:04:15 straight wall or a little bit forward
00:04:19 better still easier
00:04:23 so there was a little bit of a wall
00:04:26 of wall that was straight and I was
00:04:30 climbing in this area here and a
00:04:33 little around here was one it was very fun
00:04:38 I liked I liked climbing all the
00:04:44 people the people who were climbing the
00:04:47 majority were people from Catalonia
00:04:51 there weren't many
00:04:54 foreigners

00:00:05 hello soul
00:00:09 hello do you like snails
00:00:15 not much I don't know what it means
00:00:19 I like I like to see them I like to
00:00:24 eat them of course because there are people who
00:00:29 eat snails not like that in Spain there are
00:00:34 people who eat snails in Spain
00:00:37 we eat snails
00:00:38 Yes, well, there are many many people,
00:00:43 not many people who are
00:00:48 disgusted by snails, they see them and say oh
00:00:52 how disgusting, but I think they
00:00:57 are very interesting, they are a very interesting animal,
00:01:04 so
00:01:06 I hope that today you will tell me why
00:01:10 why they are  interesting because I don't know
00:01:16 how a snail can be interesting well
00:01:21 look today I'm going to tell you everything
00:01:26 well I think that everyone
00:01:31 everyone knows that snails carry their
00:01:34 house on their backs they don't carry their house
00:01:39 but soul you know why  the shell of
00:01:45 the snails is a spiral because it is
00:01:49 a spiral you know it no I don't know I don't
00:01:53 know why it is a spiral because it is not
00:01:57 a spiral to be able to grow when
00:02:00 the snail grows the shell does not grow  ce
00:02:05 does not get bigger the shell is
00:02:10 spreading it is becoming like this
00:02:15 the spiral is growing not the
00:02:19 more turns
00:02:22 the shell is that the snail has lived
00:02:26 longer
00:02:29 if it is interesting I did not know it is a
00:02:34 way to make your house can go
00:02:36 growing
00:02:38 and your house adapts to your body yes
00:02:43 exactly and then look at the snails look
00:02:48 I'm going to make you here another
00:02:51 larger snail the snails have four
00:02:54 tentacles
00:02:56 tentacles
00:02:58 are 12
00:03:01 3 and 4 so they have 2
00:03:07 short tentacles two short ones below these tentacles
00:03:11 are for him  touch not for touch but
00:03:17 also for taste snails
00:03:21 can
00:03:22 can feel the flavors of things
00:03:26 they touch and they have two long tentacles on
00:03:30 top no and yes they have eyes here but
00:03:36 snails' eyes are very bad they
00:03:40 see very bad in fact no  come see if there is
00:03:47 light or there is darkness but they don't see like
00:03:53 we don't see what's there
00:03:56 but with these tentacles they can also
00:04:00 smell they
00:04:03 can smell and they can smell food
00:04:07 from a long distance a lot of di  distance
00:04:12 then the short tentacles are to
00:04:17 touch and to taste and the
00:04:23 long tentacles are to see and to smell
00:04:29 what a strange thing if it is strange
00:04:34 not as I have told you with the tentacles it
00:04:37 can smell at a great distance
00:04:43 how far away do you think they can
00:04:47 smell
00:04:48 you can't smell
00:04:55 3 meters is more or less more or less it
00:05:00 goes that way the thing is a lot of distance
00:05:04 but well in the end things maybe and three
00:05:07 meters I don't know five meters something so of
00:05:13 course it's not a long distance but for a
00:05:17 snail it's a lot  because the snail goes
00:05:21 very slowly
00:05:24 and a snail takes a long time to
00:05:27 travel 3 meters it
00:05:31 goes slower even than a
00:05:38 turtle turtles go faster
00:05:41 than snails yes and another curious thing
00:05:46 is that snails don't hear they don't hear
00:05:51 anything
00:05:52 they don't have a sense of hearing  It's funny they
00:05:57 don't have ears they don't have ears
00:06:00 and you know you know how I
00:06:03 know how how you know
00:06:06 because I spoke to a snail and
00:06:08 said hello but it didn't answer me so
00:06:12 clearly they don't hear anything they don't hear I don't know
00:06:17 maybe that snail didn't speak Spanish
00:06:21 ha ha ha of course I hadn't thought about that
00:06:25 maybe it was a French snail it's possible it
00:06:30 's possible of course I didn't say it bonjour and he
00:06:34 didn't answer me he didn't understand you no how
00:06:38 smart you are soul yes
00:06:42 another interesting thing
00:06:44 is that the  snails
00:06:48 they do have a mouth let's see
00:06:50 where the mouth is I think the mouth is
00:06:52 around here they have a mouth but not that they
00:06:56 don't have teeth or rather they don't have
00:07:00 teeth like ours that chew
00:07:03 they chew food but they have
00:07:08 teeth in the tongue
00:07:12 in  the tongue yes they have a tongue with
00:07:17 teeth with a lot of teeth
00:07:21 i cant imagine something like that no instead of
00:07:27 chewing the food what they do is good
00:07:32 the mix but its a bit like scratching the
00:07:35 they are not scratching the food
00:07:39 like a cheese grater like ryan or
00:07:43 something like if stripes is the cheese for
00:07:46 the pizza or for the basta and the
00:07:50 most interesting thing here about the
00:07:55 snails is how they reproduce as they
00:08:00 are born well their babies not how
00:08:04 snails reproduce because well
00:08:09 s  Surely you already know that
00:08:12 snails are hermaphrodites
00:08:16 and hermaphrodites
00:08:17 yes what does hermaphrodite mean
00:08:21 exactly does it mean that a snail
00:08:25 is male and female it is both
00:08:32 yes
00:08:34 then if it is both male and
00:08:37 female no
00:08:40 but it is very interesting because you say
00:08:44 well man as both  man and
00:08:46 woman when two snails meet
00:08:50 and they like each other, not if they like
00:08:56 each other, well, the snails copulate, no, and they
00:09:00 will both be mothers, but it is not so easy
00:09:08 because the two snails want to
00:09:12 be a father, but they do not want to be a mother,
00:09:17 they both want  being a dad but no one
00:09:20 wants to be a mom no because being a mom is a
00:09:24 lot of work
00:09:26 you get tired
00:09:29 what is the difference between the dad of
00:09:33 the snails and the mom what is the
00:09:37 difference the
00:09:39 good dad the two snails are the same
00:09:43 but when you are the mom you are
00:09:46 pregnant
00:09:48 In the case of snails, they
00:09:51 lay eggs, they don't lay eggs, so
00:09:54 to lay eggs you have to eat
00:09:57 eat a lot, you have to get tired, but
00:10:02 to be a father, not to be a father, you look
00:10:06 for a snail, you put your DNA,
00:10:10 your genetic code, your seed, your semen,
00:10:14 and then you look for another for cabbage and
00:10:18 again and then another snail, you can be a
00:10:19 father many times,
00:10:22 but it can only be  mummy well
00:10:25 once and then you have to wait to lay
00:10:28 the eggs and such to be able to come back
00:10:30 so all the snails
00:10:34 want to be dad they don't want to be mom
00:10:38 and how do they decide who is the dad and who
00:10:43 is the mom in the end like how do they decide
00:10:47 that what  they make a fight with a knife with a
00:10:52 knife
00:10:54 if it's more or less like a
00:10:57 fight then well they really call it
00:11:01 giving it okay but if you see if you see a photo it
00:11:06 looks more like a knife and it's that
00:11:09 each snail tries to nail the other
00:11:14 with its consulate  okay
00:11:18 and
00:11:19 if he succeeds if he succeeds then he ends up
00:11:22 with the dart stuck here then this
00:11:27 dart you will think of that dart it has the
00:11:30 semen it does not have it it has the
00:11:32 spermatozoa no well no not
00:11:36 exactly
00:11:37 after this fight
00:11:42 after l  to fight
00:11:44 the two snails well they reproduce or
00:11:47 they pass I don't know how they hug each other
00:11:50 and pass the semen the sperm are passed
00:11:55 but the body of the snail fight
00:12:01 fight tries to kill the
00:12:05 sperm
00:12:08 and this this knife this dart
00:12:14 has some hormones some hormones  that
00:12:17 protect the spermatozoa
00:12:23 if then if they have stuck the
00:12:27 dart into you you will surely get pregnant
00:12:31 and if you managed not to get stuck in the
00:12:35 dart you will surely not get pregnant
00:12:40 very interesting I swear that
00:12:44 many times well both both
00:12:46 lose or both get  they nail and they both end up
00:12:49 pregnant but well
00:12:53 very strange very strange very strange 6
00:12:59 but the thing doesn't end here
00:13:02 are the eggs not once a
00:13:07 snail gets pregnant then lays the
00:13:09 eggs in the eggs well there are the oscar
00:13:12 acolytes the baby snails and when  a
00:13:16 snail comes out of the egg when it
00:13:19 hatches the snail eats the shell of
00:13:25 the egg the empty egg the egg from which
00:13:28 the shell has hatched eats it yes p  because
00:13:34 the shell has calcium
00:13:37 if the calcium is good for the shell
00:13:41 for its shell it
00:13:44 is very curious it is very strange and you know
00:13:48 that there are there are creams there are
00:13:54 cosmetic products that are made with snails
00:14:00 with snail slime
00:14:02 with
00:14:03 slime xxi with products for  the skin and
00:14:07 such I don't know if cosmetic is to
00:14:11 regenerate
00:14:13 the skin
00:14:15 because there is something in the snail slime
00:14:19 that regenerates and when I believe you I think that
00:14:25 when a snail breaks its shell it
00:14:28 can regenerate regenerate that shell no
00:14:32 yes well
00:14:33 look what  does the baby snail do
00:14:37 after eating the shell of the
00:14:41 egg sometimes it eats the other eggs its
00:14:46 siblings
00:14:49 if it eats the eggs that are still
00:14:53 in the snail inside if it eats on
00:14:56 Thursday the eggs that haven't
00:14:59 hatched yet the snail hasn't hatched  The snail
00:15:02 inside eats them and cruel is
00:15:07 cannibalism
00:15:09 yes yes then of course
00:15:13 the snails have the slime not the
00:15:17 snail slime they are very humid they are
00:15:19 wet and they need that to move
00:15:23 the snails do not change  inan they have to
00:15:26 crawl
00:15:28 and this slime helps them move
00:15:32 so they need to be in a place with a
00:15:37 lot of water
00:15:39 maybe it hasn't rained or something that
00:15:43 is wet
00:15:44 and already makes a lot of water
00:15:48 what happens when there is no water what
00:15:51 do you think happens they die well  no no
00:15:55 snails do not die so easily
00:15:58 when there is no water when there is no water their
00:16:05 slime dries up all the slime does not go away I am going to
00:16:10 make all the slime here the
00:16:12 snail slime dries up so when the snail
00:16:16 dries the slime becomes hard  it gets
00:16:20 hard and this makes a bit like a
00:16:24 lid makes a lid
00:16:27 and then around here it doesn't dry anymore the snail doesn't dry anymore well
00:16:36 it conserves its water it conserves
00:16:39 all the water it has inside the
00:16:42 shell
00:16:43 so the snail can wait  it can
00:16:47 wait a long long time
00:16:49 wait for it to rain again when
00:16:52 it rains again then it gets wet and it can
00:16:57 come back it can go out again it can go back
00:17:00 to look for food and maybe
00:17:03 you know pablo I understand why when
00:17:08 I was little and I found  snails
00:17:12 because after it rained when it was
00:17:16 dry there were snail shells because in the
00:17:21 street or anywhere I remember
00:17:24 that when I was little and I saw
00:17:27 small snail shells
00:17:30 I liked to step on them if I stepped on the
00:17:35 shells and inside and inside there
00:17:40 were always  water was always wet if I
00:17:44 have the memory now the snail
00:17:47 if the snail was still inside no
00:17:51 the shell was not empty if I think
00:17:54 on the sabbath that it was dead already yes yes
00:17:59 poor snails
00:18:01 how many how many snails would you kill demands well
00:18:05 yes and as you have said before  in
00:18:08 spain' in spain we eat snails your
00:18:13 soul have tried them have you eaten
00:18:15 snails no i have never tried
00:18:18 snails no because i have never been in
00:18:23 a bar where well i have never asked
00:18:27 for snails for myself and i have never eaten with
00:18:31 people who
00:18:32 were eating snails
00:18:35 so never  I have tried them and you
00:18:39 have tried them if I like them I
00:18:43 like them a lot Sometimes when I was
00:18:46 little I would ask for them in the restaurant and
00:18:49 eat caraco  They were at the restaurant and my
00:18:53 grandmother, my mother's mother, made
00:18:56 snails, she cooked snails, she made
00:18:58 snails with tomato and
00:19:04 tomato sauce, they were very good.
00:19:27 you eat it it's like chicken meat it's
00:19:30 like it's like a it's like shellfish like
00:19:35 clams it's very similar to shellfish
00:19:39 similar to
00:19:43 clams clams you
00:19:46 haven't tried snails
00:19:51 I think you haven't tried to see what a snail would be like
00:19:56 a snail is  similar to a snail
00:19:59 but they are in the sea they
00:20:03 are in the sea you have never tried
00:20:05 snails I don't think it's not worth it well
00:20:09 yes it is very it is very similar it
00:20:13 is yes to clams the taste is the
00:20:16 texture above all it is similar they are so
00:20:20 good
00:20:22 there  a type of snail there is a snail in
00:20:27 africa that is the largest in the world
00:20:33 that is up to 30 centimeters about 30
00:20:38 centimeters
00:20:40 I think you could try eating
00:20:44 this one
00:20:45 to start with  fish if a good
00:20:49 30 centimeter snail is
00:20:54 light
00:20:56 what
00:21:01 nutritional properties do snails
00:21:04 have they have a lot of protein they have a lot of
00:21:08 vitamins
00:21:09 that snails have snails
00:21:13 have a lot of water a lot of water
00:21:18 although of course when you cook them well you won't
00:21:22 have meat in the end above all they will be
00:21:28 good zinc proteins  well soul I hope you have
00:21:31 learned something interesting about
00:21:34 snails yes many things I knew
00:21:38 practically nothing about snails
00:21:41 now I am very informed very well I
00:21:46 am glad and see you in the next video
00:21:49 okay here

196,"00:00:00 do you know the aztecs the aztecs
00:00:06 lived in mexico it
00:00:09 was an ancient civilization in mexico and
00:00:14 for a long time
00:00:19 corn corn was their most important food it was
00:00:25 what they ate the most
00:00:28 but today i am going to explain the legend of
00:00:32 how they got corn because before
00:00:36 before  they didn't have corn and then they
00:00:41 got it right we have corn and this
00:00:44 legend explains how they
00:00:47 got corn
00:00:50 [Music] you
00:00:57 know quetzalcóatl
00:01:00 quetzalcóatl is a god a god of the
00:01:06 Aztecs he
00:01:08 is a god who is a snake a
00:01:13 snake yes yes
00:01:15 and this legend  It says that before
00:01:20 Quetzalcoatl came there was no corn and
00:01:26 the Aztecs the people
00:01:31 didn't the Aztec people ate only
00:01:36 animals and fruits they only didn't eat
00:01:43 corn and once the Aztecs were very
00:01:49 hungry they were very hungry they
00:01:53 wanted to eat but they had no food they
00:01:56 were hungry
00:01:59 and  they had heard they had heard of
00:02:03 corn
00:02:05 but the corn was behind mountains
00:02:10 of
00:02:15 mountains very big mountains and they could
00:02:19 n't pass no  they couldn't then the Aztecs
00:02:23 asked the gods for help they asked them for
00:02:28 help help us help us we are
00:02:32 very hungry
00:02:35 and the gods began to think
00:02:39 of ways to get corn for the Aztecs
00:02:45 and a god tried to move the
00:02:51 mountains but he couldn't
00:02:54 have a lot of strength but  He could not
00:02:58 move the mountains and another god tried to
00:03:03 destroy the mountains but
00:03:08 he did not succeed either no no and of
00:03:12 all the gods of all the gods
00:03:15 none managed to bring the corn so
00:03:21 they asked the god quetzalcóatl and
00:03:25 quetzalcóatl said okay I will bring you the
00:03:31 maize wait wait
00:03:34 and the Aztecs waited they waited they
00:03:39 were very patient because they were
00:03:44 hungry yes yes but they waited this is how about
00:03:49 4
00:03:52 and after thinking thinking for a long
00:03:56 time
00:03:58 quetzalcóatl became an ant an
00:04:02 ant became
00:04:08 an ant and quetzalcóatl became a
00:04:14 friend  of a red ant a red ant of
00:04:19 red color
00:04:23 and the ants became friends and  they
00:04:27 went they went to the anthill they went to the
00:04:33 anthill to the red ants anthill
00:04:37 here there were ants ants ants
00:04:40 ants and they went to the anthill but the
00:04:45 ants
00:04:47 did not trust quetzalcóatl
00:04:51 very much and it took a long time for the
00:04:55 ants to trust him and become
00:04:59 friends and  then quetzalcóatl
00:05:05 asked them what was the way which
00:05:10 was the way the way to cross to
00:05:15 cross the mountains
00:05:19 and the red ants told them
00:05:22 you have to go here and here and
00:05:25 there they told him the way then
00:05:29 quetzalcóatl with his friend  the red ant
00:05:35 the two of them went on a trip along the road
00:05:42 and the road the road was
00:05:49 very difficult very
00:05:52 tired there was a lot of danger a lot of danger
00:05:58 but he continued he continued he continued and they
00:06:02 reached the other side where there was corn
00:06:07 corn corn corn
00:06:11 and quetzalcoatl took a  grain a grain
00:06:16 of corn
00:06:17 a grain of corn he took it and took it
00:06:22 back brought it
00:06:25 back and gave it to the Aztecs
00:06:30 and the Aztecs and the  Aztecs took the
00:06:35 grain they planted it they didn't plant it here
00:06:41 they irrigated it with water
00:06:45 with water they irrigated it
00:06:48 and managed to grow corn they
00:06:51 managed to grow corn and thanks
00:06:57 thanks to corn
00:06:59 the Aztecs got more money
00:07:04 more wealth not more money more power they
00:07:10 managed to make cities
00:07:14 cities and that's why  the aztecs revere
00:07:20 revere quetzalcoatl as their god their
00:07:24 most important god the most important of
00:07:28 all the gods of the gods
00:07:33 and do

162,"00:00:00 Hello, today I am going to tell you a story
00:00:05 about when I was little,
00:00:09 I think it was not
00:00:15 me, Pablo, my name is Pablo, I
00:00:20 was about 14 years old, I was 14
00:00:26 years old, babies
00:00:29 are 10 years old and people who are
00:00:36 100 years old are already old
00:00:40 and I already know
00:00:43 I died then when I was 14 I went to
00:00:47 school to study
00:00:50 and at school
00:00:53 from 11
00:00:56 to 11 thirty we didn't have class we
00:01:01 didn't have to study we could go out to the
00:01:04 patio the patio people had fun they
00:01:08 played soccer no soccer is played with
00:01:12 a goal kicking  goal
00:01:17 but me and my friends me and my friends didn't
00:01:23 play soccer
00:01:26 because later at 11:30

00:00:13 but
00:00:14 now we still don't know the story
00:00:20 we are going to think about it we are going to go
00:00:24 thinking and telling this story
00:00:30 and this is the story
00:00:33 of is the story of snow white
00:00:39 but
00:00:41 snow white has already met  her
00:00:44 prince hasn't already met the prince
00:00:48 we that prince no the prince
00:00:53 hasn't kissed her anymore
00:00:58 Snow White has woken her up
00:01:02 and
00:01:04 what's up sweetheart what do they do now to the
00:01:07 two well well the most normal thing I
00:01:13 would imagine would be  that snow white and the
00:01:19 prince go to the castle no
00:01:24 because princes and princesses live in
00:01:28 castles very well then they go to the
00:01:31 castle
00:01:33 draw the drawings
00:01:37 if the castle very well and they go they go to the
00:01:41 castle if they are on their way to the
00:01:46 castle
00:01:49 they are on their way to the  castle very well
00:01:53 and by the castle
00:01:55 they find a turtle
00:02:00 and the turtle tells them one thing it tells
00:02:06 them be careful it tells them be careful if you go to the
00:02:10 castle it will be dangerous what happens after
00:02:14 they decide to do v  they go to the castle or no
00:02:19 no they don't go to the castle because
00:02:23 snow white is very scared she is very scared she
00:02:28 is very scared because she thinks
00:02:33 that
00:02:34 maybe her stepmother maybe the witch the
00:02:40 queen yes maybe she is still alive
00:02:46 snow white is afraid that the queen
00:02:49 is alive and waiting in  the
00:02:54 castle is in the castle waiting and
00:02:57 watching for him to come back very well
00:03:00 then the
00:03:03 prince
00:03:04 the prince is going to look for some of
00:03:09 his men he is going to look for soldiers several
00:03:13 soldiers several soldiers and the prince
00:03:16 go to the castle
00:03:19 in arms they have swords they go to the castle
00:03:23 and in  the castle they don't see anything they don't
00:03:27 find anything yes but then
00:03:31 they leave they leave the castle and they don't find
00:03:39 snow white they don't find
00:03:42 snow
00:03:44 white snow white was
00:03:47 waiting in the woods
00:03:52 in the woods
00:03:54 snow white was waiting in the
00:03:58 woods with the tortoise when
00:04:03 when the prince's men and  the
00:04:08 prince
00:04:09 were in the castle they were in the
00:04:15 castle
00:04:17 when the men were in the
00:04:22 snow white castle
00:04:24 she was in the woods with the tortoise
00:04:31 yes
00:04:33 snow white was alone with the tortoise
00:04:39 yes and at that moment
00:04:42 the tortoise became the witch
00:04:51 snow white's stepmother and the tortoise
00:04:55 was actually the witch yes the witch
00:05:00 the witch
00:05:03 yes it was the
00:05:05 witch if not the  turtle
00:05:09 became the witch
00:05:12 very well but then the prince
00:05:16 prince already
00:05:18 suspected something

00:07:36 Snow White is very pretty and she wanted to
00:07:42 turn her into a turtle so

00:00:50 there was a soccer
00:00:53 field soccer field
00:00:55 and we played soccer but the playground of my
00:01:01 school was very small
00:01:04 so in the playground  soccer field
00:01:08 there was a wall there was a wall
00:01:14 and the goal was painted like that it was
00:01:21 painted and on the other side there was a step
00:01:28 a step
00:01:31 like the one on the stairs the stairs
00:01:34 have steps step step by
00:01:37 step there was only one step and there were
00:01:40 benches benches to sit on
00:01:45 sitting here and here there was also a bench
00:01:50 so this step was the goal and
00:01:55 you had to score a goal goal is when the
00:01:57 ball passes through here the ball
00:02:03 [Applause]
00:02:04 [Music]
00:02:05 [Applause]
00:02:07 the soccer field was like that and  It was very, very
00:02:10 small
00:02:12 so since here the goal was flat it
00:02:16 was painted whenever
00:02:20 the ball touched more or less around here
00:02:26 there were discussions inside inside no no
00:02:29 outside outside it's not a goal it's not a goal yes yes

00:04:43 be a goalkeeper
00:04:46 and the next person the second

303,"00:00:00 Today I want to talk about the things that
00:00:04 I have in my bag when I travel, hello, very
00:00:16 good to all. Well, I am going to show you
00:00:20 the things that I keep when I go on a
00:00:23 trip, more or less, it depends on the trip, it
00:00:27 depends on the place I go, it depends on
00:00:32 the season of the day.  year if I go in winter or in
00:00:36 summer
00:00:38 but hey I'm going to show you more or less
00:00:41 the things that they only carry we're going to see
00:00:46 a passport a passport doesn't have a
00:00:49 drawing it's very old of
00:00:52 course if you travel outside the european union you
00:00:58 need a passport so like me
00:01:02 now  I live in China, so
00:01:05 I always carry it
00:01:07 and we'll see how
00:01:10 well
00:01:13 the wallet is worth the wallets
00:01:18 I always have two wallets just in case
00:01:21 I have a small wallet
00:01:25 here I have a little bit of money
00:01:28 and normally when I want to pay I use
00:01:34 this wallet I take out this wallet
00:01:39 then I have the big wallet  which is
00:01:43 more hidden inside the
00:01:47 bag and here I have more money and I have
00:01:52 cards without a card
00:01:57 more things I have
00:02:01 a battery for the mobile because of course
00:02:06 when I travel I take out a lot
00:02:09 Too many photos then my mobile battery
00:02:16 dies the battery runs out I can't
00:02:20 use my mobile so I always carry
00:02:24 this portable battery
00:02:30 and of course
00:02:33 to use it I need a cable
00:02:38 here sorry I dropped it
00:02:42 this
00:02:44 is the portable battery cable
00:02:49 more things  that I always carry,
00:02:53 we're going to see
00:02:57 [Music]
00:02:59 in many things, oh, of course
00:03:05 ,
00:03:10 we can use tissues and tissues in many situations,
00:03:14 in many places, many times, for
00:03:18 example, many times in Asia when you go
00:03:22 to the bathroom there is no paper, so tissues
00:03:27 are very  useful
00:03:32 and then also sometimes the wipes yes well
00:03:37 for example to clean your
00:03:40 hands or face or whatever it is always
00:03:46 useful to have wipes
00:03:49 more things that I carry around here
00:03:55 [Music]
00:03:57 well those are general things
00:04:01 well of course the mobile we all carry the
00:04:05 mobile  Nowadays
00:04:07 the mobile is what I am using now
00:04:11 to record this
00:04:15 so of course the mobile is used to
00:04:21 see the maps of the places it
00:04:25 also serves as a translator, that is to say
00:04:29 To understand other languages,
00:04:34 take photos,
00:04:36 by the way, I don't have a camera
00:04:39 before, but now I do everything with
00:04:45 my mobile because I also think that if
00:04:50 I have a good, big camera, I'm going to
00:04:55 accidentally break it
00:05:00 because things always fall when I  I usually
00:05:03 always have that problem so it
00:05:08 wouldn't be a good idea
00:05:10 I also have a
00:05:15 self stick and a stick to take pictures of myself
00:05:19 let's see it
00:05:22 's the self stick and to take pictures
00:05:27 I always said that I don't want sticks the
00:05:31 film is very ridiculous it's very silly but
00:05:34 I  I always travel alone or almost always
00:05:40 so no sometimes it
00:05:43 's the only way the only solution
00:05:47 to have photos of myself in a place
00:05:51 because I always have many photos of
00:05:54 places but I'm not in the photo it
00:05:57 seems I got this photo on google
00:06:02 in  internet
00:06:04 and more things like that that are more personal
00:06:10 [Music]
00:06:12 we are going to see band-
00:06:14 aids
00:06:17 for the feet because I really like to
00:06:21 walk many times I walk a lot and I look at my
00:06:27 cell phone and I see that I have walked more than 20
00:06:31 kilometers and I am not tired, yes  My
00:06:35 feet hurt a lot so I always need to
00:06:40 have band-aids in my bag for
00:06:44 my feet, it's
00:06:47 worth more things,
00:06:50 well, women, girls, you'll
00:06:55 understand me, because once a month this happens to us,
00:06:59 we have our period,
00:07:04 so I always have a pad,
00:07:13 a tampon, yes, women, you understand me
00:07:19 more.  things
00:07:21 the keys
00:07:26 when I travel I don't have the keys to my
00:07:30 house in this bag
00:07:32 why
00:07:35 sure probably good probably
00:07:39 not but if I lose them I can't get into
00:07:43 my house when I get back
00:07:46 but I do have the keys to the hotel or
00:07:50 hostel where I'm
00:07:54 staying other than  I always have it's a
00:07:59 bottle of water I
00:08:01 drink water many times a day I drink more
00:08:07 than two liters for sure
00:08:10 so always always
00:08:15 the bottle of water is like my best
00:08:17 friend
00:08:21 and then
00:08:25 if I have dry lips sometimes so
00:08:30 I take cocoa
00:08:36 for my lips  and
00:08:40 a
00:08:43 pink lipstick because I really like to
00:08:47 paint my lips
00:08:51 and
00:08:54 these are the things that I normally have
00:08:58 then sometimes I have different things for
00:09:01 example
00:09:03 a v  Sometimes
00:09:05 I don't carry wipes I do
00:09:09 n't carry
00:09:11 wipes because sometimes my bag is very
00:09:15 small
00:09:18 and some cookies come in
00:09:21 very large boxes in very large packages and
00:09:24 sometimes I carry this
00:09:27 is a hand sanitizer
00:09:32 to wash your hands when there is no soap or water
00:09:35 it often happens in asia
00:09:40 then also sometimes i take pills
00:09:45 for
00:09:49 headaches sometimes i usually forget i
00:09:52 forget but sometimes i remember to
00:09:56 take them
00:09:59 in summer i take sun cream
00:10:03 sunscreen so i don't
00:10:11 burn in winter take a cream  for the
00:10:14 hands because my hands are very
00:10:21 dry sometimes I take the mobile phone charger
00:10:25 yes I know that I am going to sit in a place and
00:10:29 I am going to find a plug a plug
00:10:36 and for example if I have a flight if I have
00:10:41 to be on a plane or in a  train
00:10:44 sometimes I carry a small notebook
00:10:51 with a pen without a pen to write on
00:10:57 so those are the things that
00:11:01 I normally carry in my bag when
00:11:03 I travel of course when I travel I carry
00:11:08 more personal things  But those things are in the
00:11:11 backpack in the big backpack, yes,
00:11:14 well, those are the things that I
00:11:18 usually have in here or in another bag,
00:11:22 and well, tell me if you have
00:11:27 the same things or have something
00:11:29 different,

136,"00:00:00 Well, no, no, no, no, no,
00:00:01 well, today I'm going to talk to you about the five
00:00:05 types of boyish men in
00:00:12 Spain.
00:00:14 The first team is the heavy. The heavy is
00:00:21 a prehistoric species from when
00:00:23 dinosaurs existed. I've heard that the
00:00:30 heavies  they lived with dinosaurs at the
00:00:33 same time the heavies
00:00:37 only reproduce with other heavies and they
00:00:42 have baby children
00:00:45 and the heavies on the outside look tough
00:00:51 but on the inside they have a heart a
00:00:56 soft soft heart
00:00:59 and the weak point of the heavies is
00:01:05 david bisbal david bisbal is like
00:01:08 kryptonite like kryptonite for
00:01:10 superman
00:01:12 the second type is justin
00:01:17 bieber justin bieber is an invasive species invading the
00:01:21 usa
00:01:26 well sorry from canada but it
00:01:30 's the same justin bieber is an
00:01:34 invasive species just like the
00:01:37 american crayfish
00:01:39 or the
00:01:42 but lately justin bieber has been
00:01:45 in decline
00:01:49 and there are fewer and fewer of them the third type is

00:00:50 looked for those that are I don't know special those
00:00:54 that are very specific to Thailand no
00:00:58 and well I normally don't I don't
00:01:04 eat many snacks no because well it's not
00:01:09 very healthy food it's not very good
00:01:13 for my health but I go  to make an
00:01:18 exception I'm going to sacrifice for
00:01:22 you okay because I love you I love you I
00:01:26 love you
00:01:28 so let's see what we have
00:01:34 well these are chips they are not chips I don't know
00:01:39 if they are wheat chips if it looks like they are
00:01:43 wheat they
00:01:45 are made with  not with wheat and they have
00:01:49 that it is this this is a cuttlefish they have
00:01:53 cuttlefish they like cuttlefish it
00:01:57 's a bit strange not in Spain
00:02:01 normally potato chips or in this
00:02:05 case wheat or corn these types of
00:02:08 chips
00:02:10 normally don't have gu
00:02:14 These seafood dishes do not taste like fish,
00:02:18 for example, not normally, but well,
00:02:22 I am going to try them, they
00:02:26 smell, they smell good, they
00:02:34 are good, they are good,
00:02:38 monosodium glutamate,
00:02:40 very good,
00:02:43 but not only are there chips with cuttlefish flavor,
00:02:49 but there are also pieces of
00:02:52 cuttlefish.  that piano yes yes
00:02:56 let's see let's try it
00:03:01 if these are pieces of
00:03:05 toasted cuttlefish I guess toasted
00:03:10 the oars
00:03:12 are crunchy
00:03:15 look look it
00:03:19 's crunchy and well it tastes like it tastes
00:03:23 like shellfish not a bit like fish more
00:03:27 or less it's spicy it also has a  Little bit
00:03:31 of taste of chili chili pepper
00:03:36 is a bit a bit spicy is it so good
00:03:40 or not
00:03:42 yes yes it's good
00:03:45 I put it in notes or that I can put
00:03:47 notes to each thing I can put an
00:03:51 8 poor 8
00:03:55 to this to the sepia to the  cuttlefish puts it
00:03:59 baked cuttlefish not
00:04:03 baked cuttlefish I'm going to put a 6 on the cuttlefish
00:04:08 what else do we have okay this is the last
00:04:13 thing that comes from the sea it's not nori
00:04:17 seaweed long nori seaweed nori it's not something
00:04:21 specific to Thailand you eat it in  Japan
00:04:24 It is eaten in Korea I think that this way of
00:04:28 eating eat only nori seaweed I think it
00:04:32 comes from Korea I think it is a
00:04:34 Korean thing not to take the seaweed take the
00:04:37 nori and add some flavor
00:04:40 to it sometimes put salt on it a little more and eat just
00:04:44 the seaweed like this  but hey in thailand they have
00:04:48 their own version their own flavor and this
00:04:51 is with a spicy flavor with a spicy flavor let's
00:04:54 see how spicy it is
00:04:58 this is it's already it's just this it's
00:05:01 cheap this costs little money
00:05:04 but it's only one
00:05:07 one  sheet a sheet like this sell something let's see
00:05:14 if it's good it doesn't have much salt
00:05:19 but it's not spicy I don't notice the spiciness it may
00:05:24 be because the cuttlefish was already
00:05:27 applied but I don't know I like it I
00:05:30 like it a lot this
00:05:35 is good too 18  I'm going to put an
00:05:38 8 it's good it was quite good now it's
00:05:42 okay there are two more things that are not
00:05:45 sweet the rest are already sweet they already have
00:05:49 sugar no the first is this what is this they
00:05:54 are sticks they are bread sticks I don't
00:05:58 suppose something similar to bread  will be  No wheat,
00:06:01 above all, it will be wheat, I suppose if it is almost
00:06:06 all 60% wheat, but it reminds me of
00:06:10 the markets in Spain, they are called mikado,
00:06:14 in Japan, they are because it is not, because it is
00:06:18 the same brand, Glick, or the same brand
00:06:20 that makes a little, but in  In this case, they
00:06:23 are prex crex. I think they are
00:06:28 some crackers, some salty crackers,
00:06:31 if I don't know, it is this, what is it? I
00:06:35 have never tried it, but they are
00:06:39 sticks like breadsticks
00:06:43 with an atomium flavor and tongyan is a
00:06:46 very typical Thai food that is
00:06:50 a soup.  with good it can be with chicken it
00:06:54 can be with prawns many times it's
00:06:56 with prawns
00:06:58 and well I'm going to try to see if it really
00:07:01 has a flavor of toma or it's not
00:07:05 good it shows the taste of
00:07:10 lemongrass lemongrass is a grass
00:07:13 like a grass remains  a lot a lot of flavor
00:07:18 and it's good
00:07:21 I like it I like it
00:07:23 well I'm going to put an 8 too
00:07:27 many eights but it's that it's good
00:07:29 and this is the ultimate in salty taste
00:07:34 these are that they are are peanuts here
00:07:37 you can see the peanuts to me  They like
00:07:40 I like peanuts but they are
00:07:43 coated peanuts coated with
00:07:47 good dough like a dough also made of
00:07:50 wheat
00:07:53 look look
00:07:57 no inside there is a peanut
00:07:59 up to the peanut and then the coating
00:08:02 the dough does not and the dough has a good
00:08:07 original flavor it has a flavor of coconut milk  it's
00:08:11 made with coconut not coconut and it tastes
00:08:15 a bit like coconut flavor it's good I
00:08:18 like this yes I've eaten this
00:08:23 before
00:08:25 there are different flavors there is
00:08:27 chicken flavor there is wasabi flavor there are also
00:08:32 several different flavors yes it's ok
00:08:35 I'll go with it  to put a 7 maybe and speaking of
00:08:39 coconut
00:08:41 the coconut
00:08:42 the coconut is used a lot in thailand they
00:08:46 eat a lot of coconut and it is used to make
00:08:49 things to do different things and this
00:08:52 is also coconut it is made with coconut and
00:08:55 this good is a waffle waffle
00:08:58 biscuit I'm going to open it so you can
00:09:01 see it
00:09:03 and if it's a normal biscuit
00:09:06 waffle in Spain you can also
00:09:09 find waffle like this normally
00:09:13 with chocolate vanilla cream they are the
00:09:16 most  common vanilla I don't know about cream
00:09:19 or chocolate I think they are the most
00:09:21 common but this one is coconut I wanted I
00:09:25 wanted to try the coconut
00:09:30 so it does have a coconut flavor
00:09:32 right away you can tell the smell
00:09:35 of the coconut role comes to you and it's also good  it's
00:09:39 very good come to another another 8 and there are more
00:09:43 fruit things if I'm going to go with the
00:09:47 fruit things the sweet fruit things
00:09:49 first what is this these are cookies
00:09:51 but they are filled cookies have here
00:09:55 the filling
00:09:57 and what is this filling this filling
00:10:01 it's
00:10:02 pineapple jam like a jam
00:10:06 but pineapple
00:10:08 with pineapple
00:10:10 and this this pineapple jam is very
00:10:15 common it's in many Thai sweets
00:10:19 in many many Thai snacks and such
00:10:21 this this pineapple jam
00:10:25 is not my favorite type of jam
00:10:29 no I don't like it very much  This this jam
00:10:32 has a very strong flavor very
00:10:36 very intense no but well I'm going to
00:10:39 try it it sticks it sticks like the super the
00:10:44 club like glue it sticks a lot
00:10:48 it sticks to your teeth if it's already with one that
00:10:52 's it
00:10:55 This is not enough, I'm going to give it a 44
00:11:00 if it were for the taste, for the
00:11:03 taste,
00:11:04 maybe it would be a 5, but it
00:11:08 also sticks to your teeth, so
00:11:11 a 4, I'm sorry, but a 4,
00:11:16 what else?  We have
00:11:18 mango dehydrated mango I'm going to open it they
00:11:22 are strips they are strips mango strips
00:11:28 have sugar also the mango strips
00:11:32 I'm going to try
00:11:33 this one it's spicy pica pica
00:11:37 so this is mango it's not mango
00:11:41 we have mango here mango
00:11:45 dehydrated mango mango that has been removed
00:11:48 the water has been dehydrated
00:11:52 and there is a lot of it there is a lot in thailand
00:11:54 there is a lot of fruit dehydrated fruit
00:11:58 I do like dehydrated mango
00:12:02 this one has sugar
00:12:05 without sugar a little bit of salt too and the
00:12:09 chili spicy chili no the spicy chili
00:12:13 is  Well, it's quite good. I'd give it
00:12:16 a 7, maybe more.
00:12:37 Well, a fruit, at least
00:12:40 with tamarind, it also makes a lot of
00:12:44 food, it's cooked, it's used to cook,
00:12:48 to give a taste like that, a little
00:12:51 acid, a little like a lemon, I'm not going
00:12:56 to try it, this one has sugar, they
00:12:59 also put sugar in it
00:13:03 and it has  bones also have the bone the
00:13:07 tamarind well it's fine it's not it's not my
00:13:11 favorite it has a very strong taste very
00:13:15 intense well I'm going to give it a 5 and maybe
00:13:20 a 50 I'm sorry
00:13:23 tamarind that more than closer we are getting
00:13:26 closer to the end what is this they are  pipes but
00:13:33 they are not sunflower seeds they are not
00:13:37 pumpkin pumpkin seeds no no they are not
00:13:42 watermelon seeds watermelon seeds yes in Spain
00:13:47 we don't eat watermelon seeds let's see I
00:13:52 ate them a long time ago I've already tried them I
00:13:56 've eaten them before but  I do not
00:13:59 remember I have forgotten the taste of the
00:14:02 flavor that they have to see how they are they
00:14:07 are big they are very big they are just as
00:14:12 big as the pumpkin
00:14:17 seeds of the pumpkin seeds so then these
00:14:20 will be special watermelons some
00:14:23 different watermelons  Let's
00:14:28 see how they
00:14:31 look, they look like this, they're not
00:14:35 green, they're not green like
00:14:39 the pumpkin ones, they
00:14:42 don't have very little flavor, it's that
00:14:45 the tamarind has a
00:14:49 very strong flavor and now  This did not notice anything, it does not have
00:14:53 any flavor the seeds are not very
00:14:57 crunchy I don't like them I like
00:15:02 the pumpkin ones better yes
00:15:06 you are good yes I like the seeds
00:15:10 that's why I like the seeds I am going to
00:15:14 put a 7 and lastly this is  The
00:15:18 last thing we're almost done with is this
00:15:26 I don't know what this is says euro cake
00:15:30 makes it hard like euro like european no
00:15:36 but no I don't know if it's made in europe
00:15:38 really let's see it
00:15:42 's halal
00:15:44 thailand euro food
00:15:48 made in thailand
00:15:51 15 manufactured by european food
00:15:54 public and  there is an address in thailand i
00:15:57 suppose it is made in thailand but
00:16:00 it is called european bakery i saw these
00:16:04 a long time ago in thailand maybe
00:16:07 yes maybe it is a brand that sells well
00:16:09 this is not pastries and pastries
00:16:14 european style  No,
00:16:18 well, I'm going to try it. I don't know if I've
00:16:21 tried it before, I would say that I've never
00:16:23 tried this type
00:16:26 of buns. I know that they usually sell them
00:16:30 in boxes, in larger boxes with many
00:16:33 buns, but hey, I've seen that they sold
00:16:36 only one and it's better not like that.
00:16:40 I don't have to eat many on the outside, yes,
00:16:44 it's similar to some
00:16:48 pastry buns that we have in Spain or
00:16:50 Europe, as I'm going to try, they remind me of
00:16:56 this, it reminds me of Saturdays,
00:16:59 Saturdays are very good, they are more or less
00:17:02 like a cupcake but better  better than
00:17:07 a cupcake this says it's filled
00:17:09 with custard around here custard no
00:17:13 this isn't custard look no it's not
00:17:17 matilla
00:17:19 I don't know it's a slightly transparent paste
00:17:22 like egg it's not okay it's not
00:17:26 bad this
00:17:29 I don't really like the  pastries but good
00:17:32 as pastries, well, it's not bad, it's not
00:17:35 very dry or anything, so
00:17:40 I don't know what grade I'm going to give it 7 6 6
00:17:45 1
00:17:46 and even this is good, all the snacks are
00:17:54 different or totally
00:17:57 different from what I  You would find them in
00:18:00 Spain or they have some element

00:00:06 a butterfly that weighed 3 kilos and a
00:00:12 butterfly that weighed 3 kilos, whether
00:00:17 you believe it or not, it is
00:00:21 a legend from a long time ago in a
00:00:26 town a town there are houses house house
00:00:31 this is a town
00:00:34 and this is a town in asturias asturias
00:00:40 asturias and in this town there was a man
00:00:45 there was a man
00:00:49 a man who had had money
00:00:52 the man had money and this man
00:00:59 married a woman yes and had two daughters had
00:01:04 a daughter daughter  older and a younger daughter
00:01:09 but his wife died
00:01:14 she died
00:01:16 so the daughters the daughters did not have a
00:01:20 mother
00:01:22 the woman died she died years ago
00:01:26 and the daughters were called inés
00:01:32 inés and clara
00:01:36 and their father and her father liked her she liked her
00:01:41 very much
00:01:44 inés but clara clara not so much because
00:01:49 inés was a very good girl when her
00:01:53 father called her inés access in is something else
00:01:58 inés ok ok ok ok now I do it
00:02:01 now I do it
00:02:03 then one day her father found a
00:02:08 man and told him said haines inés you
00:02:13 house get married  so so so so so
00:02:20 marry him ines ok ok
00:02:24 inés went
00:02:27 he married he married he married this man
00:02:32 but later he did the same with clara

00:02:55 another other man and later they got married
00:03:02 she married another man then her
00:03:06 father got angry got angry
00:03:10 then the father gave a lot of
00:03:15 money to inés haines
00:03:20 he gave her money but she clarifies she doesn't clarify she did
00:03:25 n't give her money then inés and her  her husband
00:03:30 was very well but Clara and her husband
00:03:34 did not have money, it was very, very
00:03:38 difficult for her, Inés wanted to give Clara money, Inés wanted to give money to
00:03:43 Clara, but she was afraid
00:03:48 of her father. If her father had known
00:03:51 that she was giving Clara money, her father would be
00:03:57 angry.
00:03:59 step by step time and her father
00:04:03 died he died
00:04:06 and all his money
00:04:09 went to inés all the money went
00:04:14 to clara nothing zero
00:04:17 00 euros
00:04:20 so inés wanted to give
00:04:24 clara money but her husband said no no no no no
00:04:27 the money is new  stro then one day they
00:04:31 all
00:04:33 went to the church the church to
00:04:38 pray to pray for the death of their father
00:04:42 they all went to pray
00:04:45 inés inés prayed that clarifies clarifies it
00:04:51 would go well for her because she had no money and
00:04:54 when she was praying she noticed in her head she
00:04:58 noticed a peso a  I weigh a large one of more or
00:05:03 less 3 kilos
00:05:06 and when I look I saw a butterfly
00:05:10 a butterfly flying
00:05:13 a butterfly how could it be that it weighs
00:05:16 so much
00:05:18 and again I notice
00:05:21 and yes yes yes it was the butterfly that weighed it
00:05:24 weighed a lot and it was a normal butterfly
00:05:27 it was not a butterfly  big
00:05:31 and a normal butterfly like this
00:05:35 when they left the church
00:05:39 inés
00:05:42 inés
00:05:44 and her husband
00:05:48 inés told her husband the butterfly there is
00:05:52 a butterfly that weighs a lot and the husband
00:05:54 said na na na
00:05:57 but then the butterfly
00:06:03 came and landed on top of the husband and it was heavy  a lot
00:06:08 and then it perched on who and then
00:06:11 again on the husband and then Agnes
00:06:17 asked her husband come come this is
00:06:21 a sign

00:06:54 flew away flew away
00:06:58 and was very is very happy the
00:07:01 butterfly
00:07:02 was happy and what  Do you think about
00:07:06 history? Do you think that
00:07:09 butterflies can weigh three kilos or not? It
00:07:12 's impossible, no, but this is a legend,

335,"00:00:01 In Spain if we order a coffee
00:00:06 [Applause]
00:00:07 we order a coffee we want to drink a coffee and
00:00:12 the coffee costs one euro
00:00:16 one euro
00:00:17 and 50
00:00:21 cents or one euro one and a half euros not on
00:00:26 the menu
00:00:28 on the menu we write 1.50
00:00:36 is not 1.50 not
00:00:42 today  We are going to see the differences
00:00:47 the differences on how we write
00:00:51 the numbers how we write the hours
00:00:56 how we write the dates
00:01:01 in Spain hello well yes as I
00:01:12 told you when we write we write
00:01:15 decimal numbers 0
00:01:19 33
00:01:22 2000
00:01:26 3.15 we write the comma if we do not write
00:01:31 a point
00:01:33 and  come in front of the comma we
00:01:39 need a zero if we can't
00:01:43 write comma three and that's it there doesn't always
00:01:49 have to be a zero
00:01:52 I know that in some countries like the United States they
00:01:55 write I don't know point point two and that
00:02:00 's it and this is fine in Spain no  no
00:02:04 no we do not do this we write the zero
00:02:09 as we write the day as we write
00:02:13 the date well as in many
00:02:18 places in many parts of the world
00:02:21 we write the day then the month and then
00:02:27 the year for example I don't know the 1st of
00:02:33 d  December would be 0 11 of 12 of
00:02:38 this year for example 2020 not December 1
00:02:43 December 31 the last
00:02:48 day of the year would be 12/31/2008 they
00:02:56 can be bars they can
00:02:59 also be hyphens sometimes with hyphens yes
00:03:04 normally almost always  In Spain
00:03:07 this is this format I like I like to
00:03:13 write the year 2020
00:03:18 on 12
00:03:20 31 first
00:03:23 especially
00:03:25 on the computer when used when I use the
00:03:29 computer to work well I like to
00:03:34 use this format but in Spain it is
00:03:38 not used this format is not used  of course
00:03:43 we don't write the month first
00:03:48 and then the day and then the year
00:03:53 what is this one is crazy
00:03:56 we are crazy or what
00:03:58 not no no of course not now how do
00:04:02 we write the time well
00:04:04 we use the 24 hour system
00:04:09 that's why the  00 and 00 are 12
00:04:17 at night it
00:04:19 's midnight it's 12 12 at
00:04:24 night at 12 it's at noon not exactly
00:04:29 at noon
00:04:31 at 13
00:04:34 it's one o'clock in the afternoon and well you
00:04:39 arrive until 11 p.m.  until 11:00 p.m., which is
00:04:46 11:00 a.m.  11 at night when you look at
00:04:51 the timetable, the train or bus timetable,
00:04:56 for example, you will
00:05:00 always see it in 24-hour format like this,
00:05:05 but when we talk
00:05:09 sometimes we often say well, 1 o'clock, not 11 o'clock, not 12 o'clock,
00:05:16 there is one thing that is not  we do not
00:05:20 have 25
00:05:24 o'clock 26 o'clock we do not have this is seen in japan
00:05:30 for example not in japan in japan for
00:05:36 example if a bar a bar is open
00:05:40 until one
00:05:43 until one until 2 in the
00:05:48 morning sometimes they write 25 o'clock 26 as  here
00:05:53 you can see it not in spain no we don't
00:05:57 write it so more money
00:06:00 money as you have seen in spain
00:06:04 we write the number first and then
00:06:08 the currency we write one euro
00:06:14 1 dollar
00:06:16 we don't write euro euro 1 dollar 1 in
00:06:22 fact nobody nobody says dollar  One does not
00:06:26 write in dollar one but they say one dollar
00:06:30 so if I don't know I don't know why in
00:06:34 Spain we don't do this
00:06:37 we write it we write it the same as we
00:06:41 say it one euro one dollar the same as I don't know
00:06:47 one meter one kilogram no well the same as
00:06:52 the united  des we write the coins the
00:06:56 zeta the letter zeta
00:06:59 of this I have another video a video
00:07:02 only about the letter zeta but the
00:07:06 letter zeta in Spain sometimes
00:07:10 we write it like this sometimes we write it
00:07:13 crossed crossed with a line a line in
00:07:18 the center yes it seems to be  It is used in
00:07:23 Germany, in Italy, in France, in Spain, of
00:07:27 course, and it is because in mathematics, in
00:07:31 mathematics, in mathematics, it is easy
00:07:36 to see the difference, the difference between
00:07:40 the number 2 and the number 2,
00:07:44 so that is why it began to be
00:07:48 written like this.
00:07:49 then the seven is the number seven
00:07:54 sometimes it is like that but many times
00:07:58 especially when writing it is like that also with a
00:08:03 dash a line like this and this seems to be
00:08:08 the majority of europe also
00:08:13 the united kingdom ireland and most of
00:08:18 latin america they also write it that way
00:08:21 too  it helps it helps in mathematics
00:08:26 well always whenever you write
00:08:30 numbers it helps to
00:08:33 distinguish it from 1 from number one
00:08:37 sometimes well I don't know 1 and 7 may may be
00:08:42 a bit similar is a bit similar n
00:08:45 or quotation marks
00:08:48 when in a book, for example,
00:08:53 in a book there is a person
00:08:56 a person who speaks a person who
00:09:00 says something
00:09:02 in many countries in many countries it is
00:09:06 written it is written between quotation marks between
00:09:11 quotation marks it is written blah blah blah blah
00:09:15 blah sometimes the quotation marks are  not like this
00:09:19 bla bla bla bla bla and then like this in
00:09:23 Spain we also have Latin
00:09:27 quotes or Spanish quotes quotes not these
00:09:30 are the quotes Latin or Spanish quotes
00:09:35 that are written like this blah blah blah blah
00:09:38 blah and they are closed there is not this
00:09:41 type of quotes
00:09:44 not only  In Spanish we say
00:09:49 Spanish quotes but there are other countries
00:09:52 in Europe where they also use these
00:09:57 quotes and well
00:10:01 of course we clearly have the
00:10:06 questions and exclamations that
00:10:10 are particular to Spanish no
00:10:14 but I think you already know this and you
00:10:17 know it well and well tell me tell me  in
00:10:22 your country
00:10:24 you do the same if you do the same as
00:10:27 us or not if you write if you write
00:10:32 1,2 or 1.2
00:10:37 tell me if it is  you write like this if you
00:10:40 write it after the coin after the
00:10:44 number if you cross the z the crossed 7
00:10:50 or if you use these quotation marks I know that in
00:10:54 your country you do not use the
00:10:58 question marks and exclamation marks but the
00:11:01 others tell me tell me below in the
00:11:05 comments if  Do you use the same ones or not or
00:11:10 do you use different ones? Okay, and if
00:11:15 you really want to learn Spanish,
00:11:18 you want to improve your Spanish, you want to
00:11:22 know what videos that Dreaming
00:11:26 Spanish videos to watch first, how to use
00:11:30 Dreaming Spanish, I recommend the
00:11:35 one-dollar course,
00:11:36 I'm going to write it
00:11:39 as in Spanish.  a dollar the course of a

00:02:28 rabbit, but it also had that top ten and
00:02:34 device, it had duck aa and it also had
00:02:39 snails too.  I had snails Do
00:02:45 you like snails
00:02:48 Paella is cooked in a frying pan A
00:02:52 frying pan is something like that used to
00:02:58 cook things on the fire but this
00:03:03 paella frying pan doesn't have a handle It doesn't
00:03:06 have a handle but it has two handles like this
00:03:12 and it's a  very shallow frying pan the
00:03:16 normal arts deep the paella the
00:03:20 paellera is shallow and very large
00:03:24 there are some very large frying pans for more
00:03:29 than 100 people people 100 people

197,"00:00:00 Today I'm going to talk about a topic that
00:00:06 interests me and it's space x space x
00:00:14 [Music]
00:00:21 Well maybe you know
00:00:26 space x because a short time ago they launched
00:00:32 a car they
00:00:34 launched
00:00:36 a car they launched a car into space into
00:00:43 space not me  the first time i got
00:00:50 interested in space x was when they were
00:00:55 trying to land a rocket they don't have
00:01:00 a rocket they
00:01:03 have a rocket and they were
00:01:05 landing it landing on a ship they
00:01:10 have a ship
00:01:13 a ship at sea
00:01:17 and they were trying trying to
00:01:22 land the rocket here yes but
00:01:30 not yet  they had done it yet they hadn't done it yet
00:01:34 they hadn't succeeded no
00:01:37 when i saw it the rocket fell and
00:01:42 exploded one exploded yes yes
00:01:47 this happened in 2015 in 2015
00:01:54 and since 2015 i have watched their
00:01:59 launches their rocket launches
00:02:03 and their landings landings  on land
00:02:09 on land rockets also land
00:02:16 on land and in the sea too this
00:02:21 is impressive it's like the future it
00:02:28 doesn't look like a movie a
00:02:33 science fiction movie  n not like star
00:02:37 wars or star trek or something like that and this
00:02:43 time they launched a car they launched
00:02:47 a car into space because the rocket is
00:02:52 a new rocket is a rocket
00:02:56 what is a rocket that's 33 rockets
00:03:01 and this is the  The first time they launch it, it
00:03:04 's a test. They couldn't put something on top of it. They
00:03:09 couldn't put something very expensive that costs a
00:03:13 lot of money.
00:03:29 more powerful the most
00:03:33 powerful in the world the most powerful in the
00:03:38 world now now before before there were
00:03:44 more more powerful rockets but
00:03:49 spacex are already building the
00:03:53 next one building the next
00:03:56 biggest biggest rocket and they are
00:04:01 making a rocket a rocket
00:04:05 a rocket this part comes back and
00:04:10 it lands
00:04:13 and this part also comes back
00:04:18 and lands yes and that's how they want to go to
00:04:23 space that space costs less
00:04:27 money little money and with this rocket they
00:04:32 want to make a city a city a
00:04:38 city on Mars  on mars yes yes yes
00:04:43 seriously what do you think is it possible or
00:04:47 not is it impossible
00:04:51 elon musk is the director the
00:04:55 executive director of spacex elon more than says
00:04:59 that it is very important it is very important to
00:05:03 make a city on mars if you
00:05:09 who believe on mars what  Is he crazy
00:05:13 or not
00:05:15 but in any case in the future if going to

367,"00:00:00 In ancient times, before the development
00:00:04 of science,
00:00:06 the Greeks
00:00:08 invented stories to
00:00:12 explain the different phenomena
00:00:17 of nature
00:00:20 and in this video I am going to tell you the
00:00:25 story of how the crime of a god
00:00:30 gave rise to winter and spring
00:00:39 [Music]
00:00:42 a long long time ago
00:00:47 zeus the god of all gods the king
00:00:53 of the gods of olympus
00:00:57 and meter the goddess of agriculture
00:01:03 had a daughter
00:01:05 and her daughter's name was persephone
00:01:11 persephone she spent the day in the field
00:01:15 with her friends the nymphs
00:01:20 picking flowers  all day persephone
00:01:24 was in the field she picked flowers they
00:01:29 played and hades the god of the underworld
00:01:36 the god of the underworld
00:01:41 spied on her he
00:01:44 watched he looked at persephone
00:01:48 he was in love
00:01:51 with persephone he was in love with her and
00:01:57 all day he spied on her one day des the
00:02:03 king  from the underworld the god of the
00:02:06 underworld
00:02:07 came to the surface he
00:02:10 opened the earth he
00:02:13 opened the earth and came out
00:02:17 and kidnapped persephone took persephone to the
00:02:24 underworld hades
00:02:27 made persepho  ne the queen of the underworld
00:02:32 the queen of the underworld
00:02:37 and meanwhile
00:02:39 to put she didn't know where persephone was
00:02:45 to put the goddess of agriculture
00:02:50 was very sad because she was looking
00:02:56 for persephone everywhere but couldn't
00:03:00 find her she didn't know where she was to
00:03:04 put she was every day  sadder he
00:03:09 was so sad so so sad that he
00:03:14 could not take care of the fields he could not
00:03:20 take care of the fields and all the trees
00:03:25 all the trees
00:03:27 began to die the trees
00:03:31 began to die the flowers
00:03:36 were also dying
00:03:39 because of meter he could not take care of the
00:03:43 field the  sky turned gray all the
00:03:48 sky that was blue before was now
00:03:53 gray all the sky was gray
00:03:58 and the rivers and lakes
00:04:02 the rivers
00:04:05 were
00:04:06 frozen the rivers were frozen
00:04:10 because demeter was very sad zeus
00:04:15 saw that the field was dying
00:04:21 and seus was worried  he was
00:04:25 worried he thought men
00:04:30 humans are going to starve because they
00:04:35 have nothing to eat
00:04:37 soon humans are going to die of hunger  hungry
00:04:41 so zeus decided to
00:04:45 talk to alex he
00:04:48 decided to negotiate with ares and told
00:04:54 des
00:04:55 persephone can be with you six months
00:05:01 of each year
00:05:03 but after six months persephone
00:05:08 has to go up to the surface to
00:05:13 be with her mother to be with de
00:05:16 meter and that was  the deal every year when
00:05:23 persephone went down to the underworld
00:05:26 [Music]
00:05:27 demeter got sad and everything on
00:05:32 earth
00:05:33 died the flowers died the sky
00:05:38 turned gray
00:05:39 the leaves fell from the trees
00:05:45 and after six months when persephone
00:05:49 rose to the surface
00:05:52 the  trees grew again the flowers
00:05:57 grew again and the sun
00:06:03 came out again the sun came out again
00:06:08 and in this way the Greeks explained
00:06:12 how winter ended and
00:06:18 spring began tell me in the comments

00:01:48 jordi what do you do at school at
00:01:52 school
00:01:54 the teacher gave us homework homework
00:01:58 no when we come home
00:02:03 when we see  Returning home you had to do your
00:02:06 homework and the next day when
00:02:10 you came back you had to show your homework for
00:02:14 the teacher to see but I did do
00:02:19 my homework at home it took a long time it took a long time
00:02:23 yes yes but you
00:02:28 know that when there is very little  time if
00:02:33 we have little time
00:02:37 we do anything very quickly yes well
00:02:40 I did that I expected and when I
00:02:46 went to school the next day to
00:02:51 school the next day
00:02:54 at 8 55 I would do
00:03:00 homework homework homework yes yes and the
00:03:03 teacher  I was asking, I was asking, I was
00:03:07 asking him about homework first,
00:03:13 and I was doing homework, then
00:03:17 this one, and I was doing homework, and then he was
00:03:22 asking me, he was asking me, and so
00:03:27 if I have done it, it will come,
00:03:30 it will take very little time
00:03:34 and at home I can  play video games
00:03:39 at school we also had 30
00:03:42 minutes
00:03:44 30 minute breaks 30 minutes of
00:03:48 recess that we would go to the playground to
00:03:52 play and play and during recess we could eat
00:03:57 we could eat at  go but sometimes
00:04:01 we were hungry or we were hungry we
00:04:05 did not want to wait
00:04:08 and we ate something in class if someone
00:04:13 ate an apple ate an apple
00:04:18 someone ate ate a sandwich a
00:04:24 sandwich
00:04:26 a chorizo ​​sandwich
00:04:29 but jordi jordi jordi would bring the
00:04:33 fabada but jordi  what are you doing do
00:04:37 n't eat the fabada in class and in class
00:04:42 sometimes we wanted to
00:04:44 laugh hahaha laugh a little so
00:04:48 we made paper balls paper balls
00:04:52 and we threw them
00:04:55 but paper balls are dangerous
00:04:59 because because a good paper ball does
00:05:05 n't hurt  but the situation can escalate it
00:05:09 can escalate I threw a ball of
00:05:13 paper at you and you throw me an eraser and it
00:05:18 goes up climbing up climbing up
00:05:21 and that's why if your friend throws you a ball
00:05:26 of paper it's best not to
00:05:31 return it and wait for you  wait for
00:05:36 you wait for you and when your friend does
00:05:41 n't remember you take toilet paper and water and
00:05:47 make a ball of wet paper
00:05:51 [Music
00:05:54 ] sometimes our friends do things a
00:05:59 little bit
00:06:00 a  a little
00:06:02 unpleasant how disgusting for example there were
00:06:07 people who would
00:06:14 stick the chewing gum the chewing gum on the
00:06:17 table on the table
00:06:21 on the table here I would stick the gum
00:06:27 but there is something even worse
00:06:31 than farting
00:06:35 I have not been it has not  been
00:06:38 when someone farted it was like
00:06:43 a nuke like a nuke
00:06:48 because everyone everyone moved
00:06:53 away made a circle
00:06:57 moved away from the person who had
00:07:00 farted the worst not farting was the
00:07:04 crime the highest crime  of all
00:07:07 even higher than biting biting
00:07:12 your partner's pencil and for me for me
00:07:16 the worst thing in class was waiting
00:07:22 for the bell to
00:07:27 ring because when you wait for
00:07:31 the bell to ring time time
00:07:36 slows down
00:07:40 slow down as if you were in
00:07:43 narnia
00:07:45 when i went to school i never skipped
00:07:49 classes i always always went to
00:07:55 class but we waited we waited
00:08:00 15 minutes
00:08:02 15 minutes and the teacher
00:08:06 yes in  I wasn't in class for fifteen minutes
00:08:10 we were leaving we were leaving school we were going
00:08:16 to a cyber a cyber or a cybercafé is a
00:08:21 place where you go more and they have computers they

00:00:04 is similar to the month quick you know the
00:00:08 nesquik and look look the cola cao is a
00:00:12 powder it is a powder that gets in it
00:00:20 is a powder that gets in the milk it
00:00:28 gets in the milk and gives it flavor  of
00:00:32 chocolate in Spain there is like a
00:00:38 rivalry between cola cao and nesquik
00:00:42 there are people who say cola cao is better
00:00:47 and other people who say no no no no he is
00:00:51 quick to ski and that he is the best but
00:00:54 cola cao is the one with the most  sales more money
00:01:00 more people buy in spain more than
00:01:06 nesquik colacao and quicker cola cao has
00:01:09 existed since 1946 from 1946
00:01:15 until now until 2017

00:01:46 practical to make the cola cao we take
00:01:49 a glass and a spoon the spoon is
00:01:52 important and we put milk milk has
00:01:57 to be hot very very very  very very

00:01:09 past male waxing
00:01:13 was a bit taboo men did not usually
00:01:19 shave they did not shave because
00:01:24 shaved men get  they looked a little
00:01:29 effeminate or vain and

00:01:43 little different very
00:01:47 old men older men do not wax but

00:03:16 especially men
00:03:21 wax with  laser in areas of the
00:03:24 body that are a little more unsightly,
00:03:29 for example when they have hair on their
00:03:34 backs or shoulders, some men
00:03:38 use laser hair removal to
00:03:42 shave their shoulders and back, but
00:03:46 laser hair removal for men
00:03:50 is not very  common not very popular most
00:03:56 common for men
00:03:59 most popular hair removal method is
00:04:04 razor men use razor for  to
00:04:08 shave and it is normal because many
00:04:13 men have blades at home to
00:04:17 shave their beards
00:04:20 so they use the blade to shave
00:04:25 other parts of the body
00:04:28 there are also many men who go to the
00:04:31 beauty salon to the beauty center
00:04:35 to get waxed to
00:04:40 wax
00:04:41 themselves  Because waxing at home
00:04:44 can be a bit complicated, so
00:04:48 many men do use wax
00:04:51 when they wax in a
00:04:56 beauty parlor and there are more and more
00:05:01 products on the market
00:05:06 specifically aimed at
00:05:09 male hair removal, as there are
00:05:12 razors
00:05:14 electric hair removal for men for
00:05:17 male hair removal or there are hair removal creams
00:05:22 specially made for men
00:05:26 if there are more and more products on the market
00:05:30 for male hair removal and
00:05:34 clearly there are more and more men,
00:05:38 especially young men who shave
00:05:42 some part of the body and in  spain the
00:05:47 men who shave the most in spain'
00:05:52 the
00:05:53 andalusians and they are worth it  cianos and why
00:05:58 this could be well
00:06:01 possibly because in these regions of
00:06:06 spain
00:06:07 it is hotter and people go to the
00:06:12 beach more people go to the beach
00:06:15 they wear swimsuits or wear summer clothes clothes
00:06:20 where well you can see a lot of skin you can
00:06:24 see the  skin of the person and for this reason
00:06:28 possibly many men in these
00:06:31 areas of Spain prefer to shave to look
00:06:36 handsome if there are also men who
00:06:40 shave because they do
00:06:43 sports
00:06:45 and well they wear sportswear and they
00:06:49 like to look more well, well, 25 pila and in
00:06:54 Spain men
00:06:58 The Basques shave the least if it could be that well in
00:07:04 the north of Spain it's colder and
00:07:08 people don't go to the beach so much and
00:07:13 if they wear winter clothes that are
00:07:17 normally very covered you can't see
00:07:22 your body
00:07:23 then maybe  That is why in the north it is
00:07:28 less common for men to shave their hair.
00:07:31 I also think that in the Basque Country
00:07:35 there is a stereotype of a very virile,
00:07:39 very masculine man, a slightly more
00:07:44 traditional stereotype and perhaps that is why the  vascos
00:07:49 de pila - s perhaps it is something that
00:07:54 is not so widespread culturally I
00:07:59 think that men and women
00:08:03 shave more in the summer months
00:08:07 when we go to the beach because we wear
00:08:11 a bathing suit if we wear a bikini
00:08:17 a bikini or a bathing suit  short it is more
00:08:21 likely that in those summer months in
00:08:25 June July August that men and
00:08:30 women shave more I think that
00:08:34 in winter in the colder months it is not
00:08:39 so common to shave so much although I
00:08:44 think there are types of people for
00:08:48 example men  They go to the gym a lot
00:08:52 all year round and they work a lot on their
00:08:56 physique and their muscles. Those men
00:08:59 tend to shave more, maybe
00:09:04 they do shave all year round.
00:09:17 that more
00:09:21 and more men shave more, it
00:09:25 's curious, it's a change in culture and
00:09:30 you shave or you prefer a more natural look,
00:09:37 tell me in the comments see
00:09:40 you soon and don't forget  By visiting the
00:09:45 dream in spanish website you will be able to see

00:00:46 and the sagrada familia when i was born
00:00:52 was being built they were still
00:00:55 building and now it is still being
00:01:00 built still  they are doing
00:01:05 construction works, in fact it is being
00:01:08 built from 1882 from 1882 to
00:01:18 2017
00:01:20 more than 100 years more than 100 years
00:01:26 now now they say we believe that we
00:01:30 will finish it in 2000
00:01:34 26
00:01:36 in total 1882 to 2026 will be 144 years a
00:01:44 long time for a church they
00:01:48 want it  finish in 2026 because 2026 is
00:01:54 100 years
00:01:57 to 100 years after gaudí died you
00:02:00 know gaudí gaudí is the
00:02:05 architect who made the plans  s plans the one
00:02:09 who designed the plans is the architect
00:02:13 so gaudi died in 1926 so from
00:02:21 1926 to 2026 there are 100 years 100 years is the
00:02:26 anniversary of gaudi's death
00:02:30 that's why they want to finish in 2026 they are
00:02:32 working hard to finish in
00:02:37 2026
00:02:40 and in 2026 when  finish the sagrada
00:02:44 familia it will be the highest church in
00:02:49 the world it will be
00:02:52 taller than all the other all the other
00:02:56 churches in the whole world
00:02:58 but when they started in 1882 gaudí
00:03:07 was not the architect gaudí no he did not start no
00:03:11 no no  the truth is that at the beginning
00:03:14 there was a man joseph and josep
00:03:21 thought oh I'm going to build a church
00:03:25 so together people friends come come
00:03:29 and it was an association an association is
00:03:32 people men women
00:03:38 go to different places they
00:03:42 go to houses
00:03:45 and people
00:03:49 and ask them for money give me  money money
00:03:52 money they
00:03:58 get
00:04:00 money they have more and more money money
00:04:07 and they raise raise money
00:04:11 to build a church
00:04:15 and in 1882 they laid the first stone
00:04:22 the stone to build later  to do
00:04:25 little by little to go doing the whole
00:04:27 church the first stone was laid in
00:04:31 1882 and gaudi saw it he saw how they did not
00:04:37 put but the architect was not gaudi he
00:04:41 was another
00:04:44 man named francisco
00:04:48 francisco na na na na na na na na that
00:04:52 he has a very long name nanana
00:04:55 very long that here no no it doesn't
00:04:58 fit me no metal it's a very long name
00:04:59 but hey his name was francisco
00:05:03 and in 1800 in 1883 francisco and josep got
00:05:12 angry they discussed the drool
00:05:16 so francisco got angry and
00:05:20 they left francisco  they left
00:05:24 so joseph
00:05:27 went looking for gaudi your gaudi come come you
00:05:30 're going to be the architect of my church
00:05:35 but gaudi wasn't there there weren't many people
00:05:38 who knew him he was very young he was
00:05:40 only 31 years old he was still very young
00:05:47 and then gaudi redesigned
00:05:52 he changed all the design the design
00:05:55 changed it he said he didn't do another
00:05:59 another
00:06:01 design another completely different design and
00:06:05 when gaudi was doing he was
00:06:08 building building the church
00:06:11 gaudi already knew  that it would take more
00:06:16 than 100 years more than 100 years gaudi already
00:06:20 knew because the church is
00:06:23 only paid for by donations donations
00:06:28 people who give money
00:06:31 give money but receive nothing in return
00:06:35 so the church does not take money
00:06:38 money does not take money from the country
00:06:43 of spain  madrid does not give money to the
00:06:47 church and the catholic church the
00:06:50 vatican the vatican is in italy in
00:06:54 rome neither does it give money to the
00:06:57 church not only only the
00:07:00 people people who give money to
00:07:03 build it for that reason
00:07:07 from 1882 until now many  Sometimes there
00:07:12 was no money there was very little
00:07:14 money and they had to stop they stopped the
00:07:18 work that's why it takes a long time
00:07:22 and Gaudí already knew that it would take more than 100
00:07:27 years but Gaudí was very smart he was very
00:07:31 smart because
00:07:36 most churches are built first  the base
00:07:41 later a little more later a little more
00:07:44 later more more more more
00:07:48 they are being built from the bottom up
00:07:53 but gaudi did not do it like that gaudi said
00:07:57 first we are going to do the  Let it be seen
00:08:01 they made a façade the façade
00:08:05 is where there is the door the door to
00:08:08 open and close
00:08:10 and around here with columns here are
00:08:15 statues of angels angels
00:08:20 holy holy saints first they made a
00:08:24 façade and then
00:08:28 and then the rest the towers towers
00:08:31 towers but  first he did something that
00:08:34 could be seen like this in the future
00:08:39 in the future people would see it and say and it
00:08:44 's very nice
00:08:46 we want to finish we want to go to the
00:08:49 end and finish the construction
00:08:53 because if you do if you do the
00:08:57 bottom part first and then more and more  it takes a
00:09:00 long time and it doesn't look pretty it looks very
00:09:05 ugly and that's how it looks prettier and
00:09:09 people see it
00:09:13 or very well we're going to give money we're going to
00:09:17 give money to finish
00:09:22 gaudi made blueprints before he died
00:09:26 but he didn't  many
00:09:30 did not make plans of everything no no no he did not have
00:09:34 enough time he made some plans
00:09:37 but later he made models models it is
00:09:41 a figure
00:09:43 with the shape he
00:09:47 did not make his models
00:09:49 and in the sagrada familia when they
00:09:52 were building it  there was even a
00:09:55 school the
00:09:58 school a place for the children of
00:10:02 the workers to study the workers were the
00:10:05 people people who were
00:10:08 building for example a hammer they
00:10:11 were building
00:10:13 the sagrada familia and they had children and the
00:10:18 children went to this school to study
00:10:23 in 1926 gaudi se  he died and they buried
00:10:30 him they buried him they
00:10:32 buried him inside the church in the
00:10:36 church here
00:10:38 this gaudi
00:10:41 is gaudi's body inside the
00:10:43 church
00:10:44 now a lot of people a lot of people come
00:10:49 to see the sagrada familia people come from
00:10:53 spain but also a lot from other
00:10:56 countries outside  from other asian countries
00:11:00 also many people many people from
00:11:04 other countries come to see the sagrada
00:11:06 familia if you come to see the
00:11:10 sagrada familia you will see that from the outside on
00:11:15 the façade if you see it it looks very old
00:11:19 very old for a long time just like
00:11:21 others that  other churches but inside
00:11:25 if you go
00:11:28 inside you will see that everything seems very different
00:11:32 or how new it seems very new
00:11:37 to imitate nature  inside it looks like a
00:11:41 forest a forest with trees tree tree
00:11:47 tree
00:11:49 has columns column column column
00:11:52 that look like trees
00:11:55 and the roof
00:11:57 sagrada familia this is the interior
00:12:01 from here you can see and the roof
00:12:06 the roof
00:12:08 lets in the sunlight the sun
00:12:14 shines
00:12:17 and through the ceiling
00:12:20 in the ceiling it collects the light and illuminates the
00:12:26 entire interior the entire interior is very
00:12:28 illuminated with sunlight it is very
00:12:31 beautiful and the sagrada familia is
00:12:34 a unesco world heritage site
00:12:37 since 1984 yes because in 1984 a world
00:12:46 heritage site  it was very difficult there were
00:12:49 very
00:12:51 few unesco did not give a world heritage
00:12:54 site to everyone no no no
00:12:56 now unesco
00:12:59 distributes world heritage as
00:13:02 if they were lollipops lollipops lollipops
00:13:07 yes yes now a lollipop a lollipop
00:13:10 a lollipop lollipops for
00:13:13 everyone well unesco is the same  to world heritage world
00:13:18 heritage world heritage it takes for
00:13:20 everyone but not before there was very little
00:13:23 that seems to interest us  I have visited the Sagrada
00:13:26 Familia twice and have
00:13:30 seen it from the inside,
00:13:33 I have seen it from the inside twice, but there are many,
00:13:36 but there are many Spaniards, otherwise they
00:13:40 have not seen it, even people from Barcelona,
00:13:42 people who have not seen it for
00:13:46 inside the sagrada familia if you come

333,"00:00:00 today we are going to look we are going to look at
00:00:05 many things but with a magnifying glass
00:00:12 yes with a magnifying glass
00:00:17 some things will surely surprise you
00:00:26 [Music]
00:00:29 hello well yes this is a magnifying glass
00:00:36 but today we are not going to use this magnifying glass no
00:00:41 because here here I have  another other magnifying glass
00:00:46 this magnifying glass is a special magnifying glass it is
00:00:52 a slightly different magnifying glass a little different
00:00:56 different from normal magnifying glasses no and we
00:01:01 are not going to use the normal magnifying glass we are going to use
00:01:04 this and this magnifying glass this magnifying glass works very well
00:01:09 this magnifying glass is called account and  it counts them
00:01:14 and why it is used to see and the threads it is
00:01:18 used to count count 1 2 3 4 count
00:01:23 threads
00:01:25 count how many threads
00:01:29 how much if there are in a fabric in a
00:01:32 fabric no
00:01:35 then this magnifying glass works very well because it
00:01:41 looks very big
00:01:43 and it  First, the first thing we are going to
00:01:46 look at is fabric, fabric, let's see what I have, I have
00:01:52 several types of fabric, so
00:01:57 first, this is cotton, yes, let's
00:02:03 see, let's see what cotton looks like,
00:02:06 if cotton is like that, you can
00:02:10 see, you can see that  there are lines
00:02:15 there are lines here ace  yes
00:02:19 and in each line there is a bit like
00:02:25 I don't know how crossed like crossed threads
00:02:29 yes
00:02:31 and now we are going to compare it we are going to
00:02:35 compare it with synthetic fabric fabric made
00:02:40 with petroleum with like or plastic or not and
00:02:45 this fabric well we see we see that it is
00:02:48 different it is not  different this fabric
00:02:52 also stretches it stretches
00:02:59 it is not very elastic it is elastic
00:03:05 and finally a towel a towel
00:03:10 we have here we have totoro and we are going to
00:03:15 see
00:03:17 how the towel is
00:03:20 and this is very different it has like bows
00:03:26 like bows like this no yes yes yes the  towel is
00:03:32 very different from the fabric to the
00:03:36 cotton fabric for example
00:03:42 what else do we have we also have
00:03:46 a scourer a kitchen scourer no no
00:03:51 it's no joke I haven't used it yet no it
00:03:55 's no it's not scrubbing the dishes with this
00:03:59 this is new it's it's  new
00:04:03 then let's see let's see the two
00:04:07 sides of course this is the scourer part let's
00:04:11 see what the scourer is like
00:04:16 having focused scourer well they are like
00:04:20 threads no simply threads
00:04:25 in many many directions yes no
00:04:30 and then the esp  onja
00:04:36 the
00:04:39 sponge part the sponge part is very very different
00:04:43 if they are like bubbles like bubbles blub
00:04:49 blub blub
00:04:51 like bubbles in the water but of course it's not
00:04:54 in the water
00:04:57 a bit like bubbles what else
00:05:00 we have I also brought velcro this is
00:05:06 good tape  velcro tape let's
00:05:10 see we have
00:05:13 how I'm going to do it this is very long
00:05:15 good it doesn't matter
00:05:18 velcro and the velcro has two two parts it
00:05:25 has this what is this this is the
00:05:28 soft part the softest part
00:05:34 and the soft part looks like this
00:05:39 It
00:05:40 is not like that, it
00:05:43 is similar to a scourer
00:05:48 or I have an idea what happens if I take the
00:05:54 hooks
00:05:56 the part with hooks this is the other
00:05:59 part of the velcro the part that is
00:06:02 rougher not that they are hooks they are a
00:06:07 bit
00:06:09 like hooks
00:06:11 so what happens  If I paste it here or
00:06:16 if the scourer has come up, of course, of
00:06:20 course,
00:06:22 and well, I'm going to show it to you, too
00:06:25 , it sticks to everything.
00:06:45 if you will see it b  well each one
00:06:48 of these points is a hook this
00:06:51 is this is this is this here
00:06:57 they are all hooks hooks hooks
00:06:59 hooks that grab that grab well the
00:07:05 threads not the threads
00:07:08 [Music]
00:07:10 okay and this is the velcro
00:07:15 another interesting thing are the mobiles the
00:07:20 screen the screen of the mobile well the
00:07:24 screens in general
00:07:27 as we are going to do it let's
00:07:30 see if you see it you can see some
00:07:33 dots some very small colored dots I
00:07:39 don't know if you'll see it well
00:07:42 I can try the other way around it's because the
00:07:46 iphone is
00:07:49 on this iphone  it has less less
00:07:52 resolution the points the pixels are
00:07:55 larger it will be seen it will be seen better
00:08:00 otherwise here we do see the points we see
00:08:03 that each pixel has three colors
00:08:08 it can be seen or not I don't know if it can be seen
00:08:10 clearly but each point the
00:08:13 white dots  Above all, they have red, green and
00:08:17 blue, they have three colors,
00:08:21 yes, I don't know if you can see it, if you can see it clearly,
00:08:24 but there is an easier way
00:08:30 to see them, it is with a
00:08:32 computer screen of a PC or, well, a Mac, in
00:08:37 this case,
00:08:38 and  This is a bit old quite old
00:08:43 so the dots the pixels are
00:08:46 large they are quite large let's
00:08:50 see it
00:08:53 how we do it if not here we do see
00:08:57 the red green blue dots better
00:09:05 it looks I don't know if it just looked good
00:09:07 too but hey  You can see that the image,
00:09:10 although the image is actually of a
00:09:13 beach, but it is made up of very,
00:09:17 very small dots and I have another screen, another
00:09:22 type of screen that is kindergarten, not
00:09:25 kindle, has a very different screen,

00:19:16 they can be seen, there are a lot of details, let
00:19:20 's see, they
00:19:25 are 25 cents, here is the number 25, and
00:19:29 here is the  number 25 with thai numbers
00:19:35 and what else puts the year year 2,562 well they
00:19:43 use a different year in thailand to
00:19:47 2,562 it was ago I don't know if the year
00:19:51 last year could be to this I don't know what it is
00:19:54 this is like a temple a temple  Buddhism,
00:19:56 which is more, they have a very similar drawing,
00:20:00 it is not, it is of another color, a
00:20:04 more yellow color, but it also has the same
00:20:08 drawing here,
00:20:09 year 2560, 2560, it is a little older, this
00:20:16 is two bats, 222 bats, and it has the same
00:20:21 same drawing, it is like I don't know  if a
00:20:24 temple or well the pagoda not the the
00:20:27 skewer that is in many temples and it says
00:20:31 country of thailand well thailand and
00:20:34 then the 10 coin is never
00:20:38 too big
00:20:40 10 bats that this is the temple does not
00:20:44 put the name but no  i know if it's
00:20:49 the palace royal palace here in bangkok
00:20:51 i'm not sure but well it's a
00:20:54 building a building from thailand and again
00:20:57 it says thailand the year
00:21:00 10 10 bats and then 10 here i also
00:21:04 brought coins thai coins
00:21:06 because i don't have euros in coins but yes
00:21:12 I have a bill I have a
00:21:14 euro bill and I am going to show you the
00:21:17 bill as well in case it is not clear to you it is
00:21:22 ten euros ten euros it
00:21:26 is written euro in the
00:21:29 Latin
00:21:31 alphabet Greek alphabet and this has an idyllic effect
00:21:35 because it is used in bulgaria and i don't know if in
00:21:39 any other country the cyrillic map is not
00:21:42 the map of the european union it has everything well
00:21:46 many details not many
00:21:49 small lines many details so that it is
00:21:52 difficult difficult to copy the
00:21:56 ticket and this is a  bridge I don't know
00:21:59 where this bridge is a bridge not being a
00:22:02 European building not the
00:22:05 euro symbol and let's see what's on the other side
00:22:09 someone's signature I don't know who this is I
00:22:12 don't know whose this is this signature we have
00:22:15 starts here
00:22:17 with colors a little I don't know I don't know what's
00:22:21 wrong with it the colors are a bit strange I don't know
00:22:24 if they change color or something
00:22:26 depending on the opposition I don't know but
00:22:30 this is the bright part no this
00:22:33 does change depending on where you look at it
00:22:36 it changes
00:22:38 This drawing is beautiful
00:22:41 and then we have the watermark, I don't
00:22:45 know how to show you, remove it with the kindle,
00:22:47 you can show it to you, not here,
00:22:51 here, without, without, without a watermark, and I can increase
00:22:55 the brightness to see,
00:22:57 and the lady appears here, no,
00:23:05 how fun
00:23:07 the  lady disappears
00:23:10 and  It seems it disappears and it appears what else
00:23:15 do I have I have here a comic a comic or a
00:23:19 manga not that good it's not in Japanese it
00:23:22 's translated into Thai but let's
00:23:25 also see what it looks like it has texture
00:23:30 not the paper the paper has good it has
00:23:34 a touch it has a certain touch  yes and this
00:23:38 paper is very different
00:23:41 very different from this for example this
00:23:44 is a book a book with illustrated
00:23:48 illustrations and
00:23:50 we can see a
00:23:53 this is very different also because it is
00:23:56 a printing press and the printing press as you will see
00:24:01 you have all these colors is this
00:24:06 way of doing  draw to draw
00:24:09 pictures with little dots with many little dots
00:24:12 you can't see here where you are here the little
00:24:17 dots boom boom boom boom boom all the little
00:24:20 dots here typical of the printing press to
00:24:23 print something with a printing press and we can
00:24:26 also compare different ways of
00:24:31 drawing or writing we have
00:24:35 pens  pen we have a marker
00:24:41 and we have a pencil I have a pencil 2 where
00:24:45 I have a pencil let's see ok I already have I have
00:24:49 a pencil I took a pencil from my
00:24:52 wife  r
00:24:52 this is a pencil not with a pencil you
00:24:55 can also paint a little like this lighter not
00:24:58 very well let's look at it with the magnifying glass
00:25:04 here we see the credit no this is
00:25:09 with a pen this with a marker and it's different it's very
00:25:13 very different and this is with a pencil
00:25:17 yes, by pencil it is also quite dark
00:25:20 in color quite black and then well
00:25:23 this is very different not this pencil
00:25:27 here is very very different you can see the
00:25:31 texture you can see the texture the touch of the
00:25:34 paper the shape not the texture
00:25:39 very well and that's it  It is everything I
00:25:44 wanted to look at with a magnifying glass with a
00:25:48 thread counter in this case
00:25:51 and tell me if you liked it,
00:25:55 tell me what you like to
00:26:00 look at with a magnifying glass, it is
00:26:04 worth writing it below in the comments

00:00:03 best thesis.
00:00:05 Hello, April 23 is the feast of
00:00:15 Sant Jordi and in Sant Jordi
00:00:19 the Ticos give a rose to their
00:00:26 girl named girl but why because he
00:00:30 gives them a rose as the legend says  that
00:00:35 a long, long time ago there was a town
00:00:39 a town that was very afraid of a
00:00:45 dragon a dragon that attacked the town
00:00:52 and ate the people the mountain had a
00:00:57 cave and jackie the dragon and every day every
00:01:02 day he went to the town to break to break houses
00:01:08 a  eat be people then the people of the
00:01:12 town began to think that we are going to do
00:01:15 what we are going to do and they decided to send him
00:01:19 a girl every day a girl
00:01:24 not yet very old
00:01:28 let's say between 15 between 15 and 20
00:01:33 years old
00:01:34 the girl was sent to  the cave so that
00:01:39 the dragon begins every day every day
00:01:43 every day a girl a girl a girl
00:01:47 but the girls wanted me me not
00:01:52 her and her and her what better then
00:01:59 the townspeople decided endorse
00:02:02 let's do a lottery a lottery is
00:02:07 po  For example, for example, with a box with
00:02:12 a
00:02:13 hole and inside there are little pieces of paper on
00:02:22 which it says no no no and if then in the
00:02:31 box there were papers and plastics, they
00:02:34 mixed and took 1 and 7, it would come out not
00:02:41 well saved but I knew that it would go away
00:02:52 to eat garlic and that worked very well in
00:02:58 the town the people were very happy
00:03:01 well well the dragon does not pay the town
00:03:04 and this continued yes or yes it took a long time
00:03:08 until one day the girl who came
00:03:14 out was the daughter of the king the  The king and the queen
00:03:22 had a daughter and their daughter was the
00:03:26 princess so the princess won the
00:03:30 lottery and all the people told the king
00:03:36 no no no but the king yes yes yes yes yes I am the
00:03:41 same as all the people of the town
00:03:46 so my  daughter also has to go to the
00:03:49 cave and the princess didn't say anything okay I
00:03:56 'm going and left the town
00:04:02 along the road the princess was on her way
00:04:09 to the cave walking alone me and along
00:04:16 the way she met a knight a
00:04:21 man on horseback
00:04:28 if the  horses passing by and the knight
00:04:33 here with a spear told him not to
00:04:39 Don't worry I'll protect you and
00:04:44 Princess Mononoke there's a dragon a
00:04:47 very scary dragon
00:04:48 go go go go go go go and the
00:04:54 knight who was sant jordi
00:04:56 said no no and the dragon appeared sancho
00:05:02 10 and the dragon they fought they fought
00:05:07 very very hard  but a very short time a very
00:05:12 short time and sant jordi and he stabbed him sant
00:05:18 jordi
00:05:18 speared him and the dragon died
00:05:26 the dragon began to bleed blood blood
00:05:32 began to bleed and from the blood
00:05:36 a rose bush was born in repsol it is a plant
00:05:42 with roses and sant  Jordi
00:05:51 cut a rose and gave it to the princess
00:05:56 and that is why today the Ticos give
00:06:01 a rose to the girls and you here in
00:06:09 that girl are going to give her a rose
00:06:13 come to God

00:00:07 decision sometimes you have to decide to over a v
00:00:16 ah no no no you do not see a
00:00:22 decision sometimes there are decisions that we think that
00:00:28 it was not a bad decision
00:00:32 it was not a good decision if I went back to the
00:00:36 past
00:00:38 then no  see i didn't want to
00:00:44 but sometimes a decision we think
00:00:48 is bad but in the future in the future
00:00:55 2018 2020 3000
00:01:00 20 it turns out it was a good thing it looked like
00:01:06 a bad thing but an owl was a good thing
00:01:11 this story is about a rabbit a

302,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about how we learn
00:00:05 languages ​​how we learn a language how
00:00:09 we learn words words of that
00:00:13 language for example the word apple
00:00:25 an apple not the word apple
00:00:30 how we learn it in our brain what
00:00:33 happens when we study we study the
00:00:38 word apple
00:00:40 in one day in one day  we do not learn the
00:00:44 whole word the whole word 100% of
00:00:48 the word in one day and that's it
00:00:50 apple that's it no no no one day
00:00:55 one day a person our friend María
00:01:00 for example María María tells us
00:01:05 this apple
00:01:08 this apple is very tasty it is very
00:01:12 good Maria talks about the apple we
00:01:18 we heard it she said apple and
00:01:24 we started we started learning the
00:01:28 word 1% we didn't start we started we
00:01:35 started learning it we started
00:01:39 and connect it to connect it with our
00:01:44 image with the image of an apple
00:01:50 but we
00:01:52 also connect it with Maria  with Maria
00:01:58 later another day
00:02:01 another day we hear we hear that someone a
00:02:05 person a person talks about a tree a
00:02:12 tree a tree of apples
00:02:15 from  apples and we connect we connect the
00:02:21 word
00:02:22 with a tree with a tree
00:02:27 and this word the word apple
00:02:31 we are connecting connecting connecting
00:02:35 with many things with many memories with
00:02:39 our memories this word is
00:02:42 becoming clearer and
00:02:44 clearer
00:02:46 we are learning
00:02:49 more and more
00:02:52 of the word  these connections the
00:02:55 connections become stronger and
00:02:58 stronger maria maria likes them she
00:03:02 likes them very much the apples with the image
00:03:05 with the trees the connections are getting stronger stronger
00:03:13 the word
00:03:16 we are also learning more and more and in the
00:03:20 future when the  word is at 80
00:03:24 90
00:03:26 100%
00:03:28 then it will be very easy when we are
00:03:32 thinking we are thinking of mary
00:03:38 right away we will think or apple when
00:03:42 we are thinking of trees when
00:03:45 we are thinking of the image in the
00:03:47 image of an apple immediately we can
00:03:51 say apple or very easily these
00:03:54 connections allow us  allow us to use the word
00:03:58 when we are thinking about the image of
00:04:01 apple dot the word the word
00:04:04 manzana when we are thinking of María
00:04:07 pum the word manzana
00:04:12 and little by little when we
00:04:15 hear the word several times
00:04:18 several days we connect it
00:04:22 we have to connect it with several things
00:04:25 not connect it only connect it
00:04:30 only with a word with a
00:04:33 word in our language in English with
00:04:36 I don't know apple no apple apple no this
00:04:39 is just a connection but
00:04:42 listening to it listening to it connecting it
00:04:46 with many things these connections are
00:04:49 strong they are stronger and we will be able to say
00:04:54 the word the word when we speak
00:04:57 very easily but the word is
00:05:01 learned little by little little by little
00:05:05 And just like we have done with
00:05:09 apple, we do it for the other
00:05:13 words for tree for knife for
00:05:19 knife for
00:05:21 worm for worm and for all the
00:05:26 other words of the Spanish language no
00:05:30 and later on not only
00:05:34 listening but also reading reading
00:05:39 reading  books well we are also going to
00:05:43 make these connections make more
00:05:46 connections
00:05:49 and in  With these connections there is also
00:05:55 grammar, grammar is already learned, the
00:05:58 same is learned together with the
00:06:02 vocabulary together with the words and so
00:06:06 little by little every day
00:06:09 every day we learn maybe 1% maybe
00:06:14 a little more but well 1
00:06:19 % is good  It's enough because we don't
00:06:23 learn one word
00:06:26 only from apple we don't learn 1%
00:06:31 of many many words many
00:06:35 many words and that's how you learn
00:06:39 you learn a language well if you like it if
00:06:44 you like dreaming Spanish and you want you
00:06:47 want to be  informed have
00:06:50 dreaming spanish information

00:07:03 some yes some I think that there
00:07:06 is no there is no red color does this
00:07:09 character have some relationship with an animal
00:07:12 his powers this character has some
00:07:17 power related to an animal yes like
00:07:22 spider-man he has the web
00:07:27 for example batman can fly like a
00:07:31 bat
00:07:33 this character  no he has no powers
00:07:38 related to an animal
00:07:41 about this character he can fly fly
00:07:44 no he can't
00:07:48 fly this character
00:07:55 is from an american comic  No, the comic
00:08:00 comes from North America, if it comes from the
00:08:03 United States, very well
00:08:07 from the United States,
00:08:12 this character
00:08:17 has been made apart from comics,
00:08:19 movies, there have been movies, not in the
00:08:23 cinema,
00:08:25 for example,
00:08:29 movies in which this character appears,
00:08:32 it's not that there is
00:08:40 this character.  He has
00:08:42 supernatural powers, powers not, for example, he is
00:08:46 very, very strong because he can fly, he can
00:08:50 see through objects no no no no they don't
00:08:56 have because they don't have
00:09:01 sonia as a
00:09:05 character this character has been the protagonist of
00:09:08 a movie this character who has been the
00:09:12 protagonist not of a movie  or from a
00:09:15 comic the protagonist is the most
00:09:17 important person and then there are more more
00:09:22 characters no but the protagonist is the
00:09:25 most important
00:09:28 this person is not he is not the protagonist
00:09:34 this is good good information but I
00:09:37 said that frank alberto was not touched by
00:09:39 this  character accompanies the
00:09:43 protagonist it's okay if it's funny from the
00:09:47 film there is a protagonist no if it's the
00:09:50 friend friend the companion of the
00:09:53 protagonist  a no it is not very good very
00:09:57 good
00:09:57 now you are doing it very well yes yes
00:10:01 he is not the protagonist and he is not a
00:10:04 companion or friend of the protagonist
00:10:06 who
00:10:10 is any good or bad
00:10:13 this character is a monster an
00:10:16 ugly and horrible monster and is not a
00:10:20 monster is a is a person is human
00:10:26 so this character is the enemy
00:10:29 of the protagonist if it is the enemy is the
00:10:34 person not against whom the
00:10:39 protagonist fights against him who fights yes it
00:10:44 is difficult to guess an
00:10:47 enemy that does not have
00:10:50 supernatural powers used in the comics
00:10:53 North Americans I think
00:10:58 there are at least two that do not have powers that
00:11:00 are very very bad they are enemies he is
00:11:04 batman's enemy yes he is an enemy of
00:11:09 batman no batman
00:11:13 I think batman is coming he
00:11:17 is batman's enemy
00:11:25 who is
00:11:28 the character smiles well  batman's enemy
00:11:31 smiles a lot if he smiles a lot you have an
00:11:38 enemy it could be the penguin no it's not
00:11:42 the penguin it's not it's a person who goes
00:11:47 dressed as a penguin came no no no it's not
00:11:51 the penguin
00:11:57 but pacman batman does not have many
00:12:00 many enemies
00:12:03 is another who also disguises himself
00:12:07 also changes that he has a
00:12:09 white face if he has a white face if his
00:12:12 face has it he
00:12:14 has it white he has it
00:12:16 painted white who is he
00:12:21 I don't remember the name  Let's present the
00:12:24 image of those who I remember the
00:12:26 name
00:12:28 of, what is he disguised as black, it
00:12:31 doesn't depend, I think it depends on the
00:12:34 film,
00:12:37 we don't accept, I think so, yes, you do
00:12:40 n't know that why he wears a
00:12:43 white face is the harlequin  of the joker the
00:12:46 touch is very difficult for being the
00:12:56 enemy the enemy for being the in I know
00:12:58 what happens is that the joker in
00:13:00 recent movies has come out a lot if it is true
00:13:04 if it is in the dark dark knight and
00:13:09 in
00:13:10 how music is 4
00:13:13 yes where it comes out  Yes, I don't remember the name
00:13:17 of the bar in the movie, but our
00:13:21 mind is used to looking for
00:13:24 the main characters.
00:13:34 well alberto has already
00:13:37 won everything organized he has already won
00:13:41 ah no

00:00:28 likes her yes yes  yes yes and
00:00:33 talking about flirting and flirting is something very
00:00:37 important and it is something very natural because it
00:00:40 is something that we humans
00:00:44 need to reproduce to have
00:00:48 babies it is not necessary to flirt
00:00:53 and in the stone age in the
00:00:56 stone age  the man the man the league goes the
00:00:59 league goes but in the stone age there
00:01:03 were no rings diamond
00:01:07 rings diamond rings in the
00:01:10 stone age there was no no no then the man
00:01:13 the man of the stone age was looking
00:01:17 for was looking for a stone was looking for a
00:01:21 pretty stone and he gave it to him the man gave it

241,"00:00:00 today we are going to talk about cards of cards
00:00:06 but these are Spanish cards they are
00:00:11 cards from Spain'
00:00:15 [Music]
00:00:20 very good hello well if we are going to talk
00:00:24 about cards of cards and the cards form
00:00:30 a deck and if it is new orange if this
00:00:34 is a deck one  deck of 50 cards 50
00:00:42 of 50 cards
00:00:47 in which deck if there are no more cards in the
00:00:51 Spanish deck or in the deck that
00:00:55 we call poker in the
00:00:57 English deck the poker deck is the one with the
00:01:00 spades
00:01:03 spades hearts
00:01:08 hearts etc this these cards
00:01:13 these  cards we call it a poker deck of
00:01:17 course and this is a
00:01:19 Spanish deck because I think that the poker
00:01:24 deck has more cards yes I believe that in
00:01:27 the Spanish deck there are 123 from 1 to 12
00:01:34 yes instead in the poker deck
00:01:37 I think there are  12 from 1 to 13 but
00:01:41 because there is the 10 and then there is the jack
00:01:47 under there is the queen and the king of course
00:01:50 then there are 33 plus
00:01:52 that yes yes and they are 13 13 x 41 exact more
00:01:57 good something marines 52 plus the elector jokers
00:02:06 and we are going to  see let's see how
00:02:09 low space is  ñola because the Spanish deck
00:02:12 does not have hearts in epics no no
00:02:22 the valley
00:02:29 I chose to highlight the country
00:02:39 and we open it there like this go ahead and the
00:02:45 honors another more plastinated plastic
00:02:49 never ends now I leave it to you
00:02:51 this one is easy thanks this one is easy
00:02:55 fantastic  very well, here we draw,
00:03:01 here we draw a card or very well
00:03:04 and the first card is the ace the frosts
00:03:09 is the 1 the number 1 which in poker would be
00:03:14 the crime is not the most exact of the
00:03:18 seas is gold 6 the ace of  golds because the
00:03:23 Spanish deck we have
00:03:25 four suits we have golds each
00:03:30 coin is a coin
00:03:34 that's not exactly why but 12 golds
00:03:40 the ace of golds this is the exact joker
00:03:43 it's not a joker a joker and it can
00:03:46 be used as any
00:03:49 exact card  it can serve as any
00:03:51 other card as well as 4 exact and there is
00:03:56 the 4 the exact four of golds
00:04:02 because you know why they are in this order
00:04:06 no I have no idea but look look there are
00:04:09 the four is this is the four of golds
00:04:12 is the same as the  of gold
00:04:15 and these are the cups the cups are
00:04:19 not used to drink
00:04:23 the cups
00:04:26 these are swords three bullets chin chin
00:04:30 chin
00:04:32 and these are the clubs the clubs a
00:04:36 vast is a clear stick a stick not a
00:04:40 wooden stick that's very good  enough
00:04:44 we have gold cups of swords and wands
00:04:48 exactly and here are the four several
00:04:52 fours I don't know I don't know why I have no
00:04:55 idea then this order yes and then continue
00:04:58 with the 2 the 3 the 4 10 4 is separated
00:05:04 anja but the truth is that  before I have
00:05:08 opened another deck that is the same
00:05:12 as this one and the order if the order was
00:05:15 the same if it is not there it is because I don't know I don't
00:05:18 know why the 17 5 6 is of interest and here
00:05:22 are the golds, all the golds are worth perfect
00:05:25 and  then well then come the
00:05:29 cups
00:05:30 then the swords and the clubs
00:05:37 are in the same order in the same
00:05:40 order as the fours interesting that is, it
00:05:44 is done on purpose yes no no no I don't know
00:05:48 why why and one thing there is another thing
00:05:53 thing that is different is different
00:05:57 from the poker deck
00:05:59 and they are the figures to draw the figures in
00:06:04 the poker deck are the j
00:06:06 the co and the box but in the Spanish deck they
00:06:08 are
00:06:11 here the jack the horse and the exact king
00:06:16 then the king also exists in the
00:06:20 poker deck that board is a king
00:06:22 but the jack the jack is similar to the
00:06:26 jack I guess I don't know it's an assistant to the
00:06:30 king I don't know but the horse is
00:06:33 different if it is different we don't have a
00:06:35 queen of course there is no queen there is a horse
00:06:40 how pretty
00:06:45 I am now it's prettier because
00:06:47 not Adrian  He likes, he
00:06:50 doesn't like women, of course,
00:06:56 so the women, the queen,
00:07:02 the queen, doesn't like it,
00:07:08 if I'm going to show you the aces, the four
00:07:13 aces, Hewitt, are very pretty, they are very
00:07:17 pretty, and then the ace of golds
00:07:22 of cups of the spade
00:07:25 and the one of spades  It is very pretty and the one with
00:07:30 clubs and the one with clubs he
00:07:34 devastated is the color is a
00:07:37 bit strange
00:07:40 and look at this deck on the back it is red it
00:07:45 has this design
00:07:49 and look look look look at this this I
00:07:53 have read I have read about this look look at
00:07:56 the  oros here have a line a  a
00:08:00 continuous stripe
00:08:02 but the cups here have a hole I know
00:08:07 if they have a hole they have a place where
00:08:10 there is no line but the swords have two
00:08:13 exact holes both above and
00:08:15 below below also yes and the clubs
00:08:20 have 33 here and here no I never
00:08:24 I had never noticed I had never noticed
00:08:26 I didn't either no it doesn't bring it I was reading
00:08:30 Wikipedia that's why I know but otherwise I
00:08:34 would never have seen that there are interesting holes here
00:08:38 and they are in all of
00:08:41 the cards look at the fours too
00:08:44 and there is another difference I don't think so  I know
00:08:49 I have thought now in fact about with the
00:08:51 Spanish orange the sweets and the 3 is
00:08:56 if they are also quite large and
00:08:58 quite beautiful their games are
00:09:02 beautiful they are bigger they usually
00:09:04 look like more important cards yes they
00:09:07 do seem important then for example
00:09:10 look there were clubs or swords  it shows
00:09:13 more swords not swords 23 exact and
00:09:18 wands above all wands not the 2 and 3
00:09:23 of wands they are very beautiful they are beautiful and
00:09:26 so big a ribbon so in many
00:09:30 games  s with the Spanish deck the two is and
00:09:34 the three are powerful cards they are
00:09:38 important cards sometimes in the poker deck they are the
00:09:41 worst loads but sometimes they are good
00:09:44 cards in poker the 2 and 3 are not very
00:09:47 strong but with the Spanish deck they are
00:09:50 play other games and they are not the same
00:09:52 games that place poker people and
00:09:55 often the two and three are very
00:09:58 strong yes it is true
00:10:00 and there is something else in spain this is the
00:10:04 deck of 50 cards but we also have
00:10:07 a deck of 40  cards of course yes a
00:10:12 deck of 40 cards in which jack
00:10:15 knight and king are insee but
00:10:19 the 8 and 9 rings are not 8 and 9 8 and 9 not
00:10:26 standard and the
00:10:29 jokers jokers are not clear
00:10:32 either yes and also the deck  With
00:10:35 40 and 50 cards, games are played that are
00:10:37 different from other games, yes I
00:10:40 remember when I was little, sometimes to
00:10:42 play a game we
00:10:45 had to take out the eights and the
00:10:48 months at 8 if the nines because
00:10:51 you
00:10:52 had a deck of 50  clear and 8 and
00:10:54 You had to remove the 9 of
00:10:56 course, of course, of course, so with the same
00:10:59 deck of 50 you can play all of them,
00:11:02 all of the games, it's like, but nothing to poker
00:11:06 because you have him, you don't have 10 and
00:11:11 jack, you have both, they are together in the
00:11:14 twelve cards  and there are thirteen there is nothing
00:11:17 for the 52 cards of course
00:11:20 and this is a fairly common design but
00:11:25 you have seen shuffled Spanish cards with
00:11:28 a different design
00:11:29 yes sometimes they are different if there is a
00:11:32 design maybe older older
00:11:33 for the impression of getting
00:11:36 older  but they are also beautiful,
00:11:39 I like them more interesting and well I
00:11:43 think that in another video we should
00:11:45 explain the games that are played here
00:11:48 in Spain I haven't done the card games
00:11:49 again okay so they will come let's
00:11:52 play mus

279,"00:00:00 Today I am going to explain the best way the
00:00:06 best way to learn to learn the
00:00:11 subjunctive hello do you know the subjunctive
00:00:22 not for example I
00:00:28 I eat I eat I eat well
00:00:33 what is what is the best way to
00:00:37 learn to learn the subjunctive well
00:00:43 the best way is  ignore it ignore it
00:00:49 sub with you with
00:00:51 you
00:00:53 ignore it yes
00:00:56 and well you who know me
00:01:01 who know this channel will know you will
00:01:06 know what I think I think that the
00:01:10 best thing is not to study
00:01:14 grammar no
00:01:17 and today I am going to explain why it
00:01:21 is better not to study  the grammar and if and
00:01:25 what do you have to do to learn to
00:01:27 learn the subjunctive and everything else
00:01:30 all the other things about the grammar
00:01:33 of Spanish
00:01:35 many people people people people who
00:01:40 learn Spanish who study Spanish
00:01:44 are worried
00:01:47 worried are they worried about
00:01:51 the subjunctive or are they worried about the c
00:01:57 o  they are worried in the past I did not eat
00:02:03 food and they are worried they are worried
00:02:08 because it is difficult
00:02:11 but it is difficult I really don't think so I don't
00:02:17 think so  that it is difficult it is difficult to
00:02:21 study it is difficult to take an exam
00:02:26 to take an exam not to
00:02:29 take an exam naifeh take because it is
00:02:33 difficult to study because many people
00:02:39 many people go to class not for a
00:02:42 class there is a teacher there is a teacher and
00:02:47 he tells them the  subjunctive comma the
00:02:50 subjunctive you have to use it in this
00:02:54 situation this situation here and here and
00:02:56 here and there are like 20 there are many
00:03:00 situations in which the subjunctive is used
00:03:03 and if you study it studying it
00:03:06 like this is difficult especially because if you
00:03:11 try to speak when you speak blah
00:03:15 blah blah when  are you talking are you thinking
00:03:19 about what you are saying if i'm
00:03:22 talking about going to the supermarket i'm
00:03:27 thinking about the supermarket i'm not thinking about it i'm
00:03:33 growing but i'm going to tell you a secret
00:03:39 the subjunctive
00:03:42 you don't need to understand it you do
00:03:46 n't need it you don't need to know why why  or
00:03:51 when when it is used it is not necessary to
00:03:55 know the subjunctive and the grammar the
00:04:00 grammar in general is not the same
00:04:05 we are going to change the color blue it is not the same
00:04:09 same
00:04:10 is not the same as mathematics
00:04:13 that one plus one is not the same as
00:04:18 dividing two by four
00:04:21 it is not the same mathematics you have to
00:04:26 understand it you
00:04:28 have to know why because one plus one
00:04:32 is two because the subjunctive and
00:04:37 grammar do not  You don't have to understand them, you have
00:04:40 to get used to it, you have to get
00:04:44 used to how we get used
00:04:48 to the light, the sunlight, the sun, the sun,
00:04:53 not when we leave the house, we leave the
00:04:57 house, our eyes, our eyes, and they hurt, but
00:05:02 later, later, we get used to it
00:05:08 when we go somewhere  dark to a
00:05:13 room
00:05:16 to a dark room very dark
00:05:20 also we don't see we don't see well but
00:05:25 the eyes get used to the eyes
00:05:31 get used to and we start we start to
00:05:34 see we start to see to see things we don't
00:05:38 start little by little we get used to
00:05:42 it well the grammar is the same  You don't have to
00:05:47 understand it, you have to
00:05:50 get used to it and when you
00:05:53 listen to Spanish aleix Spanish little by
00:05:59 little little by little you get
00:06:03 used to the grammar because you
00:06:07 will see it  you will see the subjunctive you will see it in
00:06:11 this situation you will see it in this
00:06:14 situation and little by little little by little it will
00:06:18 seem natural to you it will seem normal to you and
00:06:23 surely surely this video
00:06:28 this video is not the video
00:06:33 you were looking for but my
00:06:37 advice is what I advise you  is that the
00:06:42 best way the best way to learn
00:06:45 the subjunctive is to forget
00:06:51 forget the subjunctive forget the
00:06:55 pse forget the past

212,"00:00:00 I think you know that in Mexico,
00:00:05 in Mexico
00:00:08 , Spanish is spoken,
00:00:11 but I don't know, I don't know if you know that
00:00:16 there are many people in Mexico,
00:00:19 there are many people who speak other languages,
00:00:24 other languages ​​that are not Spanish
00:00:29 [Music]
00:00:36 Well, in 2016,
00:00:40 in 2016, I went to Mexico  i went to the
00:00:48 yucatan peninsula the yucatan in
00:00:51 mexico and i was surprised i was surprised to
00:00:57 hear people talking they were talking to each
00:01:01 other but they didn't speak spanish they spoke
00:01:05 a language i didn't understand
00:01:10 and they were speaking maya maya is the
00:01:15 language the language of the mayans the mayans
00:01:20 who  they lived in central america in the past
00:01:24 a long time ago maya is one of the
00:01:28 indigenous languages ​​of mexico indigenous
00:01:33 means that it was before it was
00:01:37 before it was already in mexico before we were
00:01:42 the spanish before the spanish
00:01:46 and europeans went to america there were
00:01:51 the  indigenous and before they were already
00:01:55 spoken many languages ​​were spoken in mexico
00:01:59 and before I believed that in mexico
00:02:04 indigenous languages ​​indigenous languages ​​were
00:02:08 spoken by very few people very  and few
00:02:13 people and in the mountains
00:02:17 in the mountains in towns in
00:02:21 small towns not in towns with houses houses
00:02:26 houses in small towns but no no there
00:02:31 are not many people in mexico who speak them
00:02:36 there are approximately 66 million
00:02:42 people 6 million 6 million
00:02:49 people who  they speak indigenous languages
00:02:53 that are not Spanish
00:02:56 and this is only in mexico only
00:03:01 in mexico yes yes in other countries of
00:03:05 central and south america there are more there are
00:03:08 more people who speak indigenous languages ​​and
00:03:12 these 6 million people
00:03:15 the languages ​​the languages ​​they speak the most
00:03:20 are  Nahuatl the ELN Aouate reads
00:03:26 Maya and
00:03:28 Yucatec Maya Yucatec Maya is what I read
00:03:32 today in Yucatan but now there are still
00:03:41 287 different languages ​​287
00:03:47 different languages ​​spoken in Mexico but
00:03:52 unfortunately a very
00:03:56 large part of these languages ​​are in danger
00:04:00 in the following decades in 2020 2030
00:04:09 2040
00:04:11 in the following decades
00:04:15 many of these languages ​​will surely be lost
00:04:21 and this happens because they last  indigenous languages ​​were banned
00:04:25 for a long time were
00:04:29 banned were banned
00:04:33 when mexico was owned by
00:04:38 spain when mexico was a colony of
00:04:41 spain for a long time they were
00:04:44 banned and then when mexico
00:04:49 when mexico gained independence
00:04:52 became independent from spain mexico the
00:04:58 government the  The Mexican government also
00:05:02 continued to prohibit indigenous languages
00:05:06 and education, schools
00:05:10 were only in Spanish,
00:05:14 so in the year 1820 there were 60
00:05:21 percent sixty percent of the
00:05:24 population of the people of Mexico who
00:05:28 spoke indigenous languages,
00:05:32 but now there are many  less now
00:05:36 only 6% not in 2018 only
00:05:44 6 percent of the people of the
00:05:48 inhabitants of mexico speak an
00:05:51 indigenous language because indigenous languages
00:05:55 are protected they are protected
00:06:00 only since 2003 in 2003
00:06:07 finally a law was passed a law was passed that
00:06:11 said  that indigenous languages ​​must be protected
00:06:13 and there are 68 68 of these languages
00:06:22 287 caught 68 who protected who have
00:06:28 said that it is necessary to protect and you in
00:06:33 your country
00:06:35 other languages ​​are spoken if a language is spoken
00:06:39 that is not the official one is not the one of the

",2
011,"00:00:00 Today with Maximiliano we are going to talk about
00:00:05 food, food, where
00:00:09 from Mexico, of course, from Mexico and because Maximiliano is
00:00:13 from Mexico
00:00:16 [Music]
00:00:20 Hello, hello, how are you, well, yes, Maximiliano has
00:00:25 come from Mexico and I want you to
00:00:30 tell us what food what food from Mexico  It is
00:00:35 the one you like the most the one you like better,
00:00:38 which is what you like
00:00:42 the most what I miss the most are the
00:00:45 clear al pastor tacos al pastor tacos al pastor
00:00:47 and the tacos that are the tacos first
00:00:50 we start well the tacos are a  Maybe I can
00:00:56 draw
00:00:58 to see if it turns out well, it's a
00:01:03 corn or flour tortilla, but for corn shepherds,
00:01:05 then with corn, not with
00:01:09 an ear of corn, we say the
00:01:11 hotel in Mexico is made
00:01:13 with corn, the tortilla is made
00:01:17 like this  it is and then there is one there is a
00:01:21 pork meat then with pork
00:01:26 with pork you make the meat the
00:01:30 pork meat for the taco for the taco and
00:01:33 you also put pineapple ojo pineapple if it is
00:01:37 serious if there is no other pastor without pineapple
00:01:40 with pineapple
00:01:43 oysters I like m  I like pineapple
00:01:47 I like pineapple but I feel that
00:01:50 people who eat pineapple with pizzas
00:01:53 must have a reserved place in
00:01:55 hell but no sorry in pizza
00:01:58 knox and without tongs but pizza no no but
00:02:01 in the tacos of the tacos it tastes good it
00:02:04 takes  green sauce I don't know what it's
00:02:09 made of but I think it has avocado from
00:02:11 a salsa sauce that dough that is
00:02:14 green is green but it's
00:02:19 not guacamole it's not guacamole goals but
00:02:22 I think it has avocado I really don't know
00:02:24 what it has if it does  avocado I think I
00:02:28 'm not sure and the red sauce I suppose
00:02:30 it has
00:02:32 a sauce a sauce also red red it's not
00:02:36 spicy it's spicy I think the truth
00:02:39 is the pica slightly more than the red I
00:02:41 know the green yes the truth and beds and beds
00:02:44 and something else  Cilantro
00:02:49 can never be missing, President, or
00:02:51 if cilantro is eaten a lot in Mexico, it
00:02:55 is eaten a lot here also in Thailand.
00:02:57 Yes, I am quite a fan of street food.
00:03:04 eva good the cake
00:03:09 the tortilla pineapple and pork and pork
00:03:14 that's delicious if it really sounds very good if it
00:03:17 's to go one day or one night and it
00:03:21 doesn't come true and if the next day you
00:03:24 can't wake up 0.26 if they're small I
00:03:28 really don't know  It's a drink, it's like that, more or
00:03:31 less, yes, but then it doubles, if it's doubled
00:03:33 or eaten, it's exact, but something that is
00:03:36 like that, but something I think is that the tacos
00:03:40 al pastor have a smaller tortilla than
00:03:43 these tacos that are called tacos for the
00:03:46 salvadores and other lips with pineapple pork
00:03:48 are tacos al pastor the tortilla is
00:03:51 smaller and more than in the other tacos it is
00:03:54 slightly and if you put cheese
00:03:58 it is called green gr
00:04:02 with cheese
00:04:07 also al pastor yes but with cheese yes and it
00:04:10 is gringa like that  They call him gringa, he's from the US,
00:04:14 no, no, that's no, but I think I know
00:04:19 what you're referring to, but he's not called
00:04:21 like that, but he doesn't come or doesn't come
00:04:24 from the US, they're not related,
00:04:30 well, I like tacos.
00:04:33 but i have never tasted tacos al pastor
00:04:37 tacos this way should is a d  I wonder
00:04:40 if I would have to try them when I go to
00:04:42 Mexico the problems that you
00:04:46 like to eat the enchiladas the most
00:04:50 the enchiladas are also a
00:04:53 very famous and well-known Mexican dish yes and I
00:04:56 really like that they have the enchiladas
00:04:57 well it's a tortilla also the
00:05:00 tortilla
00:05:01 too like that  or larger it is not the
00:05:04 same corn tortilla slightly
00:05:07 larger they are like tacos they sometimes put
00:05:12 cheese called Swiss cheese
00:05:15 and that is why it is called nechí la dea
00:05:17 suizas not because they come from Switzerland there is
00:05:18 a type of enchiladas that  They are Swiss enchiladas,
00:05:21 but they don't come from Switzerland, yes,
00:05:25 there wouldn't be, the cheese is the style 2,
00:05:28 miso comes, it's the Swiss style.
00:05:45 Exactly they put and they put
00:05:48 the sauce and cheese on top also cheese and
00:05:51 sauce and sauce
00:05:54 and other Mexican food
00:05:57 the burritos but but not the
00:06:00 American style burritos they are not the
00:06:02 style burritos in monterrey and they make  the burritos
00:06:06 that are with steak and cheese and avocado and
00:06:09 the compresses taste very good the
00:06:11 brainiacs I only know the
00:06:14 American burritos the American burritos that
00:06:16 teach covers and that
00:06:19 are taco bell no I don't know I haven't tried the
00:06:22 taco bell burritos but it is with a
00:06:25 bigger tortilla and they don't roll up no
00:06:28 and you eat like that if the stables the
00:06:31 burritos in mexico are also
00:06:33 like that rolled up and they are eaten like that as i
00:06:36 remember not at least in monterrey when
00:06:39 i was growing up food
00:06:42 in a different style of burrito which they
00:06:44 were with  this cheese avocado and
00:06:48 corn tortilla but they were not like the burritos
00:06:51 of song rice tacos the restaurant are
00:06:53 rice tacos has burritos but no they
00:06:56 were not they were not like those that are more
00:06:58 American ok then don't roll them up
00:07:01 the burritos no no no no
00:07:03 how they eat  Like a taco there's like a
00:07:05 taco but it's bigger good okay
00:07:08 then you put steak steak it's
00:07:11 good meat no chef a piece of meat
00:07:16 and
00:07:19 cheese sometimes but yes sometimes and water c  liz
00:07:23 avocado avocado you don't have a circle
00:07:25 like this half
00:07:28 like that no
00:07:30 avocado I like it I really like
00:07:34 avocado I like guacamole not with
00:07:37 avocado you make guacamole and then you
00:07:41 can dip
00:07:43 the so-called nachos born in Spain
00:07:47 we call them nachos but in  Mexico they are
00:07:50 called machos or they are called tortilla chips yes it is
00:07:53 true tortilla chips I also know
00:07:57 something that sometimes I go to the store and with
00:08:00 pro tortilla chips
00:08:02 but when I go to the movies they are called
00:08:04 nachos out of 100 access is the
00:08:07 dish they come tortilla chips with cheese sauce no
00:08:10 They are the nachos.
00:08:13 Yes, I think they would be very similar. When
00:08:17 I went to Mexico,
00:08:18 I got the impression that this was it. These
00:08:20 are tortilla chips and the plate with cheese and everything, they
00:08:24 were the machos, but in Spain
00:08:28 we call this triangles.
00:08:31 I think it was first.  the mole and then it
00:08:34 was the nachos but i'm not
00:08:35 entirely sure because the tortilla chips
00:08:38 were like tortilla chips you make
00:08:41 chilaquiles which is another mexican food
00:08:44 there are several dishes if you know
00:08:46 chilaquiles i heard i  I've heard the name
00:08:48 but I don't know what it is
00:08:50 if I'm not the chilaquiles maybe I'm
00:08:54 saying something wrong and someone is laughing I
00:08:56 mean it's wrong but if I remember well the
00:08:59 tortilla chips you can make them chilaquiles
00:09:04 but a plate with tortilla chips and more yes
00:09:10 and put chicken on them  beef or cheese
00:09:13 also sauce let's go to Mexican food it
00:09:16 has cheese and sauce
00:09:17 and that's a lot of cheese
00:09:22 there is one thing about Mexican food that
00:09:25 I really like and it's
00:09:30 mole mole is very different from what I've
00:09:33 tried  what Spanish food exists
00:09:35 in Spain what you
00:09:39 like mole yes of course six types of mole there is
00:09:41 red green mole and it is not like
00:09:44 blacker but I do like the one that tastes more like
00:09:47 chocolate and is spicy if it tastes like
00:09:50 chocolate  no because not much but
00:09:53 they put chocolate or cocoa they put
00:09:56 cocoa in it it's common like it's not
00:09:59 understood that it's a tasty something
00:10:01 similar to a sauce or a
00:10:04 really it doesn't even make the difference
00:10:06 between cocoa and coconut but I know they put it
00:10:08 some of that in chile ch  ile also
00:10:12 spicy chili yes I've tried them it wasn't
00:10:14 very spicy no music before so
00:10:17 well I can eat them but they also
00:10:19 put chili
00:10:22 and you can eat it with other things james
00:10:24 with chicken with chicken also nole with
00:10:27 chicken yes I think so  It is I think that with
00:10:31 chicken chilaquiles with the chilaquiles
00:10:34 that were the tortilla chips, the dish
00:10:38 made with tortilla chips is worth it. Yes, it is very
00:10:41 good. I recommend the mole
00:10:44 maximiliano.

00:10:56 favorite Mexican food

00:04:09 lucas broadway says college football
00:04:14 is what i follow the most i am still
00:04:17 learning about other sports
00:04:19 the spanish presenters always
00:04:22 seem much more excited much more
00:04:25 excited during a game than
00:04:30 some of the native
00:04:33 english speakers i have heard
00:04:36 throughout  over the years when there is
00:04:39 a football match when there is football
00:04:41 for example it is true that in
00:04:44 spain the announcers the people
00:04:49 the people who have a microphone and
00:04:54 speak speak on the radio
00:04:57 on the radio on the radio or on
00:05:00 television
00:05:03 is an announcer  and the Spanish announcers
00:05:07 get very excited run run run
00:05:11 from left to right pass goal
00:05:16 yes yes
00:05:18 so Lucas is talking about that
00:05:21 they get excited they put a lot of
00:05:24 energy in him
00:05:26 yes I think he's right I don't know I don't know
00:05:30 what those who speak English are like but yes they  It is
00:05:34 true that in Spain they are excited, the
00:05:38 next one is Chris Rey, that Kris Reyes is

00:05:44 says g  great video a little
00:05:48 correction english speakers usually
00:05:51 say native lawsuit instead of native y
00:05:54 because i made a video about how i
00:05:57 played football in a team when i was little
00:06:00 and i made a mistake with the
00:06:03 preposition i said and instead of on and if
00:06:09 the prepositions in on at
00:06:14 a japan in english the prepositions are
00:06:18 very difficult they
00:06:20 are difficult and now i speak english
00:06:23 very well but still with the
00:06:26 prepositions sometimes i make a mistake sometimes i
00:06:30 do it i do it wrong i do the

",2
081,"00:00:02 and that's it hello today I'm going to tell you 6
00:00:09 things
00:00:11 6 things
00:00:13 that surprise us Spaniards
00:00:15 [Music
00:00:16 ] Spanish people Spanish people are
00:00:21 surprised
00:00:22 about the US yes yes yes
00:00:26 6 things that surprise
00:00:30 us Spaniards about the US the first is
00:00:35 the death penalty when a judge
00:00:39 decides pan death penalty yes yes you have
00:00:45 the electric chair and the chair the electric chair
00:00:55 yes yes yes it
00:00:58 is quite amazing the fact that
00:01:03 a person
00:01:07 can be killed and a judge
00:01:13 a judge or a jury not a  jury
00:01:17 a jury decides if we are going to kill this
00:01:22 person
00:01:24 if we don't like him we don't like him
00:01:30 and I think that the majority of
00:01:35 Europeans is an idea that we don't understand
00:01:39 we don't understand the second thing
00:01:43 the second no this was the first
00:01:47 the  second are
00:01:52 weapons weapons like a pistol a pistol
00:01:57 pistols or even rifles no more big
00:02:01 rifles
00:02:05 yes yes yes
00:02:07 because in spain in spain if you hunt
00:02:14 hunt animals like deer you can
00:02:19 take a pet or not shotgun
00:02:22 shotguns yes
00:02:25 yes you can but given the pi  stolas or
00:02:29 rifles ta ta ta ta
00:02:32 no we don't understand why it
00:02:36 's a bit strange it's not strange the
00:02:40 third
00:02:42 3 the third is something that
00:02:47 surprised me when I went to the US
00:02:55 and it was in the supermarkets
00:02:58 in  a supermarket there are carts carts
00:03:03 with wheels in supermarkets there are
00:03:07 some chairs it's like a chair it
00:03:11 's like a chair with wheels with wheels
00:03:14 that you can drive

00:03:17 that works with a battery
00:03:21 not with a battery
00:03:24 yes yes yes
00:03:26 and for people I think it's for  people who
00:03:29 are very fat or who are old old people
00:03:35 p
00:03:37 but me the people the people I saw using
00:03:43 this fat people yes I was
00:03:47 surprised and if the fourth thing the fourth thing
00:03:54 is drinks or drinks like coca-cola
00:03:59 fanta
00:04:02 when you go
00:04:04 to mcdonald's  burger king
00:04:07 you can drink
00:04:10 and it's over you take it again the full one
00:04:16 and babies

00:04:23 and babies as
00:04:25 many times as you want all yes yes

00:04:30 and you don't have to pay more you don't pay
00:04:34 money with dollars they don't have dollars
00:04:37 dollars you pay one  time and until  a and then you
00:04:42 fill it up you drink it you fill it up babies
00:04:47 but there are various sizes there are small
00:04:54 medium

00:05:03 the price is different for example one
00:05:08 dollar
00:05:11 72 10

00:05:18 but let's see
00:05:22 I can buy the small one for only one
00:05:25 dollar 70 and then I fill it up
00:05:32 and that's it  Why pay more for the big one you

00:04:47 very well very well come next the
00:04:50 second the second movie is is about
00:04:55 an animal is an animal is an animal this
00:05:00 animal is  different is different from those
00:05:05 of the others yes yes it is different that's why
00:05:09 the others the other animals the other
00:05:12 animals marginalize it they don't want to be
00:05:16 friends friends they don't want to be so
00:05:20 no they are not together they separate they are not
00:05:23 together they separate no no they do not want to  they
00:05:27 don't want to

00:05:48 the animal and the mother not the  animal tie  ne
00:05:53 a
00:05:54 a mother the mother of the animal protects it she

00:06:32 then everyone
00:06:35 is very impressed with what this

00:04:06 then you put it in a toaster and it jumps and it's
00:04:12 toasted ok and he doesn't  You had a bet like this
00:04:17 toast and with what you eat it you put
00:04:21 butter or jam or what
00:04:23 butter sometimes I like to only
00:04:26 eat them only bread is worth it sometimes
00:04:29 only bread and other times it doesn't bother you
00:04:32 and that's it if it's worth it in Mexico people
00:04:37 eat jam  spread jam on the
00:04:39 bread it's okay but you don't like it yes yes
00:04:43 I like it but in your house you don't eat a
00:04:46 lot of jam

00:04:52 jam in your house but it
00:04:55 is sometimes but more the fruit is
00:04:59 worth there was more  fruit like this whole fruit
00:05:02 a cut and if now it comes
00:05:06 and part that is they did not do it

00:05:07 there was an exam of
00:05:10 course you guys will be
00:05:14 thinking clearly Pablo  because the exam the

00:05:37 an exam a written exam an exam in which you
00:05:41 had to write and the exam  The
00:05:45 written exam went well I passed
00:05:51 I passed the written exam my
00:05:56 problem was the practical exam the
00:06:00 practical exam is an exam it is not an
00:06:04 exam where you do not have to write it is an
00:06:09 exam where you have to do things to
00:06:12 put bandages put bandages  for example, do not
00:06:17 put bandages or bandages yes yes and I
00:06:23 knew how to do it how to put the bandages
00:06:26 but you have to do it very quickly you have to
00:06:30 be very fast in the exam if you don't
00:06:33 do it  they suspend you quickly they suspend you
00:06:39 no they don't approve you not because of an efe
00:06:43 suspended or here in spain not here but
00:06:47 in spain we don't use the efe it would be a zero
00:06:53 a 4 would be suspended
00:06:58 and they suspended me because
00:07:01 I didn't bandage the bandages quickly  yes
00:07:07 then I was sad because I
00:07:12 didn't get I didn't get the
00:07:16 lifeguard card I didn't get the
00:07:19 first aid card no because I failed
00:07:23 the exam
00:07:26 and I'm thinking maybe about the future in
00:07:31 the future again do it take the
00:07:35 exam the exam to be  lifeguard
00:07:38 but in different places in different
00:07:43 countries it is different it
00:07:48 works differently
00:07:50 yes so I don't know I don't know if I will be able to if it
00:07:54 will be possible in the future to do it but it
00:07:57 may still be now I like I
00:08:02 like to swim swim I like to dive
00:08:07 is that
00:08:09 and you you have ever

00:00:14 the differences the differences between
00:00:19 barcelona between here here we are in
00:00:23 barcelona between barcelona and the place
00:00:27 where he grew up where he lived as a
00:00:30 child that  It is in Gran Canaria in the
00:00:35 Canary Islands
00:00:37 [Music]
00:00:42 Well, explain to us what
00:00:46 the difference was, the biggest difference
00:00:49 when Barcelona ministers, well, the biggest
00:00:53 difference that I noticed in the
00:00:58 Canary Islands is a place, well, tiny, the
00:01:01 cities are
00:01:04 tiny compared to Barcelona, ​​which is a
00:01:06 big  biggest city yes very big
00:01:09 here there are a lot of people
00:01:12 there are so many places a
00:01:16 lot a lot of people from different
00:01:19 places move around that is first here barcelona is
00:01:24 a city a big very big city in
00:01:27 gran canaria there are no cities there are
00:01:30 cities sometimes green they are tiny more more
00:01:32 smaller ones okay and there are many people here
00:01:35 yes and from many places okay people there are
00:01:40 many many people and in addition to many
00:01:43 places  that come from many
00:01:46 places it is not currently and in gran
00:01:50 canaria there are no people who come
00:01:53 yes there are people from other places but they
00:01:56 are not with such a variety ok there are not
00:02:00 so many different people different
00:02:02 exactly like here in barcelona exactly
00:02:07 the food is different  who eats says in the
00:02:11 canary islands there is something different if
00:02:15 we eat there well rather stews that we
00:02:19 call it that is like stew yes because it is
00:02:23 like a soup yes exactly of the people if
00:02:26 this were a pot it is not valid with a pot
00:02:30 except very well then well that
00:02:34 With vegetables like that, it's fine with vegetables, yes, that's
00:02:39 exactly fine, and we also eat a lot of
00:02:43 wrinkled potatoes, for example, because they're
00:02:46 like beans, but before they're potatoes,
00:02:49 potatoes, potatoes, because that's how we say
00:02:52 potatoes and add color. Arias, they're the
00:02:54 potatoes.
00:02:57 the way it is spoken there are
00:02:59 speakers a little different if it is spoken
00:03:02 differently for example la la s
00:03:07 we to the canaries when we talk
00:03:11 about the last s la short we see  at the end
00:03:15 at the end of the word if you don't say
00:03:18 canaries if we say from the stage
00:03:21 then we absorb it instead of saying
00:03:23 for example we we and since we
00:03:27 are not heard we are not heard we are
00:03:30 heard very little we see each other
00:03:34 and sorry for interrupting you every
00:03:38 food days yes well when I speak to
00:03:42 so many with crises potatoes
00:03:44 wrinkled potatoes potatoes
00:03:49 actually that which are wrinkled if they
00:03:52 are smaller like that smaller
00:03:54 exactly these are like potatoes not just
00:03:57 like tiny potatoes
00:03:58 like that and they kind of wrinkle and they are like that it
00:04:10 is  a very typical food from there,
00:04:14 such as gofio, cof, I
00:04:19 had never heard of that before. Advertisement You have
00:04:21 the vegetable menu, continue to see if it comes out.
00:04:35 maize cornmeal but this one
00:04:39 grinds the corn and makes it into flour and it is
00:04:41 toasted a little while still with a little it is
00:04:44 given a little bit of heat it is toasted
00:04:46 with the fire it is not the egg
00:04:49 effectively it is toasted to touch and  crazy
00:04:51 without and you eat like that with a spoon
00:04:59 no you don't eat with one with a
00:05:02 tablespoon
00:05:07 like dried up with milk with milk
00:05:11 ok ok ok or you even catch it sometimes
00:05:15 you catch the goiter and put it in the stew
00:05:18 inside yes oysters and  It is mixed and it is very
00:05:23 nutritious, it is mixed with well, I did not know
00:05:26 that in the Canary Islands it is when here in the
00:05:28 Canary Islands I eat a lot of corn, yes,
00:05:33 like me, and then as big as a mille.
00:05:36 We
00:05:37 call it corn and in the Canaries we call it
00:05:40 millo, you don't call it corn  twice a
00:05:43 thousand thousand and in this word it is different
00:05:45 different in the Canary Islands very well very
00:05:47 interesting and there are more words more
00:05:51 words that are said
00:05:53 differently in the Canary Islands if we have the
00:05:57 balloons that are called balloons here okay and

00:06:13 blow really blow decide to blow of course you
00:06:17 blow

00:06:23 actually well I
00:06:25 had never heard of this either  It is already very much from the Canary Islands
00:06:28 from the Canary Islands it would be worth another different word then
00:06:33 the buckets that are as if they are worth
00:06:36 like this but like a glass but made of
00:06:38 large metal a glass but large yes and made of
00:06:42 metal yes

00:07:03 then another different word is the
00:07:08 buses that they have on the bus yes there it is
00:07:11 so I know it that's it I think it's
00:07:13 here  also in the peninsula it is known
00:07:17 if the buses are a very good bus
00:07:21 because there we call it wah wah wah wah
00:07:25 like a crazy dog ​​crazy like a puppy

00:07:35 some words have canaries we say
00:07:38 differently  the peninsula oysters very well
00:07:40 how interesting really how curious
00:07:44 and there is one thing that I know is
00:07:47 different and it is the weather if it is the
00:07:51 seasons no
00:07:54 what difference is there in the canaries in the
00:07:57 canaries there is only summer yes l  the summers
00:08:01 ago only summer it is not that there is no
00:08:06 winter it is not cold it
00:08:08 is different that we have spring

00:08:36 that winter is warmer, if
00:08:40 not, it's not so bad,
00:08:42 Claviero, it's so cold.
00:08:52 the
00:08:57 highest part that there is and that snow falls yes
00:08:59 snow does fall but only in the
00:09:03 mountains is it Christian the mountain is very good
00:09:08 yes and then in the canaries it is not very
00:09:12 cold maybe it can rivers can be
00:09:15 14 degrees for example ok
00:09:19 but since there is so much humidity  in the
00:09:22 very humid air it gets into your bones and
00:09:26 then you feel the cold
00:09:28 but it's not there it's not as cold
00:09:32 as here that you can get to the
00:09:33 best in the morning
00:09:35 to a degree yes here in barcelona yes in
00:09:39 winter a lot  sometimes it's a degree in

017,"00:00:00 In this video I am going to talk to you about
00:00:05 drugs the most consumed drugs
00:00:09 in Spain and in Europe
00:00:14 you know what they are
00:00:17 watch this video
00:00:21 [Music]
00:00:24 or Spain
00:00:28 Spain is the gateway
00:00:33 to Europe
00:00:35 for many different
00:00:40 drugs many drugs come to Europe from
00:00:45 Spain and
00:00:48 the  most widely consumed drug
00:00:51 in europe and spain
00:00:56 and cannabis cannabis in spain
00:01:00 this drug is consumed in the form of hashish
00:01:06 this is hashish it is a drug that is
00:01:12 made from cannabis
00:01:17 from this plant it is made from the resin
00:01:21 or pollen of  the cannabis plant
00:01:27 makes a brown paste that
00:01:32 is shaped, it can be a square shape
00:01:37 like a brick or a round shape
00:01:43 if that is hashish and hashish is a
00:01:49 drug that is smoked if it is mixed with
00:01:53 tobacco and  smokes like a cigar
00:01:58 is the most common drug in spain the most
00:02:03 consumed in spain and reaches this
00:02:09 country through morocco
00:02:12 morocco is the country where
00:02:18 hashish is manufactured hashish is a
00:02:21 drug that is easy to transport it is m  Easier
00:02:25 to transport to take from one place to
00:02:30 another Easier than the plant Easier
00:02:34 than the marijuana bud If it is more
00:02:38 resistant and easier to transport
00:02:43 then some drug
00:02:46 traffickers swallow
00:02:49 the drug They swallow the hashish to
00:02:54 transport it from Morocco to
00:02:57 Spain  the hashish is swallowed in it in
00:03:02 little round balls with this shape that are
00:03:06 called acorns yes and later when they
00:03:12 are in spain they take laxatives these
00:03:16 drug traffickers
00:03:18 take laxatives to expel the hashish and
00:03:23 sell it part of this hashish is sold
00:03:28 in spain and part of the hashish is
00:03:34 it transports to the rest of europe hashish
00:03:38 also arrives from morocco to
00:03:41 spain in boats and it can be in
00:03:47 boats or in
00:03:52 recreational
00:03:54 boats recreational boats morocco is very very
00:03:59 close to spain and this type of
00:04:04 drug trafficking is super common in spain
00:04:09 sometimes
00:04:12 boats with  the hash with the hash
00:04:16 arrive in
00:04:18 broad daylight during the day you can
00:04:21 see the boats arriving at the
00:04:25 boats arriving with  n hashish
00:04:29 but this is not legal if hashish is
00:04:33 an illegal drug in spain
00:04:36 normally the hashish arrives through the area
00:04:41 of ​​the strait of gibraltar
00:04:44 if the ships arrive from morocco
00:04:48 to the strait of gibraltar but
00:04:53 there are a lot of police at one point then
00:04:59 the
00:05:00 drug traffickers  they go to other ports to
00:05:04 other parts to unload the
00:05:09 drug in spain the people who are
00:05:13 dedicated to selling the drug in small quantities
00:05:19 sell it to the people who want to
00:05:22 consume that drug are called camels the
00:05:27 camel is an animal but it is also a
00:05:32 person who sells  drug in small
00:05:36 quantities the second most widely consumed drug
00:05:41 in europe
00:05:43 after hashish or after
00:05:47 marijuana after cannabis
00:05:51 is cocaine cocaine arrives in spain
00:05:57 from
00:05:59 latin american countries such as colombia arrives by
00:06:03 boat in the 80s in the 80s
00:06:11 cocaine  used to arrive at the ports of
00:06:16 galicia in galicia there were
00:06:20 drug trafficking clans like drug
00:06:25 trafficking families that collaborated  even with
00:06:30 the
00:06:32 colombian drug traffickers
00:06:34 with the
00:06:36 mexican drug traffickers during this
00:06:40 decade during the 80s in spain there was a
00:06:45 boom an increase in the consumption of
00:06:51 hard drugs drugs like cocaine and then a
00:06:55 lot of that drug
00:06:57 arrived in galicia later with time
00:07:02 many big galician drug traffickers
00:07:09 were taken  to prison if they were
00:07:13 sentenced to prison
00:07:15 and the Galician mafias
00:07:22 dissolved then after that the
00:07:26 drug from Latin America the cocaine
00:07:31 began to arrive through the south of
00:07:36 the southern ports such as ports like the
00:07:40 port of algeciras
00:07:42 if the port of algeciras
00:07:45 receives
00:07:47 many  cargo ships with
00:07:51 very large containers with all kinds of merchandise
00:07:56 and food
00:07:59 fish fruit and cocaine
00:08:05 hide if in those ships those ships
00:08:10 with containers if the cocaine is
00:08:15 hidden in the
00:08:17 containers
00:08:19 of these ships in spain there are also
00:08:24 organizations dedicated to cultivating
00:08:30 marijuana if
00:08:35 there are marijuana
00:08:39 plantations inside the houses  legal inside houses and in these
00:08:45 houses marijuana is cultivated, processed
00:08:49 , packaged, packaged, and
00:08:54 then transported, transported to
00:09:00 different parts of Europe, other drugs such
00:09:05 as
00:09:07 heroin are currently not
00:09:12 widely consumed in Spain, they are
00:09:17 minority drugs  But sometimes they come to
00:09:21 Spain,
00:09:22 especially from Eastern
00:09:26 Asian countries and sometimes from
00:09:31 Latin American countries.
00:09:32 In Spain there is a serious
00:09:37 problem with
00:09:39 drug trafficking because it is a country that
00:09:43 receives a lot of drugs that are eventually
00:09:49 distributed throughout Europe
00:09:54 and in your  country
00:09:56 is drug trafficking a
00:09:59 major problem tell me in the comments see

209,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk to you about the Basque Country, the
00:00:05 Basque Country, and what the
00:00:10 Spanish think about what we
00:00:14 Spanish think about the Basques
00:00:19 [Music]
00:00:24 Well, in Spain there are several
00:00:29 regions, several regions, and there is a
00:00:34 historical region that is the Basque Country.
00:00:38 It is more or less this area
00:00:42 and is today the communities of the
00:00:47 Basque Country Navarra or part of Navarra and
00:00:52 the French Basque Country a part is in
00:00:56 France in France and it is a region in
00:01:02 which another language is spoken the Basque language is spoken
00:01:06 or Euskera and it is a language
00:01:10 that was already spoken here 2000 years ago
00:01:15 in year zero in year zero for example
00:01:19 not year zero after Christ
00:01:23 there is no one there is no year zero
00:01:26 for example in year 1
00:01:29 in year 1  Basque was already spoken
00:01:33 here
00:01:37 although nowadays the
00:01:41 most widely spoken language in this region in Spain
00:01:45 at least is
00:01:48 Spanish Spanish is spoken more than Basque
00:01:52 but they are trying to protect they are
00:01:56 trying to protect Basque so that  don't
00:02:00 miss so you don't  Basque disappears
00:02:05 there are schools
00:02:08 there are schools that
00:02:12 teach in Basque they use Basque to
00:02:15 teach
00:02:17 and the Basque language is completely
00:02:21 different completely different from
00:02:25 Spanish what we speak in Spain is
00:02:29 different from Basque Basque was already
00:02:34 here before we  Latin
00:02:38 came before the Romans came, they already
00:02:42 spoke Basque
00:02:45 and even we in Spanish have
00:02:49 words, we have some words that
00:02:53 come from Basque, such as
00:02:56 left, we don't have a right hand or a
00:03:01 left hand because the word left
00:03:04 comes from Basque and the word mochila
00:03:09 mochila too  it comes from the basque and
00:03:14 also in the basque country there is a part
00:03:18 of the population there is a percentage of the
00:03:22 population that wants the basque country to
00:03:25 be independent to be independent to be
00:03:31 separated from the rest of spain
00:03:35 and even in the past there was terrorism
00:03:39 there were terrorists terrorists who
00:03:42 killed  people shot they planted bombs they
00:03:48 planted bombs they did not make explosions it was
00:03:53 separate terrorism  Tista terrorism
00:03:57 who wanted the Basque country to be
00:03:59 independent and luckily now
00:04:04 today there is no longer terrorism they no longer
00:04:07 kill people the terrorists were a
00:04:12 group called eta they were called eta
00:04:16 and they lasted from 1959 from 1959 to
00:04:25 2011 in 2011  They said they were giving up they were
00:04:31 giving up violence that they weren't going
00:04:35 to kill people anymore they weren't going to use violence
00:04:41 recently not very recently until
00:04:43 recently there was still terrorism but
00:04:47 in the Basque country they also have
00:04:50 very good things very good
00:04:55 cooking the country's food  Basque is very good
00:04:59 we eat it a lot also in the rest of
00:05:02 Spain 'in the rest of Spain' we eat
00:05:05 pinchos the pinchos are Basque and in the
00:05:10 Basque country they also have their own
00:05:13 sports they have sports that are unique
00:05:17 in the Basque country for example Basque ball
00:05:22 Basque pelota is played against
00:05:25 a wall against a wall It is similar
00:05:29 to fronton Do you know the fronton that is
00:05:33 played with a racket with a
00:05:37 racket with a racket and a ball and
00:05:42 a peg  lota throws itself against a wall and
00:05:45 to bounce back well in Basque pelota they
00:05:49 also use rackets but they
00:05:53 also use their hands yes yes with their hands
00:05:56 to hit the ball
00:06:01 and in the Basque country there are also
00:06:05 rural sports sports of the towns
00:06:11 of the towns
00:06:14 no villages are small places and
00:06:19 rural sports include things like
00:06:23 chopping cutting logs no trees
00:06:29 trees have trunks they have to
00:06:34 cut a log
00:06:36 or lift
00:06:39 stones a stone lift a stone
00:06:45 or cut cut with a saw with a
00:06:51 saw also cut a log  And me, yes,
00:06:57 the Basques have these sports,
00:07:01 that's why the rest of the Spaniards, the
00:07:05 Spaniards, think that the Basques are
00:07:09 very strong, they are very strong, I don't know, I don't know
00:07:13 if it's true or not, and
00:07:17 you, your country, there are stereotypes and
00:07:22 clichés.  things that other
00:07:27 people foreigners think are true
00:07:31 of your country that are
00:07:34 cliché stereotypes what things what things are
00:07:37 tell me below in the comments val

00:01:51 Spain the Emperor
00:01:53 paid the money for Magellan's voyage a
00:01:58 few years later in
00:02:06 1565 the
00:02:08 Spanish began to
00:02:12 settle in the
00:02:14 Philippines and in the Philippines  there were many
00:02:19 different towns
00:02:22 when the spanish came to the
00:02:25 philippines in the philippines there were many different
00:02:29 towns
00:02:32 with different languages
00:02:34 with different cultures
00:02:38 so the spanish
00:02:41 used the catholic religion the catholic religion
00:02:48 to unify all the
00:02:54 native peoples to make all the peoples
00:02:58 more similar they used the
00:03:03 catholic religion but in the philippines there were not
00:03:08 many missionaries there were not many
00:03:11 missionaries and they did not  they could teach
00:03:19 Spanish to so many people to so many
00:03:24 towns so the missionaries
00:03:28 learned the native languages ​​of those
00:03:33 towns
00:03:35 teach them
00:03:37 Christianity through the
00:03:41 native languages ​​and not through Spanish little by
00:03:46 little over the
00:03:51 years Spanish the Spanish language spread  It was
00:03:55 returning to the language of the upper classes
00:04:01 of the people with more money the
00:04:05 upper classes Spanish was also the
00:04:10 language of the government of politics but
00:04:15 the lower classes the people with
00:04:20 less money the people never
00:04:24 learned Spanish Spanish was never the
00:04:30 language of the  town was never the language of
00:04:36 the popular classes in the year
00:04:42 1898 there was a war  rra
00:04:46 between spain and the united states and this year
00:04:55 spain lost the philippines philippines
00:05:00 became a us territory
00:05:28 they had to
00:05:33 learn english in schools and the
00:05:39 spanish language spanish was a
00:05:43 minority language an
00:05:47 important language for the
00:05:51 media for the
00:05:55 media spanish was
00:05:58 still an important language
00:06:02 in the year
00:06:03 [Music]
00:06:05 1946 the
00:06:07 philippines gain their
00:06:10 independence from the usa
00:06:14 The Philippines
00:06:15 begins to be an independent country
00:06:19 but the Filipinos
00:06:22 establish English
00:06:25 as the lingua franca,
00:06:28 the Filipinos use English to
00:06:33 communicate between the different peoples
00:06:38 of the country because in the Philippines there were and are
00:06:44 different languages,
00:06:46 so the Filipinos began to
00:06:50 use English as the language  of the
00:06:55 American colonizers as a language  franca as a
00:07:00 language to communicate between different
00:07:04 peoples at present at present
00:07:08 only
00:07:09 3 percent of the Filipino population
00:07:14 speak Spanish as a second language as a
00:07:19 second language but although most
00:07:23 people do not speak Spanish in the Philippines
00:07:27 the Spanish language has a lot of
00:07:31 influence in some
00:07:36 important languages ​​of the Philippines, for example,
00:07:41 the most important and most spoken language in the
00:07:45 Philippines is Tagalog and Tagalog has
00:07:51 30% of words in Spanish,
00:07:56 there is even a language, Chabacano, which has
00:08:03 70% of words in Spanish,
00:08:07 although the grammar and form  to
00:08:12 write
00:08:13 very differently as a conclusion we can
00:08:17 say that Spanish was never a
00:08:22 main language of the Philippines but
00:08:28 it has had a lot of influence on
00:08:32 some languages ​​that are spoken in this
00:08:37 country. Tell me in the comments if you

00:01:30 balls in the hole, it's a
00:01:34 bit similar to golf, like golf,
00:01:38 but without golf clubs,
00:01:43 there are no golf clubs, and you have to
00:01:46 put the marbles in the hole to
00:01:50 put them in the hole they are caught like this

00:02:07 marble and he throws them, we go like this, we did like this
00:02:14 and to put it in the hole, for example,
00:02:17 with our little finger we put it on the
00:02:19 ground
00:02:22 and they collided with each other. If we had
00:02:27 a ball here and we wanted to put it here,

00:10:54 footballer like messi like cristiano
00:10:59 ronaldo yes yes then the girls the
00:11:03 girls
00:11:05 the girls come alone they come alone if
00:11:08 you don't have to go talk to girls
00:11:12 no no  no, the girls come,
00:11:16 what do you think, is that true or did they not
00:11:20 set fire to the neighborhood club that
00:11:22 trains vital

00:12:02 player player
00:12:05 and this  seal happens to and that is the one you
00:12:11 have seen is curro curro of the
00:12:14 brothers of the three brothers is the
00:12:17 little brother
00:12:19 in my neighborhood and he will recognize me because
00:12:22 I am always going for something to curro
00:12:25 curro says if you see me in my neighborhood in the
00:12:30 neighborhood in the  street not
00:12:33 to the street with houses
00:12:36 houses houses
00:12:40 this is the neighborhood of work and if you see
00:12:44 work
00:12:46 on the street
00:12:48 you will know that it is work or not
00:12:51 because there is a way to know and that is
00:12:55 work yes yes because work always
00:12:58 always will  for something he always goes to
00:13:01 buy something at a store
00:13:06 not a store
00:13:09 and work takes money
00:13:14 and goes to the store to buy give me bread for
00:13:19 example bread
00:13:22 give me bread and then come back home
00:13:25 like this to
00:13:28 see for the corduroy for the newspaper for
00:13:33 pipas back work goes to the store  to contribute to
00:13:39 the newspaper
00:13:45 the newspaper to for pipes no pipes
00:13:52 yes yes
00:13:55 yes I don't care I know that I am the victim of
00:13:57 a series of fatal circumstances
00:14:00 says work I don't care I don't
00:14:04 care I'm going for bread for him
00:14:07 newspaper for pipes yes yes
00:14:11 they are basically reduced to being
00:14:13 born last and the reason
00:14:17 why I always work always goes
00:14:21 for the corduroy for the newspaper for pipes
00:14:23 is because it is the smallest it is not the
00:14:26 largest or the medium  No, he's not the little one,
00:14:30 that's why he always has to go for the
00:14:33 corduroy, for the newspaper, for pipes,
00:14:36 and for today, that's it, but it's been
00:14:40 a bit long, next time
00:14:43 we'll continue, we'll continue to meet

262,"00:00:00 it is not good to compare yourself with other
00:00:05 people
00:00:10 no people
00:00:12 and other people sometimes have more
00:00:17 money they
00:00:20 have more money
00:00:24 or are more handsome than us
00:00:30 but to compare yourself to them
00:00:36 is not good no no
00:00:39 but sometimes we compare ourselves sometimes
00:00:44 we compare ourselves with others  Others
00:00:48 with other people
00:00:53 and sometimes the Spaniards
00:00:58 the Spaniards compare ourselves with other
00:01:03 people in Europe with other countries other
00:01:08 countries in Europe
00:01:12 and sometimes we feel
00:01:18 ashamed we feel ashamed when we compare ourselves
00:01:23 today I am going to explain six reasons six
00:01:29 reasons six reasons why sometimes
00:01:35 some Spaniards feel ashamed
00:01:42 [Music]
00:01:47 good
00:01:49 we feel ashamed well yes sometimes
00:01:55 some some Spaniards feel
00:01:59 ashamed it's not everyone no no
00:02:04 but sometimes sometimes you hear it in Spain you
00:02:10 hear people to people saying oops in Spain
00:02:16 we're
00:02:18 wrong sometimes I hear  to friends I hear relatives
00:02:25 who complain they complain or we are very
00:02:29 bad yes yes and I don't I don't complain
00:02:34 much I don't complain no  I complain a
00:02:38 lot I don't like
00:02:42 it I don't like it I don't like being negative
00:02:47 think negatively no I don't like to
00:02:52 say say negative things but in
00:02:58 Spain sometimes I hear I hear people I hear
00:03:04 people who are ashamed they are
00:03:08 ashamed to be Spanish when  they
00:03:11 compare themselves with other countries but why
00:03:17 because because they are ashamed because they are
00:03:21 ashamed well
00:03:23 the first reason
00:03:28 the first reason why they feel
00:03:31 ashamed is because sometimes the
00:03:35 Spaniards the Spaniards when we are
00:03:41 on a plane
00:03:43 we are on a plane
00:03:48 we are on a plane and  the plane lands
00:03:55 the plane lands
00:03:58 the Spaniards the Spaniards applaud
00:04:05 yes sometimes sometimes some Spaniards
00:04:09 applaud when the plane lands even
00:04:15 though we haven't died
00:04:22 it seems funny to me it's funny it's
00:04:27 hahaha it's funny but there are people who
00:04:33 are embarrassed they are embarrassed
00:04:38 the second reason the second reason is
00:04:43 that in spain in spain to be a
00:04:47 waiter to be a waiter
00:04:52 in spain to be a waiter you have to
00:04:56 speak english you have  to
00:05:00 speak english
00:05:04 you have to know how to speak english to be a
00:05:07 waiter to be a waiter in many
00:05:10 places in spain you have to know how to speak
00:05:14 english but to be president of the
00:05:19 government not to be president of the
00:05:23 government of spain you don't need to know how to
00:05:27 speak english no no and some some  of
00:05:32 our past presidents did not speak
00:05:35 any English
00:05:38 that is why in spain in spain there are people
00:05:44 there are people who say spain country of
00:05:50 tambourine country of tambourine country of
00:05:55 tambourine like the instrument the
00:06:00 musical instrument the tambourine and that
00:06:05 means that in spain we are not
00:06:11 serious  that there are people outside of Spain'
00:06:17 there are people
00:06:19 who laugh who laugh at us because
00:06:24 we are a country with a tambourine other
00:06:29 reasons other reasons why there are
00:06:34 people who are ashamed
00:06:38 are politics social
00:06:47 policies health policies not education
00:06:52 health education social policies
00:06:56 of society we always
00:07:00 compare ourselves we compare ourselves with
00:07:03 scandinavia  with the countries
00:07:07 we compare ourselves with scandinavia with the
00:07:11 scandinavian countries not with sweden with
00:07:16 norway with denmark and we also
00:07:19 compare ourselves with finland
00:07:22 we always look at them and think that they
00:07:27 do things much better much better
00:07:31 than us
00:07:33 -spain country of tambourine
00:07:37 another reason
00:07:39 another reason is  that in Spain you live a
00:07:43 lot from the tourism of the tourism of the
00:07:48 tourists that come from Germany from the
00:07:53 United Kingdom from France Holland Holland Holland

00:08:20 vegetables we sell it to the rest of europe they
00:08:25 are businesses they are jobs they are industries
00:08:30 that are good but it seems there are people there are
00:08:36 people who think they are not very very

00:02:58 's flamenco quite normal, quite
00:03:02 traditional, the same as flamenco
00:03:07 from before, but the second, the second
00:03:11 album mixes flamenco with hip hop, or
00:03:17 rather more than hip hop, it's trap trap, which is
00:03:21 modern music, not urban music.
00:03:26 urban from the city an urban music and
00:03:30 its latest album the second album is an
00:03:35 album
00:03:36 that is like a book it is like a book it is
00:03:41 a book it is like a book because each
00:03:46 song not each song each song on the
00:03:51 album
00:03:53 is like a chapter of the book the  books
00:03:56 have chapters chapter 1 chapter 2
00:04:01 etc. and the songs are the
00:04:05 chapters and the record the record talks
00:04:11 about a bad relationship about a girl

00:04:23 very very bad relationship with a man with
00:04:27 a bad man a man who does
00:04:30 bad things badly done and the first song the

00:05:36 [Music]
00:05:40 the food that she looks at riveted
00:05:44 p
00:05:46 [Music]
00:05:50 Well, Rosalía Rosalía is from
00:05:55 near Barcelona, ​​not near Barcelona, ​​and
00:06:01 Rosalía is young, she is still small, not
00:06:05 very small, she is 25 years old, she is 25 years old, she was
00:06:11 born and  she was born in 1993
00:06:19 but rosalía didn't go out not
00:06:24 at home at home she didn't listen to
00:06:28 flamenco no no at home she didn't
00:06:31 listen to flamenco but rosalía when
00:06:35 rosalía was 13 when she was 13
00:06:40 she
00:06:40 listened to the flamenco of her friends  Others her
00:06:45 friends listened to flamenco and Rosalía became
00:06:50 interested she began to like it
00:06:56 she began to like flamenco
00:07:02 and Rosalía began to study she began to
00:07:08 study music to study music to
00:07:12 study flamenco too Rosalía
00:07:15 decided to become a musician to dedicate herself to
00:07:20 singing to writing music
00:07:23 Rosalía did not want to  do another job I
00:07:27 didn't want to do any work any
00:07:31 job that wasn't a musician and rosalía
00:07:36 when they interview rosalía
00:07:39 they do an interview they ask her
00:07:42 questions you can see that rosalía knows a
00:07:48 lot she's very intelligent you can see
00:07:52 she knows a lot she knows  a lot of music
00:07:56 but also when I went out to talk to
00:08:00 her friends she talks to her friends
00:08:06 it is also seen that she is a normal person
00:08:10 like you and like me she is a
00:08:13 quite
00:08:15 normal person with a super nervous girl and a difference
00:08:26 there
00:08:27 is no difference between how rosalía
00:08:31 talks like  she speaks it speaks speaks and
00:08:35 how she sings yes yes and the difference is the
00:08:40 accent when she speaks she speaks with an accent
00:08:44 from Spain' an accent is  pañol quite
00:08:49 neutral quite standard quite normal
00:08:53 but when she sings when she sings she sings with
00:08:58 an Andalusian accent with an Andalusian accent
00:09:02 with an accent from the south of Spain and I think this
00:09:07 is because the Andalusian accent the Andalusian way
00:09:12 of speaking is very
00:09:15 integrated with flamenco very integrated
00:09:20 with  certain genres certain types of
00:09:23 music in Spain
00:09:26 and of course Rosalía
00:09:30 Rosalía all her life all her life she has
00:09:34 heard flamenco sung with an
00:09:38 Andalusian accent and I think it is normal that
00:09:43 for her the most natural thing for Rosalía
00:09:47 is to sing flamenco just
00:09:50 like her  He has always heard it and
00:09:54 what do you think? Does it seem
00:09:57 strange that the accent changes or does it not
00:10:02 seem normal
00:10:04 to you and you knew Rosalía
00:10:07 before?

00:00:13 hello earlier we have been juggling the
00:00:19 balls and now we are going to
00:00:24 teach tere how to juggle
00:00:28 you are ready ready then you start
00:00:33 with one one one ball
00:00:35 with one so you have one hand two
00:00:41 hands right you have to pass if you have
00:00:45 two three
00:00:50 and you have to pass pass the ball from this
00:00:55 hand from the right hand to the left hand
00:00:58 okay like that okay and then the same but from
00:01:04 the left hand to the right hand okay
00:01:08 and so on a few times
00:01:18 yes a little a little high and the  hand you
00:01:25 don't have to move it to fetch the
00:01:27 ball it has to go and fall into the hand fall
00:01:30 directly into the hand without moving don't
00:01:33 move the hand here
00:01:39 with one ball it's easy ok now
00:01:44 now we're going to do it with 22 balls ok
00:01:48 then what  you have to do it's the
00:01:52 same the same move in the same
00:01:54 move this ball has to go to
00:01:57 this hand here but before this
00:02:00 ball lands you have to throw this ball the
00:02:04 same as before in this move
00:02:07 so it's not it's not like that  it doesn't have to go
00:02:12 up and up both the
00:02:17 same the same movement here
00:02:26 ok ok as a first try it's very
00:02:29 good most people do this
00:02:34 but you've done it very well so up
00:02:36 and up
00:02:41 very good both right now but  at the
00:02:45 same height the two balls are
00:02:48 doing very well yes yes the two balls are the
00:02:50 same at the same height not one high and
00:02:53 one low not easy and first
00:02:59 practice with your right hand and then
00:03:03 your left hand right hand left
00:03:06 right left right left but
00:03:13 then you have to change first
00:03:15 left and then right left
00:03:18 right left right to win it's
00:03:24 different it's different and it's that learning
00:03:26 is to practice both ways first
00:03:29 right and first left
00:03:38 the next thing is 33 balls
00:03:43 then 3 balls but first we're going to
00:03:47 do only three throws  since it's
00:03:51 okay then it will be
00:03:54 like this 1 2 and 3 and you take them you don't have
00:04:01 to continue just 1 2 and 3 and you take it here
00:04:03 1 2 and 3
00:04:05 then you roll in l  by hand you start
00:04:09 the first you have 2 2 balls worth 1 2 and 3
00:04:14 and then at the end one thing is worth okay
00:04:37 and now we can start with the
00:04:41 left hand with two balls in the left hand
00:04:50 first first we started with the
00:04:54 right hand 22 balls out of 12  and then
00:04:59 you have to practice the opposite with the
00:05:02 left hand 12 and start
00:05:08 the hands remember the hands remember to
00:05:13 have them separated
00:05:15 if not like
00:05:18 this
00:05:20 no no no it's not nice
00:05:24 better better separated
00:05:31 ok now again like the right is
00:05:37 forgotten you haven't forgotten very well  okay
00:05:41 next 24 times with the right
00:05:45 start with what you want but take care of it
00:05:47 four times with a two three and one plus
00:05:50 one two three four
00:05:55 and one more it's here
00:06:11 1 2 3
00:06:21 16 minutes to study they are all balls
00:06:29 but you are very good at juggling
00:06:33 ha  It took her before she had never
00:06:38 juggled but she has gone from 0 to 77
00:06:45 throws in 0 7 in 16 minutes
00:06:51 very quickly she learns very quickly yes this is
00:06:54 very good
00:06:59 but but it is very easy you too  Who
00:07:01 can everyone that I have seen
00:07:05 learn to juggle always almost
00:07:10 almost always takes less than an
00:07:15 hour yes yes yes so you at
00:07:18 home
00:07:20 at home can also learn to
00:07:23 juggle you have to watch my video
00:07:28 video on
00:07:31 how to do it  our own waves and
00:07:35 so then to summarize you have
00:07:40 to start with a ball and pass it
00:07:45 from the right hand to the left from the
00:07:47 left to the right like this
00:07:51 and remember that the ball has to go high it
00:07:56 has to go up up
00:07:58 up no not like that  no no up
00:08:04 later with 22 balls you have to do the
00:08:09 same
00:08:11 first one hand and then the other hand
00:08:14 like this
00:08:17 and the second ball has to go up and
00:08:21 up inside here not outside
00:08:25 like this no no not inside like
00:08:33 this and then you have to change
00:08:37 first right left and then
00:08:41 left right left right yes
00:08:45 yes yes it is different it is different so
00:08:51 you both have to practice right
00:08:54 to left and left to right
00:08:57 and then ok  You can do it with 33 balls
00:09:02 1 2 and 3 like this 12 3 123 first with the
00:09:11 right hand
00:09:12 12 31 23
00:09:15 yes yes first with the right hand and
00:09:18 then with the left 123 1 2 3 123 and
00:09:28 remember that the balls always have
00:09:33 to go to the same  the same height
00:09:37 can't be high low high no no it doesn't have
00:09:41 to be here here here here here here yes
00:09:45 yes yes and hands hands don't
00:09:49 put them together if you put them too close it
00:09:52 's hard it's hard to do and it's not it's
00:09:56 not pretty  no no no it's better with your
00:10:00 hands
00:10:01 separated like that
00:10:12 i like it
00:10:17 you're going to continue when you get back to mexico

00:00:05 Thai,
00:00:08 you know, well, yes, and in this video I am going
00:00:14 to explain how I studied or rather
00:00:20 how I did not study Thai and I think
00:00:28 that what will surprise you the most
00:00:32 are the things that I did not do
00:00:36 that  I didn't
00:00:39 [Music]
00:00:45 hello, well, for me, learning Thai
00:00:50 has been an experiment, an experiment,
00:00:57 because I have tried to learn in
00:01:02 a very different way, a very different way,
00:01:06 different from normal,
00:01:09 different from how I
00:01:14 learned languages, learned English in the past.  French and
00:01:21 and I wanted to know if this method, this
00:01:25 different way, is going well or not,
00:01:30 that's why between 2015 and 2016
00:01:40 I came here I came to Bangkok one year one
00:01:46 year
00:01:48 I was in Bangkok and when I was
00:01:54 here when I was in Bangkok I went to
00:01:58 a
00:02:11 I don't like to
00:02:17 do it in a school I don't like to go to
00:02:22 a school to learn languages
00:02:26 so why because it was  i went to a
00:02:31 school to learn thai i went to
00:02:36 a school because this school is very
00:02:40 different it's different from other
00:02:43 schools no i don't like learning in a
00:02:50 school in fact when i learned
00:02:53 english i didn't go to a school when i
00:02:57 learned french i didn't go to a school
00:03:00 when  I learned Japanese I didn't go to a
00:03:04 school so why because this time
00:03:09 I did go to a school well it's
00:03:14 because this school is different it's
00:03:18 different from the other schools
00:03:22 in this school there are no exams no no no
00:03:27 no you like them
00:03:32 I don't like exams I don't like I
00:03:36 don't like exams in this
00:03:40 school you don't have to study you don't have to
00:03:45 study study no no no it's not a
00:03:49 school you go to and you only
00:03:53 listen listen and that's it it's a
00:03:59 school where you  there are two teachers
00:04:04 teacher is a teacher
00:04:08 a teacher
00:04:11 there are two teachers who talk talk to
00:04:14 each other and talk to you and speak
00:04:19 only thai only thai yes if
00:04:24 they don't speak english no no
00:04:28 and you naturally  You naturally begin
00:04:34 to understand Thai and after
00:04:39 listening for many, many hours little by
00:04:43 little
00:04:43 little by little you begin to be able to
00:04:48 speak Thai yes yes and it's very funny I
00:04:54 already laugh I laugh hahahaha I laugh a
00:04:58 lot at school it's because  The
00:05:02 teachers
00:05:04 are funny they are very funny
00:05:08 and then in 2016 then I went back I went back
00:05:16 to Spain I went back I went back to Spain I went back to
00:05:22 Barcelona but but I kept on
00:05:27 learning Thai
00:05:32 every day every day every day every day
00:05:37 I talk for two hours two hours I talk with my
00:05:43 friend my  friend
00:05:47 my friend thai and she she speaks
00:05:52 thai and i speak english so

00:06:00 too i also listen to tv i watch i watch
00:06:06 tv tv tv
00:06:11 thai tv and i listen to podcasts do you
00:06:15 know podcasts i don't think i think so already
00:06:19 bone much has been said before about
00:06:22 podcasts they are  similar to the radio like
00:06:27 the radio of a lifetime classic the
00:06:30 radio that you can listen to the radio but
00:06:34 over the internet over the internet not by
00:06:39 internet that you can listen to them on the
00:06:42 phone on the phone on the mobile
00:06:45 you can listen to the podcasts and now
00:06:53 I've been learning Thai for more or less two years two and a
00:06:58 half years two and a half years
00:07:03 and now I can talk I can have a
00:07:07 conversation
00:07:09 if it's a conversation that  It is not very very
00:07:12 difficult if it is not very difficult I can
00:07:15 talk without much problem and I understand I
00:07:20 understand TV I understand TV more

00:00:05 god
00:00:07 god
00:00:09 hello today I am going to talk about religion of
00:00:14 religion in spain
00:00:17 in spain spain is a country that is
00:00:22 traditionally traditionally
00:00:26 for a long time it is traditionally
00:00:29 catholic catholic
00:00:33 the catholic religion is a type of
00:00:36 christianity  of Christianity it is not the
00:00:41 religion of the father the father of the pope of
00:00:45 Rome in Rome is the father right the father
00:00:49 is the head of the Catholic Church in
00:00:54 Spain before the government no the government
00:01:01 and the church
00:01:05 the government and the church were together
00:01:08 before yes yes  yes and in 1976 the
00:01:18 government was separated and months already then until
00:01:22 1976 there was this man this man the
00:01:27 head the head of the government of spain
00:01:33 and the government was officially catholic it
00:01:37 was from the catholic church yes yes but in
00:01:42 1976 they separated and the government  it went on to
00:01:47 have no religion no
00:01:49 official religion and since then from this year
00:01:53 until now there are fewer and fewer
00:01:57 people less people people believe less and
00:02:03 less in god god  yes yes and right
00:02:09 now 20 20 percent of
00:02:14 Spaniards do not believe there is any god
00:02:18 no god no no no
00:02:20 but especially young people
00:02:25 people under 40 40 I don't know there are more
00:02:32 people there are more people who don't believe  They do not believe
00:02:36 in God, for example, people, people
00:02:41 under 24 years of age, there are 50 percent,
00:02:47 50 percent who say they
00:02:51 have no religion, they are not Catholics, they
00:02:55 are not Muslims, they do not belong to any
00:02:58 religion, no, no, and 70 percent.
00:03:02 Seventy percent of the people in Spain
00:03:06 never never go no they don't go to church no
00:03:13 no no no they don't go to church for example
00:03:16 me since I was little

00:03:23 for baptisms baptisms weddings
00:03:30 weddings and funerals when there are  a funeral
00:03:34 that someone dies also these three
00:03:37 these three occasions I have gone to
00:03:39 church but that's all and it's
00:03:43 not me Pablo or blog
00:03:48 I have a father
00:03:51 and a mother and my parents my parents
00:03:56 have never spoken to me about God no  They have talked to me about
00:04:00 religion no no no and  Right now I do
00:04:06 n't believe I don't believe there is a god I don't believe
00:04:10 that after death after

00:01:50 with rice
00:01:52 and with balloons with balloons yes yes yes let's
00:01:57 start if then we are going to
00:02:03 open the rice with rice the rice
00:02:08 is already open
00:02:13 then what color do you want what golden color
00:02:19 okay then we are going to start the layers
00:02:22 two layers from inside so for example
00:02:24 the  red we cut it we cut the balloon and
00:02:30 we put rice inside
00:02:37 and
00:02:42 now instead of plans we are going to make a
00:02:46 funnel
00:02:49 funnel we are going to inflate take balloons
00:03:05 and here we put it around
00:03:18 no
00:03:34 good that was all
00:03:57 [Music]
00:03:59 so now if it opens it is
00:04:24 worth a blast
00:04:28 and  It's soft,
00:04:32 it's deformed, it's deformed
00:04:45 around here,
00:04:47 here it's done,
00:04:56 oh,
00:04:59 well, three balls, dynamite,
00:05:05 very well,
00:05:09 I can't,
00:05:13 very well, let's review what we have
00:05:17 done, we have taken balloons, balloons, we
00:05:23 have not taken a balloon, a bottle, we have
00:05:27 cut the bottle, we have put the balloon.
00:05:31 in the mouth in the mouth of the bottle
00:05:34 then we have liquid rice then we have
00:05:38 thrown love everywhere
00:05:45 then we have put rice inside the
00:05:48 balloon and the balloon with the rice inside  or
00:05:53 we have cut the mouth of the balloon
00:05:57 and then we have cut more more balloons
00:06:01 a little bit down here yes yes and
00:06:09 then between 22 people one person
00:06:12 holds
00:06:16 the balloon and the other person puts the
00:06:21 ball
00:06:26 inside the balloon  and we haven't done it four
00:06:30 times you can't do it four or more
00:06:33 times
00:06:34 if you do it more times it's more resistant
00:06:37 and the ball won't break yes yes and be
00:06:42 careful that all the
00:06:45 balls are the same we don't want to make one
00:06:48 very big and one  very small no no
00:06:51 because but when
00:06:54 juggling one ball is heavy and the other ball is
00:06:59 not heavy and it is difficult it is difficult to
00:07:02 juggle yes yes and think also think
00:07:08 about the colors think about the colors
00:07:11 because the last two balloons the balloons
00:07:16 will be seen by  example this is gold
00:07:20 not gold
00:07:23 white white yes yes yes
00:07:26 and look look look terre even drawn little
00:07:30 faces face look into the eyes the mouth not
00:07:34 the eyes the mouth yes yes yes this one this one
00:07:38 is boring

00:01:52 okay but it only had one thing 1 point
00:01:55 that was more interesting
00:01:58 one thing that was interesting what a thing
00:02:02 andrés live
00:02:04 look for example
00:02:06 you  Pablo I you live on a fourth floor

00:02:17 let you see here here is Pablo be
00:02:20 in a barbarian to that house my house where
00:02:25 I grew up I know how many floors when the floors

00:02:31 33 more floors more than 3 more than 3 feet
00:02:35 at 4 more than 4 more than 4 up to 45 it
00:02:40 's a house they were very small floors
00:02:44 but they already had seven floors it's worth
00:02:47 exactly per day seven floors it's
00:02:50 a bit strange house 1 2 3  4 5 6 17 even
00:02:55 not suitable for 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7
00:02:58 exactly oysters it was a little weird it was
00:03:00 a house it was one sided on floor or
00:03:02 floor floor nothing 91 here there were stairs
00:03:06 stairs every time every time there are in
00:03:08 some ten steps  one step two
00:03:12 steps three steps almost  ten on
00:03:14 each floor for a few days and elevator
00:03:18 what there is no elevator no ping elevator
00:03:21 there was no voltage or unfortunately unfortunately
00:03:25 bad luck you had no
00:03:27 motor from 1 from 1 to 7
00:03:30 but in little ones that is maybe there is
00:03:32 a room here or  two there a
00:03:34 room or two in each two
00:03:35 rooms
00:03:36 two rooms divided in two like this
00:03:40 two rooms a little weird house
00:03:44 that's why look at me when I was little when I
00:03:47 was little 15 am it was very bad well
00:03:51 I'm still very bad at all
00:03:54 sports because the  sports football or

00:07:30 are also attractions as in many many
00:07:34 fairs in spain there are attractions but the one
00:07:38 at the fair in april is the
00:07:41 largest park in spain the fair park the
00:07:44 largest temporary park in
00:07:47 spain
00:07:48 the fair began in 1846  and at the
00:07:56 beginning when they started they were
00:07:59 farmers they were farmers they were
00:08:03 ranchers they
00:08:04 were farmers they were ranchers but already
00:08:09 in 1850 they began to see
00:08:17 stores with food and drink
00:08:21 and in 1859 there was already more
00:08:30 space more space more space for parties
00:08:34 than for the market the market  It is the
00:08:38 least important thing and in 1973 this area began to be
00:08:46 used the area the current area
00:08:50 before the fair was held in an enclosure in
00:08:55 a smaller area and it was moved it was moved
00:09:00 to the current site which is larger there is
00:09:03 more space in 1973 no and  On the map
00:09:08 you can see that there is the area of ​​the
00:09:10 booths and there is the area of ​​the attractions of the
00:09:14 amusement park

",2
327,"00:00:00 the number
00:00:02 is equal to 2.7 18 good about 27 18
00:00:14 because well today in this video I'm going
00:00:20 to explain it to you very easy very very easy
00:00:27 [Music]
00:00:30 hello well yes this is a
00:00:35 mathematics video of mathematics yes and I think I
00:00:43 think we  all of us all
00:00:46 study we study number at
00:00:51 school at school we study it no
00:00:54 but many times the
00:01:00 teachers don't explain it very well
00:01:03 so today I'm going to teach you how to think
00:01:09 about number and in a very
00:01:12 intuitive way first why  because the number is very
00:01:19 important and the
00:01:23 number explains, for example, the cells
00:01:28 the multiplication of the cells in
00:01:32 our body our body is made
00:01:35 up of cells cells many very
00:01:39 small cells and these
00:01:43 cells multiply they
00:01:46 multiply not where there is a cell
00:01:49 then  there are 2
00:01:52 two cells not from one to two from two
00:01:59 to four to four and thus they
00:02:03 multiply they do not always multiply
00:02:07 because by two times two times
00:02:11 two they multiply by two and it is  This is
00:02:16 very similar to how banks work,
00:02:20 banks give interest, they give a
00:02:26 percentage of interest, a percentage they give
00:02:30 or charge, they charge you interest, for example,
00:02:33 the bank looks at me, this is me, this is me,
00:02:39 I don't have I don't have hair, Pablo, not him.
00:02:44 bank gave me money
00:02:48 gave me money money to buy a
00:02:52 flat to pay for my flat
00:02:55 I have a flat this is my flat
00:02:59 to pay for the flat the bank gave me
00:03:03 money but every month every month January or
00:03:07 February or March or April every month I
00:03:10 I have to pay pay the bank I have to
00:03:15 pay interest I have to pay a
00:03:18 percentage a percentage not this
00:03:21 percentage
00:03:22 well more or less is 3 a 33
00:03:26 percent the same when we put
00:03:29 money in the bank we put money or
00:03:32 invest we invest money in something the
00:03:36 bank doesn't  We put money and the
00:03:39 bank gives us interest, it gives us interest,
00:03:42 what interest does the bank give us? Well, for
00:03:47 example, this may not be 3%, what
00:03:51 happens if we put 100 in the bank and it gives us
00:03:54 3% of 100, it becomes  103
00:04:00 but this is not true because the
00:04:04 bank is waiting for us
00:04:06 the bank is not waiting for us for a year
00:04:09 a whole year for example all of
00:04:13 2020 the bank is waiting for us waiting for us
00:04:18 all year to calculate the interest the
00:04:22 bank is adding it adding it  it is
00:04:25 putting more then for example this
00:04:29 is an example if the interest were
00:04:34 one hundred percent when the interest is one
00:04:37 hundred percent one hundred percent
00:04:41 means that in one year
00:04:42 you will have two hundred you will not have two hundred
00:04:46 this is one hundred percent interest is
00:04:49 the same as the cells it multiplies it
00:04:53 multiplies by two here the same
00:04:56 multiplies by two
00:04:57 the cells the same by two by two by
00:05:00 two this is one hundred percent interest
00:05:04 what happens that the bank is not waiting the
00:05:07 bank is waiting for us for a whole year
00:05:10 the cells the  cells are not
00:05:14 expected either maybe this cell this cell
00:05:18 now does not multiply no it does not
00:05:21 multiply by two
00:05:22 no but this is so it is so it
00:05:26 multiplies then yes the bank if the
00:05:31 bank always always goes calcu  Lando is
00:05:35 calculating the interest after one year
00:05:38 at the end of 2020 for example you do not
00:05:42 end with 200 you do not end with 210 at 71.8
00:05:55 271.8 if if this is this 27 18 if
00:06:02 you start with 1
00:06:04 you end with 2,718 because for example this
00:06:14 it is 2020
00:06:17 this is 2021 no so here are 1 1 2
00:06:25 3
00:06:26 no yes you if you have 11 in the bank and
00:06:32 the bank does not the bank is expected is
00:06:36 expected then at the end at the end of
00:06:39 2020 in 2021 the bank gives us 1 no  it gives
00:06:45 us 1 it gives us one hundred percent we have
00:06:49 interest
00:06:51 this blue is interest
00:06:55 what happens in 2022 the bank does not give us one it
00:07:01 does not give us two because because it gives us
00:07:06 one hundred percent one hundred percent of
00:07:09 our capital our money plus
00:07:13 interest  plus the interest
00:07:16 then in 2022 we have the
00:07:21 original money the original money plus the
00:07:25 interest the interest of 2021 plus the
00:07:31 interest of 2022
00:07:37 the interest percentage also also
00:07:41 counts the interest the previous interest
00:07:45 what happens if we count if we
00:07:48 count the interest every day every  day
00:07:51 every day of the year goes  Let's start here and there
00:07:55 will be interest and then this one
00:07:59 hundred percent will not only be about one
00:08:03 it will not be about one it will be about 1.0
00:08:09 I don't know 0 4 for example and
00:08:14 then it will multiply and it will  it will grow it
00:08:17 will grow it will not grow like this it will not
00:08:22 grow like this
00:08:25 but it will grow more faster if
00:08:29 here we have interest and then
00:08:33 very quickly we have interest on the
00:08:38 interest
00:08:40 and interest on the interest of the interest
00:08:45 then at the end at the end at  end of the
00:08:49 year at the end of 2020 we will not have 2
00:08:53 we will have 2,718 we will have almost three
00:09:00 we will be here already we will be here no
00:09:05 and then at the end of 2021 well
00:09:09 even more even more then the
00:09:12 number is not an invented number it is not
00:09:16 a number that someone who  a person
00:09:18 has thought ok and it will be 2.7 18 it
00:09:26 is not a natural number it
00:09:28 is a number that we find we find
00:09:31 in nature we find in the
00:09:34 speed the speed as the cells
00:09:37 the cells multiply as the
00:09:41 interest the interest of the  banks are
00:09:44 growing and the reason why
00:09:48 we
00:09:50 do x x or rather t not t is the time
00:09:56 that is the time so for example if
00:10:01 the bank the bank gives us 3 percent
00:10:04 3 percent is 0.03 we can do it
00:10:10 multiply multiply put because it is
00:10:13 less than 100 not 3% is less
00:10:17 than 100% then by the raised to the
00:10:21 amount the amount of time the
00:10:24 number of years for example if there are three
00:10:28 years 2020 of 21 and 22 then it is by the
00:10:32 raised to  3 and so we can know how much
00:10:38 money how much money we will have at the end
00:10:41 of three out of three years with this with this
00:10:45 calculation with this mathematical calculation and
00:10:48 well I hope that now you understand
00:10:51 why we use the number and
00:10:55 the number is where the number comes from
00:10:58 and  that you have clarified a
00:11:01 question from a long time ago and if you like it if
00:11:08 you like dream in spanish you like

329,"00:00:00 Today
00:00:03 today I am going to explain to you why co2
00:00:11 co2 allows the sun to
00:00:17 heat the earth but does not allow
00:00:22 the heat to escape and why it
00:00:27 makes the earth get hotter and
00:00:31 hotter and more and more
00:00:36 hotter
00:00:40 [Music]
00:00:43 hello
00:00:45 sure you've heard you've
00:00:48 heard of the greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect
00:00:53 as a greenhouse no
00:00:57 that makes the earth get
00:01:00 hotter and hotter that
00:01:05 the temperature rises and it's called the
00:01:09 greenhouse effect because of the  greenhouses where
00:01:14 there are plants do not grow plants but
00:01:17 in truth the effect is different the
00:01:21 name is it is a bad name
00:01:25 a greenhouse a greenhouse is different from what
00:01:29 happens on earth but the
00:01:33 greenhouse effect produces climate change
00:01:36 climate change or global
00:01:40 warming does  that it warms up that the
00:01:44 temperature of the earth rises and the
00:01:47 scientists
00:01:49 the scientists agree they
00:01:52 have agreed that the reason for
00:01:56 global warming  It is the greenhouse effect it
00:01:59 is the effect of
00:02:04 carbon dioxide and other gases
00:02:07 so I studied the
00:02:12 greenhouse effect at school when
00:02:15 I went to school and they told me yes
00:02:19 yes the gases co2 and other gases do not
00:02:24 allow radiation  Let the
00:02:27 radiation escape from the earth, they do not
00:02:30 allow it, not here it was because the co2 the
00:02:35 co2 that stops them but I did not
00:02:39 understand why because the co2 for these
00:02:43 rays but not for these rays the rays
00:02:48 that come the rays of light  the radiation
00:02:52 that enters the earth that enters
00:02:56 the atmosphere not the co2
00:02:59 the co2 would have to make the
00:03:03 earth cool down to lower the
00:03:07 temperature no well today I am going to
00:03:10 explain why why the co2
00:03:15 heats the earth and this reason  it is that
00:03:20 this radiation and this radiation are
00:03:25 different they are different types of
00:03:29 radiation
00:03:30 so the sun heats heats the
00:03:34 earth heats it with light of many
00:03:38 colors of all colors light red
00:03:43 green blue all all colors no
00:03:47 light ultraviolet light also so
00:03:52 light light has different frequencies it
00:03:56 has low
00:04:00 frequencies and high frequencies this is
00:04:04 frequency high frequency it's many hertz i'm going to
00:04:09 talk about wavelength of length
00:04:12 here the wavelength is low here the
00:04:18 frequency is low but the length  The
00:04:22 wavelength is high, the wavelength is high
00:04:26 , not if we draw the light
00:04:30 by wavelength, we have the
00:04:34 ultraviolet,
00:04:36 then the blue light, the green light, the
00:04:40 red light and the infrared, the infrared
00:04:45 that we do not see, and this is
00:04:49 not a wavelength.  I know in meters for
00:04:52 example
00:04:55 then the sun the sun does not send
00:04:59 energy it sends us light in all
00:05:03 colors the colors that we see and
00:05:07 those that we do not see ultraviolet
00:05:10 infrared sends us of all types
00:05:13 not most most of
00:05:17 energy  energy that heats the earth is
00:05:21 visible light is the light that we see that
00:05:24 we see ultraviolet
00:05:27 ultraviolet does not reach us much because
00:05:31 we have the layer of o  zone we don't have
00:05:34 ozone o3 that protects us protects us
00:05:39 from ultraviolet rays so this light
00:05:42 reaches the earth and the earth
00:05:45 heats up the air
00:05:49 heats up and the surface of the earth
00:05:51 heats up the ground heats up the sea
00:05:56 heats up bruce's head  willis
00:06:00 and what happens that all the things all the
00:06:04 hot things all the things
00:06:08 that are not that are not at zero zero degrees
00:06:12 kelvin emit radiation I, for example,
00:06:17 am at I don't know 36 and a half and it emits
00:06:23 radiation all the things that are not at
00:06:27 zero  absolute zero degrees emit
00:06:30 infrared emit infrared so
00:06:34 the earth when it heats up receives
00:06:39 light visible light and then emits infrared
00:06:43 emits another frequency emits a
00:06:47 lower frequency not a
00:06:50 higher wavelength and what happens than
00:06:54 carbon dioxide and other gases other gases
00:06:58 greenhouse effect methane for example
00:07:01 methane water water vapor they are
00:07:05 invisible they
00:07:06 are transparent they are transparent
00:07:10 because we do not see them they are
00:07:13 transparent  tes in blue green red but they
00:07:17 are not transparent in infrared they are not
00:07:22 transparent at all at all the
00:07:25 infrared then the earth by the
00:07:29 temperature by the temperature at which
00:07:32 it emits infrared more or less
00:07:37 near 10 10 micrometers
00:07:41 around 10 micrometers  emits infrared
00:07:46 its infrared
00:07:48 and this depends on the temperature
00:07:51 very hot things like hot metal
00:07:54 hot glass that is
00:07:57 red hot emit visible light light that
00:08:01 we see the earth is not so
00:08:05 hot
00:08:05 that's why it emits in infrared so
00:08:10 what's up look look  this image the
00:08:14 yellow part of the yellow color is
00:08:18 what the surface of the earth
00:08:21 emits but the red part the red part
00:08:26 in the middle is the part that
00:08:31 actually reaches space that is thrown
00:08:34 out into space all the
00:08:37 yellow part everything  what is yellow in color is
00:08:40 absorbed by methane, carbon
00:08:44 dioxide, water vapor, it is absorbed and
00:08:48 the atmosphere is kept warm by
00:08:52 the super  surface the air stays
00:08:54 hot it gets hotter because all the
00:08:58 yellow part is absorbed the
00:09:03 heat stays on the earth so the more
00:09:06 carbon dioxide we have the more
00:09:11 the surface of the earth heats up
00:09:14 methane also affects
00:09:17 dogs and dogs for example  of cows and
00:09:21 such also affect what happens that
00:09:25 methane does not last long in the
00:09:27 atmosphere it reaches the atmosphere it is
00:09:30 in the atmosphere for a few weeks and then it is
00:09:33 destroyed water vapor ceases to exist
00:09:37 water vapor is quite
00:09:40 automatic it depends  of the temperature if
00:09:44 the temperature rises then the
00:09:47 water vapor the amount of vapor clouds in the
00:09:51 sky rises if the temperature drops the
00:09:54 water vapor also drops
00:09:56 then of the water vapor we
00:10:02 can't do much with the water vapor
00:10:04 but we do  we can do with
00:10:08 carbon dioxide and with methane methane
00:10:11 is also important
00:10:13 so well this is the reason why
00:10:17 the earth heats up if there are more
00:10:21 gases  of greenhouse effects
00:10:24 that the light the radiation that enters the
00:10:28 earth is different from the one that comes out
00:10:31 that carbon dioxide is transparent it is
00:10:36 invisible it is not seen in the colors of the
00:10:41 light that enters but it can be seen it is black
00:10:44 that it is  colored black for
00:10:48 certain frequencies of infrared
00:10:51 certain colors of infrared light
00:10:55 this is why we have to
00:10:59 stop we have to stop burning we have to
00:11:03 stop burning coal burning
00:11:07 oil if we don't want
00:11:11 the earth's temperature  keep growing
00:11:14 and growing and growing so if
00:11:18 you have understood something you have learned
00:11:21 something that you didn't know before leave me a
00:11:24 comment tell me below in the
00:11:27 comments and if you like it if you like
00:11:32 dreaming spanish but you don't know which
00:11:35 videos which videos to watch first which
00:11:40 videos to watch later how to continue
00:11:42 improving I recommend the one
00:11:47 dollar course for only one dollar you will receive
00:11:52 a course a course of an hour
00:11:55 an hour and a half
00:11:58 an hour and a half
00:12:00 and you will learn how  or improve with
00:12:04 dreaming spanish and how to keep
00:12:07 improving yourselves
00:12:10 ok I leave you the link I leave you the link
00:12:14 below in the video description
00:12:17 ok come on goodbye

00:01:17 who is the daughter the daughter of Rocío not that
00:01:21 Estefanía Estefanía called the doctor to the
00:01:25 doctor and just at that moment
00:01:31 Estefanía arrives Estefanía comes Estefanía
00:01:35 saw them from above she saw them from
00:01:40 the balcony from the balcony of her house she
00:01:43 saw them and  Mikael says come on let's go to the
00:01:48 hospital we go to the hospital but
00:01:52 Estefanía says no no no we don't go
00:01:55 up we go upstairs we go up to her
00:01:59 apartment to her floor and I'll
00:02:03 call the doctor then Rocío
00:02:07 Estefanía
00:02:08 and Mika  They go up they go up to the floor they don't go up
00:02:13 to Estefanía's and Rocío's apartment Rocío is
00:02:18 asking questions but Micael
00:02:22 Mikael what are you doing because because you see yourself
00:02:27 with another woman you kiss Paula but
00:02:31 you are going to marry you are going to marry
00:02:34 Estefanía and Mikael  she is going to say oh
00:02:38 and Estefanía
00:02:40 Estefanía tells her to shut up and not to
00:02:44 talk
00:02:45 and on the floor in Estefanía's flat
00:02:49 Estefanía tells Mikael that she
00:02:52 has already called the doctor and
00:02:56 Mikael asks Mikael
00:02:59 if he wants help  If she needs
00:03:03 some help and Estefanía tells her, Mikael,
00:03:08 you've already helped enough.
00:03:32 looking and
00:03:37 Estefanía says I thought you were a
00:03:43 better person I thought you weren't going to
00:03:47 be a bad person to be a bad person with my mom
00:03:50 with Rocío go get out of my apartment go and
00:03:55 mikael well he's leaving no and
00:04:01 noelia's apartment is paula and  Mikael is there and
00:04:08 they both feel bad, no, but Micael
00:04:14 Mikael tells him that it's over with Estefanía,
00:04:19 it's over, and Mikael
00:04:22 says I shouldn't
00:04:26 have lied, never lied to Rocío and
00:04:31 I don't like Estefanía  he says Estefanía
00:04:34 Estefanía also shouldn't have
00:04:38 lied to have lied to her mother
00:04:40 for Paula Paula says well well it doesn't help us it
00:04:46 doesn't help thinking about
00:04:50 the past no
00:04:51 rocio well rocio is still fine at
00:04:55 least she hasn't had a heart attack  No, he
00:04:59 hasn't died, no, and Paula says no, no, Mikael,
00:05:04 no, that's it,
00:05:08 I don't want Rocío to die,
00:05:14 so you and I, the two of us, it's
00:05:17 better that nothing happens between
00:05:20 us and Estefanía Estefanía on the
00:05:24 balcony, hear them, hear them  and he sees how mikael
00:05:29 mikael leaves and estefanía is
00:05:33 happy well well I've won the winner
00:05:36 yes later later
00:05:39 estefanía calls call micael
00:05:44 but mikael no no he doesn't answer he doesn't pick up the
00:05:49 phone he sees that estefanía is
00:05:52 calling him ring ring per  or not to pick up the
00:05:56 phone later at the orphanage the
00:06:01 orphanage the house where there are children there are no
00:06:07 children children who do not have a father and mother do not
00:06:13 have orphan children no orphan children live in this house
00:06:17 and today there is going to
00:06:21 be a theater they are going to see a play  theater they
00:06:24 are putting on lights lights are
00:06:29 preparing preparing everything for the
00:06:32 play
00:06:34 noelia noelia is helping with the
00:06:38 costumes with the clothes the
00:06:42 actors' clothes and she comes
00:06:44 but hope and the woman and theo tv to
00:06:50 noelia but not he no longer sees he does not see  to AT&amp;T
00:06:55 or Teo leaves Esperanza and the
00:06:59 wife stay because Esperanza wants to see the
00:07:03 play the play no
00:07:05 Esperanza I heard you Noelia you or he goes to
00:07:09 work he goes to the office and
00:07:13 Fernando is also there Fernando is
00:07:16 worried he is worried because  the
00:07:20 actress the actress of the play does
00:07:24 n't come she doesn't come no the actress has called
00:07:27 has called to say that it's going to take it's going
00:07:31 to take longer for them to wait wait
00:07:33 a bit then noelia noelia picks up
00:07:37 the microphone and says  ce
00:07:41 audience spectators gentlemen
00:07:45 spectators we are going to take a
00:07:48 little bit of time we are running late
00:07:50 meanwhile the children can go
00:07:55 eat sweets we have a bar a
00:07:59 sweets bar of sweets to
00:08:02 eat for the children to eat and at the
00:08:05 bar are Noelia and  While
00:08:09 Esperanza looks at the candies and takes them with
00:08:13 the candies, she talks to Noelia. Esperanza
00:08:17 says that it is the first
00:08:21 time in her life that there is going to be a
00:08:25 play and Noelia takes her hand
00:08:30 and takes her to see the actor.  to the
00:08:33 main actor fernando not fernando
00:08:38 fernando is dressed as a
00:08:41 beggar and hope hope is
00:08:45 fascinated and how interesting not to see
00:08:49 behind the scenes of a play
00:08:55 and then the woman comes the woman comes
00:08:58 the woman who has come with hope and
00:09:02 then not him anymore  He sees her and realizes and
00:09:06 then he already knows who Esperanza is, no, and
00:09:11 Nobel, he already tells her Esperanza, you've already
00:09:14 come, your mom has come,
00:09:17 and Esperanza tells her no, no, no, it's not.  It's
00:09:20 not my mom, it's my aunt, and the woman says
00:09:24 yes, that she's Teo's sister.
00:09:40 or not and they
00:09:43 had their daughter they had a daughter
00:09:46 esperanza but teo's wife died
00:09:50 and the woman who takes care of hope
00:09:55 is her sister is teo's sister is not
00:09:59 his wife is not his partner and the woman
00:10:04 teo's sister  He tells Noelia that
00:10:08 when Esperanza was born when she was born her
00:10:12 mother died
00:10:14 and then no he is already surprised yes
00:10:19 yes yes no he had not imagined it
00:10:24 he would never have imagined it then
00:10:29 hope and the woman
00:10:35 return to their seats and sit down again the play
00:10:38 goes  to begin
00:10:41 and to say goodbye, Esperanza
00:10:45 kisses Noelia and kisses her on the
00:10:48 cheek and Noelia is happy no
00:10:52 then the curtain opens the curtain opens
00:10:56 and Fernando Fernando appears
00:11:00 dressed as a beggar
00:11:03 and a woman a woman dressed as a queen
00:11:08 not queen and noelia  Noelia at the same time
00:11:14 and recognizes her it's Rocío it
00:11:19 's Rocío it's Estefanía's mother because
00:11:24 how it is that she's an actress who is
00:11:27 acting in this play
00:11:30 so in the magazine in the magazine office it
00:11:34 's groping and paula and teo teo
00:11:41 asks her why  why did he
00:11:44 call him no and paula tells him you or you
00:11:49 a while ago you told me that I
00:11:53 could go abroad
00:11:56 I could go to another to other countries to
00:12:02 other countries to work
00:12:04 I want to leave I want to leave this
00:12:07 country  After the play they are in the
00:12:13 car in the car are Noelia and
00:12:17 Fernando and Noelia Noelia asks
00:12:20 then Rocío Rocío is not not
00:12:25 sick and Fernando says no no no no
00:12:30 Rocío is very healthy very healthy Rocío is an
00:12:35 actress and Rocío has no children no  she has
00:12:40 sons she has no daughters she is not
00:12:44 Estefanía's mother at teo's house this hope
00:12:50 and hope does not stop talking about noelia she
00:12:56 is talking talking talking talking
00:12:59 about noelia talking a lot about noelia
00:13:02 then teo's sister
00:13:06 realizes that esperanza likes her
00:13:09 he likes noelia and teo's sister
00:13:13 tells him you or now that you don't he already knows that you
00:13:18 are a widower that your wife died maybe
00:13:23 now you can start a family
00:13:27 you can't and theo says I think it
00:13:33 's that noelia doesn't like them  children
00:13:38 don't like children she doesn't like
00:13:42 men who already have children who already
00:13:44 have children no
00:13:46 and noelia and fernando arrive at
00:13:51 noelia's flat
00:13:52 and noelia is going to call paula she is
00:13:58 calling paula but but paula doesn't pick up the
00:14:03 phone the phone  he doesn't pick it up and
00:14:08 fernando on a little table on a little table sees
00:14:13 a note from a note that paula has written
00:14:17 saying saying goodbye
00:14:21 saying goodbye I'm leaving
00:14:24 and noelia says no no why not this this
00:14:30 is nonsense this is nonsense no and
00:14:36 paula's phone number  paula's phone
00:14:39 rings ring ring ring ring but it's in
00:14:44 her pocket in paula's pocket
00:14:47 paula is in a taxi in a taxi going
00:14:53 to the airport and this is the end the
00:14:59 end of the ninth of the ninth episode
00:15:03 look look the last one the last episode
00:15:07 goes  a  Arriving in a short
00:15:10 time is worth it if you want to keep
00:15:14 improving keep improving
00:15:18 your level of Spanish I recommend
00:15:21 the poster the poster
00:15:25 and learn languages ​​on the poster you can
00:15:28 see what level
00:15:31 you are in which of the seven levels 1 2
00:15:36 3 4 5  6 7 you
00:15:40 can't see what to do what things to do
00:15:44 to improve and and well and it's very very
00:15:49 nice to receive it to receive the
00:15:53 pdf it
00:15:55 's free it's free zero euros and
00:15:59 you just have to give us our
00:16:03 email our email you have to sign
00:16:08 up for the mailing list  by
00:16:11 dreaming spanish ok
00:16:14 come on goodbye

342,"00:00:00 Hello today I am going to play a game and I
00:00:07 had played this game before but
00:00:12 only for paid subscribers
00:00:16 for people who pay
00:00:20 20 20 dollars each month
00:00:24 and well today I am going to play well for
00:00:27 everyone I am going to continue  with the departure of
00:00:31 this game this game called
00:00:34 scribblenauts and well it's a very
00:00:39 fun game you have to find go
00:00:42 find missions missions to do
00:00:45 no
00:00:49 [Music]
00:00:53 well that site was a little weird it was a
00:00:57 little different usually there are missions
00:01:03 you have to do things  no people ask you for
00:01:06 things
00:01:09 help me check the alarms we
00:01:13 have to check the alarms to see
00:01:17 if the alarm works we have to make a
00:01:21 fire we
00:01:22 have to make a fire no how can we
00:01:25 make a fire
00:01:27 with the blog here we can write whatever
00:01:33 to see if they have one  bonfire if I can
00:01:36 put a bonfire I put it here
00:01:40 I don't know
00:01:44 very well the alarm works very well
00:01:47 then you can throw things in the
00:01:50 trash but you can write write
00:01:54 whatever for example a dino
00:01:58 Saurio and here you already have a dinosaur you can
00:02:02 ride on the dinosaur
00:02:05 but you have to help go
00:02:08 helping people I have to restart the
00:02:11 heart of the doll
00:02:13 okay wait
00:02:16 until you disassemble

",2
177,"00:00:00 I've moved from one apartment to another to another
00:00:03 apartment
00:00:05 [Music]
00:00:11 hello hello today I'm going to ask you
00:00:16 a question shoot you have seen
00:00:23 have you noticed something different something different
00:00:29 today from the other times we recorded
00:00:34 videos you cut your hair last  hair
00:00:38 hair I would say ha
00:00:40 I think it's not my hair I
00:00:43 think it's grown a bit and my hair has grown too
00:00:46 I think I know what you're talking about if he's
00:00:50 talking about the flat he's changed of
00:00:52 course the flat where I live has changed I
00:00:55 live in a flat  Not in a flat and I've
00:01:00 moved I've changed flats I've moved
00:01:03 from one flat
00:01:04 to another to another exact flat before Pablo
00:01:09 lived in a flat for himself I wasn't alone I was
00:01:14 n't just single I didn't have
00:01:17 roommates no no but he brought a lot of people
00:01:20 girls being still brought borders and
00:01:22 girls
00:01:24 for now and now and now not because
00:01:29 because you've changed because in fact the
00:01:32 two floors are very close they are close and
00:01:35 if it's not too far it's the same area if
00:01:37 it wasn't around the area I
00:01:39 live in Barcelona yes  I live in
00:01:42 Barcelona, ​​not before I lived for e  It's in
00:01:47 this area and now I live in this area.
00:01:52 Yes, it's very close, very close to us.
00:01:54 Far away, it's similar. Yes, and why have you
00:01:57 moved? Then, then, the reason for changing my
00:01:59 apartment is that it costs me
00:02:04 less money here.
00:02:06 Intelligently, it's because of the money for the
00:02:10 Euros
00:02:12 here it costs me less because I'm not there
00:02:17 I'm just sharing we are 44
00:02:21 people we are 4 another person

00:03:35 a bit

00:03:48 or do the boys work here the
00:03:50 french boy is studying ok he is

00:04:02 february in february he is going he is going and he is going to
00:04:06 change he is going  a different person is coming in
00:04:10 and the two Italian guys are
00:04:14 working they work if they work in a
00:04:18 restaurant in a pizzeria making
00:04:24 pizza do you like do you like pizza
00:04:29 at the state level it is for me this is very
00:04:31 interesting and I like it is important that it
00:04:34 is interesting that  Your
00:04:36 flatmates have been cooks for years and have cooked well
00:04:39 but if you want next
00:04:42 time we can go eat pizza to eat
00:04:45 pizza at a pizzeria
00:04:51 so I'm going to ask you well I've seen
00:04:53 that  You have placed the decoration from before
00:04:59 it has been extracted here safely decorates a
00:05:03 flat quite a lot Pablo the decoration I
00:05:06 like al if you like it exactly I have I have
00:05:10 posters I have some posters that I put
00:05:13 on the wall from here no you don't see them
00:05:16 but they are there in the  wall
00:05:19 my favorite poster my favorite poster is what
00:05:22 it's called it's a calendar it's a
00:05:25 calendar but it's not a
00:05:28 normal calendar like this no no he calls it it's a
00:05:31 calendar of the life of my life of all
00:05:33 my
00:05:35 life section 1 like this until  I die
00:05:38 every time a week goes by seven days
00:05:42 each time you do it for a week
00:05:45 Pablo puts a cross if it's a cross there
00:05:49 are all little squares and there are
00:05:53 little squares like this and each
00:05:56 square is a week
00:06:00 and each row
00:06:04 in each row
00:06:05 is  a
00:06:08 year is where you will understand all the poster
00:06:12 are that they are 90 90 years that more or less
00:06:18 is the whole life of an interesting person
00:06:23 but this this this scares
00:06:29 you because you can see when you can see that
00:06:34 your life is not infinite  There is a moment
00:06:37 when it ends if it makes you think a little
00:06:40 it is not very interesting when my
00:06:44 friends when they see the poster there are 22
00:06:49 react there are people who think that
00:06:53 there is fear or not I do not want it
00:06:55 and there are people who see it and  think
00:07:01 it helps you kill live in the moment
00:07:05 think about my life doesn't last forever
00:07:08 today i have to have fun i have to
00:07:12 work hard i have to do things i
00:07:14 really want i want to do very well
00:07:17 i like angeli it's the
00:07:21 repair part that i really like  he likes it better but what
00:07:23 caught my attention when I
00:07:26 entered today was not this no
00:07:28 what caught his attention he was
00:07:31 surprised actually to see it no they are not
00:07:34 Pablo's underpants
00:07:37 [Laughter]
00:07:40 my underpants have a lot of
00:07:44 underpants
00:07:50 I don't have batteries batteries for clothes it
00:07:55 still doesn't have a place to put the
00:07:57 clothes not all the dirty clothes that you take off
00:08:01 and throw away we put them in a pile which
00:08:05 is normally good a container a
00:08:09 place with a lid not
00:08:12 to throw away the clothes all the  clothes but I don't
00:08:17 have batteries it doesn't have a basket for the
00:08:20 laundry I would give in my previous apartment there was
00:08:22 one there was a basket a battery to put
00:08:25 the clothes but it's not mine here in
00:08:28 the apartment and now I don't have I have to go to
00:08:31 a store to buy  to buy a battery he
00:08:34 is a director that's why my laundry is
00:08:38 here yes i know adriano a
00:08:45 different question this is thinking
00:08:47 do you like living with roommates better
00:08:50 than living alone because i think i
00:08:52 prefer with roommates the seconds of
00:08:54 you with roommates and  With more than living
00:08:56 with people I do get along well if they are
00:09:01 good people we are friends
00:09:03 yes but I want to live with friends because
00:09:05 if I am alone I feel a little
00:09:09 just a little I want friends I want to talk
00:09:13 to people but also being alone
00:09:16 has advantages of course  so all
00:09:20 my things I know where they are
00:09:23 I know that if I want a marker I know
00:09:27 that the marker is there I don't have to
00:09:30 look for the marker where is the
00:09:31 marker if there is no noise
00:09:39 [Music]
00:09:43 the same thing happens to me but
00:09:46 you  But if they are friends, if you get along
00:09:49 better with other people, not for me, the best thing
00:09:51 is to get to a new flat and with
00:09:56 new people and make friends there,
00:09:59 make friends if inside the flat, because
00:10:01 if you are already friends from before, of course, sometimes
00:10:04 the  relationship can change which someone
00:10:06 you are my friend wta good but you see him three
00:10:09 times a week but suddenly go
00:10:11 see him every day
00:10:13 at many hours on the plane he can charge
00:10:16 ions and stylized you realize that at
00:10:19 home inside the apartment is different than
00:10:23 when  you are friends outside a threat yes
00:10:25 it could also be me when I have
00:10:29 had the best experience sharing
00:10:32 a has been with new people people I
00:10:35 did not know before but inside the
00:10:37 apartment there was a very very good atmosphere it was very
00:10:42 accurate be very very good roller and  friends,

141,"00:00:03 now once upon a time
00:00:06 a
00:00:12 frog lived in a lake
00:00:16 lived in a lake a lake is full of
00:00:21 water water water
00:00:25 but it is not the sea
00:00:27 this is the sea the sea but this is not
00:00:31 smaller than the sea it is a lake
00:00:36 this frog was a  very good frog
00:00:40 because he always helped his friends
00:00:46 to cross the lake he helped other
00:00:50 animals for example mice
00:00:56 mice beetles
00:01:00 mice beetles caterpillars
00:01:05 a caterpillar is a bug they are all bugs it
00:01:08 is a bug that turns into a
00:01:13 butterfly
00:01:16 so the frog carried
00:01:21 them carried them  and he helped them cross
00:01:25 because the mice, the beetles, the
00:01:27 caterpillars can't swim but the frog is a
00:01:30 very good swimmer one day a
00:01:34 scorpion
00:01:38 came a scorpion came and said frog frog
00:01:42 help me cross to the other side and the
00:01:47 frog saw
00:01:50 it I don't know I don't know  I'm not sure
00:01:53 and the scorpion said but man, can't you see
00:01:57 that if I prick you we'll both die
00:02:02 so I'm not going to prick you
00:02:06 but the frog wasn't there I wasn't sure
00:02:09 and the scorpion asked him please
00:02:12 please come come  ga come on please
00:02:16 [Music]
00:02:18 come on finally
00:02:22 and finally the frog said okay okay okay
00:02:27 come on come on and the
00:02:32 scorpion climbed on top of the frog and they
00:02:36 began to cross cross cross and
00:02:40 when they were close they were close to
00:02:43 the  shore the scorpion
00:02:47 stung the frog and the frog asked him
00:02:52 I asked him scorpion why why
00:02:55 why have you stung me why are you stinging me
00:02:58 now we are both going to die
00:03:01 and the scorpion said it
00:03:05 is my nature I cannot help it
00:03:08 I am a  scorpion and scorpions
00:03:10 sting
00:03:12 and the frog the frog began to notice that its
00:03:18 arms and
00:03:22 legs were paralyzed but I made an
00:03:26 effort and it grabbed onto a branch I saw
00:03:31 a tree and the tree had branches
00:03:37 and leaves leaf two children
00:03:40 then there were  a branch and the frog the
00:03:44 frog
00:03:45 caught the branch and no it didn't die
00:03:49 but the scorpion
00:03:53 the scorpion was still here
00:03:55 trying to swim but scorpions can't
00:03:58 swim
00:04:00 and then a woman came a woman who
00:04:06 saw the scorpion
00:04:09 or a scorpion is drowning
00:04:14 When he caught it, he caught the scorpion but the
00:04:17 scorpion stung him and
00:04:21 he released it and the sporting fell back into the
00:04:26 water
00:04:26 saft that the woman was in pain but she did
00:04:31 n't catch it again and oh and he went
00:04:35 back to chop it
00:04:37 oysters I like to chop and  along the way
00:04:41 but here there was a path
00:04:44 and
00:04:49 a peasant came up a peasant and told the woman why do
00:04:53 you take the scorpion the scorpion
00:04:56 stings it's its nature it can't help it they
00:05:00 sting and the woman took a branch over here
00:05:05 there was a branch of a tree she
00:05:09 took  I rescued the branch and
00:05:14 rescued the scorpion and returned it to the
00:05:17 ground
00:05:19 and the woman said to the farmer yes I know it
00:05:24 is the nature of the scorpion to whistle
00:05:26 but my nature is to save it

373,"00:00:00 in this video I am going to talk about the
00:00:04 most popular traditional board game in
00:00:09 Spain
00:00:13 [Music]
00:00:16 Hello In this video I am going to talk about the
00:00:22 game
00:00:23 of the Goose this game is a
00:00:30 super popular traditional game in Spain Spanish children
00:00:35 love it Children love it
00:00:42 love to play this game the game of
00:00:47 the goose is a game of chance it is played with
00:00:52 a dice you
00:00:54 need a dice to play and you need
00:01:00 at least two
00:01:02 two players two people or more
00:01:07 if two or more people two or more
00:01:11 players each player has
00:01:16 one token  a token is a figurine or
00:01:22 a coin a small token each
00:01:27 player has a token and the tokens are
00:01:32 placed the tokens are placed on the
00:01:34 starting square square number 1
00:01:41 the game of the Goose has
00:01:44 63 squares
00:01:47 the game starts on square number 1
00:01:53 and ends in box number
00:01:57 63 each box has a different picture
00:02:05 and every five boxes there is a picture of
00:02:12 a Goose
00:02:14 this animal is a Goose a player rolls
00:02:20 the dice If the dice the player rolls the
00:02:24 dice
00:02:25 and counts one d
00:02:29 two three one two three four five
00:02:36 if the player lands on a square
00:02:59 then that player that player has
00:03:03 to roll the dice again if you land on
00:03:09 a goose it's good news because
00:03:13 you can move faster there are also
00:03:19 two squares with
00:03:22 the drawing of a bridge  a drawing of a
00:03:27 bridge
00:03:28 if the player falls on the bridge square he
00:03:33 has to say the phrase from
00:03:38 Bridge to Bridge and I shoot because
00:03:42 the current takes me So if you fall on this
00:03:47 bridge you go from Bridge to Bridge and
00:03:52 roll again but
00:03:55 if you fall on this  bridge you have to go
00:03:59 back
00:04:29 that they are not good that they are bad For
00:04:34 example
00:04:35 the inn The inn is a place where
00:04:41 a person
00:04:42 Rests on a long road a traveler
00:04:47 a person who travels Rests in the
00:04:51 inn if the player falls into the inn he
00:04:56 has to wait a  unplayed turn
00:05:01 Then the other player can roll the
00:05:06 die twice the player at the
00:05:10 inn has to wait if the player
00:05:14 lands on the jail space on that
00:05:20 player has to wait one too  or
00:05:25 two turns without playing he
00:05:29 is in jail he cannot advance he has
00:05:33 to wait it is not a good square
00:05:39 and the worst square is the death square
00:05:47 if a player
00:05:50 lands on the death square he has to
00:05:54 go back
00:05:56 to the exit square he has to
00:06:02 start the game again the first person the
00:06:07 first player to reach the last
00:06:11 square to square number 63
00:06:17 is the winner the winner of the game
00:06:22 of the Goose And that's all I really like

00:01:00 swollen because it is old it has
00:01:04 swollen and the screen has separated and
00:01:09 this time I do not want to pay so much money
00:01:14 and I have bought a cheaper battery that
00:01:20 costs less money and I am going to
00:01:25 change it
00:01:27 I have the iPhone
00:01:29 I have the battery
00:01:31 I have a tool kit
00:01:36 and I'm going to see let's see if this time it works
00:01:40 out for me because the last time
00:01:44 I tried to change the screen the screen

00:03:25 take the suction cup
00:03:28 with the suction cup, put it on the screen
00:03:34 and use it to rotate to lift the
00:03:40 screen and use a tool to
00:03:45 separate the screen.
00:04:09 there is a
00:04:14 tape there is a cable I have to remove the
00:04:18 connection
00:04:20 here ok now this has to be endured
00:04:25 so you have to stand up the
00:04:29 screen to
00:04:33 see seriously est  or it's difficult how am I going to
00:04:37 do it
00:04:38 well for now I'm going to put it like this
00:04:42 so I need
00:04:45 a phillips tip here a
00:04:49 smaller phillips tip
00:04:52 yes I'll try this one

00:04:59 here are two screws that I have to
00:05:02 remove here one

00:06:04 see with the tweezers
00:06:10 three three cables okay and here
00:06:16 We already only have the bottom part of the
00:06:20 iPhone here at the base of the battery there is
00:06:24 a tab there is a tab that you have to
00:06:28 remove to see here
00:06:33 you have to remove this tab
00:06:35 okay okay it comes out easy and this has  and what to
00:06:40 pull
00:06:42 and there are two strips
00:06:45 two strips of glue two strips that
00:06:49 stick together and you have to cut
00:06:53 this in 2 let's
00:06:58 see here you have to cut it in two
00:07:01 parts
00:07:02 good that's it it will separate
00:07:06 okay and you even have to stretch
00:07:11 you have to stretch from here  go pulling and
00:07:13 remove all the glue from underneath it looks like
00:07:17 a pizza looks like the cheese of a pizza you
00:07:20 don't
00:07:24 have to go pulling pulling pulling if it
00:07:28 is coming out or how curious I have changed
00:07:32 several mobile batteries if it is going
00:07:35 out
00:07:38 to see and see
00:07:42 and that's it and  It has come out, look, look,
00:07:46 and everything has come out, the entire strip I have
00:07:50 changed quite a few mobile batteries
00:07:52 but I have never seen something like this that
00:07:56 stretches and the entire strip of glue comes out
00:07:59 and the same with this one,
00:08:04 it has broken or it has broken, well,
00:08:09 let's go  Let's see let's see if we can take out
00:08:13 the battery yes the battery seems
00:08:17 inflated a little inflated yes yes let's see it's
00:08:22 working fine I'm going to try to take the
00:08:25 battery out
00:08:28 like this I'm bending it I'm bending the
00:08:32 battery I'm going to use alcohol I'm going to
00:08:35 put some alcohol
00:08:39 pair  It seems that the alcohol works well to
00:08:42 remove the glue so that the
00:08:47 glue can separate it, no,
00:08:53 ok, it's out, the battery has come out,
00:08:57 yes, it's a little bent, but
00:09:01 well, it hasn't learned fire, it hasn't caught
00:09:05 fire, so that's good, here we have
00:09:09 the strip  no strip of glue
00:09:14 ok well look this is an iphone without a
00:09:18 battery
00:09:20 very good ok then this is the
00:09:25 new battery the
00:09:26 new battery will go
00:09:29 here it will go here it will be connected
00:09:33 here
00:09:35 I am going to try just test that it connects
00:09:38 ok yes like that  that connects I'm going to
00:09:42 remove it
00:09:45 and here the battery will go with
00:09:50 glue
00:09:51 I think this is glue for the
00:09:54 battery yes
00:09:56 I don't know if it goes as it goes of course it has to be
00:10:01 on both sides so not
00:10:06 here it sticks
00:10:09 and then I remove it from here
00:10:12 I remove this that I remove yes no no no
00:10:18 how bad it is okay yes yes yes it stopped here this is
00:10:23 very good and this yes this sticks very well
00:10:28 then it sticks everything very well
00:10:31 okay then here yes I'm going to just
00:10:36 in case I'm going to connect the battery first that it
00:10:41 fits well
00:10:43 ok and oh  Now I'm going to put it in okay I think
00:10:49 it's fine in the future if I want to
00:10:52 take the battery out I can pull it here
00:10:55 pull this this plastic this
00:10:58 tab there is a tab I can't
00:11:01 pull here to get the battery out of
00:11:05 here fine but this has to be disconnected
00:11:09 First of all, because first I have to
00:11:12 connect the screen, then how was
00:11:17 the screen going? The screen first had
00:11:21 this connector here,
00:11:25 this is okay, we already have the three connectors
00:11:30 of the screen very well, and finally, the
00:11:34 connector of the taxi of the
00:11:39 fingerprint detector that a  see I don't know how

00:11:57 see
00:11:59 I'm going to do it okay okay no if not yes to
00:12:03 separate the screen first we separate the
00:12:07 bottom part  and then the top one

00:12:17 first the top part
00:12:24 I don't know
00:12:26 yes yes yes yes yes first the top part and
00:12:30 we're going to go down
00:12:32 v  Alright I think it's fine or not or I

00:13:05 and it's covered it goes here ok it
00:13:09 has a screw  and here it's okay
00:13:14 and another screw here this is the most
00:13:19 difficult very good and 22 plus
00:13:23 1
00:13:25 very good okay well it's covered and it's
00:13:30 just missing this one here and it was like this

00:13:49 use the tripod here and yes with the
00:13:53 good tripod I start to screw this one screwed it screwed it screwed it in
00:13:58 a little by itself and I put the
00:14:01 second one
00:14:03 the second screw goes here and this one
00:14:07 screwed it in well and then well it's okay
00:14:11 okay if that's it I don't have any more  things
00:14:16 again here I put this connector okay and
00:14:23 even the connector well connected and here
00:14:26 again we start at the top okay
00:14:31 and we go down we have to go fixing a
00:14:35 bit because the metal separates from the
00:14:37 plastic okay well it seems that it is
00:14:41 fine  ok now we just have to put these two
00:14:46 screws again we change the tip
00:14:50 of the screwdriver and again to put
00:14:53 these screws one
00:14:57 and 2
00:14:59 very well
00:15:02 the two screws are already
00:15:04 there so I don't know if it will turn on
00:15:09 because I don't know if the battery is charged
00:15:13 let's go  Let's see, let's
00:15:16 see
00:15:19 if it has turned on, well, something has turned on, it
00:15:23 's something that works for now, I haven't
00:15:28 broken it, it's a good sign, okay, it works,
00:15:33 the phone works, so if the
00:15:36 screen already looked bad before, but
00:15:40 well, it seems to work, I'll have  I have to
00:15:43 use it a bit to see if the battery,
00:15:47 well, no, I mean, the battery will not
00:15:52 last, but at least the phone
00:15:55 is fine, the battery is not swollen, it
00:15:59 should be a safer battery, it will not
00:16:02 explode at any moment, well, that
00:16:06 's fine.  I have fixed my

",2
328,"00:00:00 Well, today I'm going to show you this box. Yes,
00:00:06 in this box I have something that
00:00:10 I liked, I really liked to play,
00:00:15 I liked to play when I was
00:00:18 little.
00:00:35 lots and today today I am going to show you
00:00:39 how to play with the tazos ok
00:00:43 then what are the tazos the tazos are
00:00:47 these round
00:00:50 these round
00:00:52 with which you can play a game a game was
00:00:55 played
00:00:56 I see that there are these also super caps I
00:00:59 don't know  if
00:01:01 these people played in the usa or something
00:01:04 but they seem very american the
00:01:09 initials at least the ones that I
00:01:11 remember at the beginning I don't know if I don't know if
00:01:15 there will be any it seems to me that there are few
00:01:17 there are more of others of other types or  no
00:01:20 chance maximum gore
00:01:23 well in general the tazos came for free they
00:01:28 were free they cost 00 euros or well at
00:01:34 that time they were 00 pesetas
00:01:38 we still didn't have euros and they came with
00:01:41 the bags of chips when you bought
00:01:44 a bag of potato chips I would
00:01:48 eat you  s the potatoes and inside there was a
00:01:52 bowl no so I remember that I
00:01:56 remember the originals were those that say
00:02:00 cup simply put cup and they
00:02:03 were blue it may be that these
00:02:06 also had been copied from others in
00:02:10 another country but in Spain the first
00:02:13 we saw  They were these, they were the
00:02:15 blue polos and then
00:02:18 many other types came out, but
00:02:22 hey I'm going to explain first the
00:02:26 original way of playing how we played with
00:02:29 them
00:02:30 and then I'll explain all the
00:02:33 other types so how the polos were played,
00:02:37 well let's say  you always always
00:02:42 have to play several people with other
00:02:44 people it can be two people not two
00:02:48 people
00:02:50 or more two or more it can be 234
00:02:56 whatever if you are two people each person
00:03:00 puts a saucepan puts one and then you turn
00:03:05 ice each person has to try
00:03:08 to hit them  turn them around like this
00:03:11 then as you turn them you turn them
00:03:16 around with a bow with your cup another
00:03:19 stroke you take and throw it away like that
00:03:25 it has not worked  I swim
00:03:26 [Music]
00:03:30 and I have forgotten I have forgotten the
00:03:32 technique
00:03:35 very well I have turned it around I have already
00:03:37 turned the bowl around
00:03:39 as I have turned this stroke I keep
00:03:42 it I win it that's it I already have
00:03:45 a  bowl and now there is only one
00:03:49 left there is only one saucepan left so to
00:03:53 win this bowl you cannot do this
00:03:57 no because you will never never
00:04:00 turn it over well sometimes yes if the line is
00:04:04 bent it is kind of bent it can't
00:04:09 be yes but if the  the line is flat no
00:04:13 so what we did was put the
00:04:16 point below here and do like this
00:04:21 yes now well I have not won it
00:04:24 the other person can play
00:04:27 and does it
00:04:29 until I turn
00:04:33 it over no I have not got it right now I have
00:04:37 won the  bowl then you can play
00:04:41 two cues but you can play many you
00:04:45 can make piles with a lot of data
00:04:49 you can play many people and
00:04:53 when there are many cues it's more
00:04:55 fun because you can throw
00:05:02 you can't turn many to
00:05:06 many cues the basic game  mind is
00:05:09 this sometimes if you have 22 pogs like this they
00:05:14 are separated you can also use this
00:05:19 technique throw the straight line like this
00:05:26 good like this it's a bit difficult but it's
00:05:29 another technique you can't throw flat you
00:05:34 can throw sideways with the edge hit
00:05:37 the edge and  So there are different types
00:05:42 of mugs there are the normal mugs mug that
00:05:46 puts mug and in the normal strokes there are
00:05:49 characters from warner bros not so
00:05:54 characters from warner bros from warner
00:05:58 then there are the super bowl super bowl the
00:06:03 super bowl are green green and
00:06:06 there are others  Tasmanian characters Tasmanian characters
00:06:10 from I don't know if you remember, it's
00:06:13 also a Warner's character, it's
00:06:17 a demon, a Tasmanian devil, not the
00:06:20 Tasmanian devil, it's an animal from an
00:06:22 island in Australia, there were other
00:06:25 cartoons where there's not
00:06:28 the devil here  from tasmania that we have
00:06:32 the most mega tazos mega tazo are called mega
00:06:35 but they are the same size and there are
00:06:39 the characters of the moon looney
00:06:45 tunes looney tunes
00:06:48 another other the same and  This is the same, there are
00:06:51 also Looney Tunes, all of these are
00:06:53 mega mega tacos,
00:06:56 so there are many others, there are paper ones,
00:07:00 there are several paper ones, but nobody
00:07:04 likes tazos, the paper tacos are made
00:07:08 of paper, they are not plastic, what else are there
00:07:16 pokemon tazos  tazos are not called
00:07:20 poke tazos well those of the pokemon that
00:07:23 there are, well, all the pokemon all the
00:07:25 numbers of the pokemon and behind it
00:07:28 is a pokemon what there is the most the most
00:07:32 dictated the most dictated
00:07:35 are beautiful because they have several
00:07:38 systems to see if they are  so they have several
00:07:43 images what happens that they are very soft they
00:07:46 are soft they
00:07:48 do not go they do not go well to play to
00:07:52 play polos what else there is then there is this
00:07:55 style
00:07:56 these are from the shin chan me from the shin chan
00:07:58 from the shin chan nooo I don't remember no and
00:08:02 then there are these of these yes I
00:08:03 remember the power rangers these
00:08:07 are not round no these are octagonal they
00:08:11 have 888 sides they have 12345678 but
00:08:21 well just like these have notches
00:08:24 here they have notches to fit the
00:08:28 they cannot fit together and they can be built it
00:08:31 's a bit like legos the same as
00:08:34 legos you can build things here
00:08:38 very very big things you
00:08:41 can't here you can go
00:08:44 assembling things and also
00:08:47 with these you can play another game
00:08:51 you can take another line  put it here
00:08:55 and put it here and shoot it
00:09:01 yes and this was fun but no I don't remember I
00:09:05 don't remember what we played if
00:09:07 we really played with them
00:09:09 somehow or just hit your friends
00:09:13 in the head no for if that was
00:09:16 fun that to me  I liked there were
00:09:19 cases there were these cases to
00:09:22 carry your data here well there are a lot
00:09:25 a lot of cups that there were more there
00:09:28 were the super bowls the super bowls to
00:09:32 see where there is where there is a super bowl or
00:09:36 look at the tip
00:09:38 or they come out one by one yes inside here
00:09:41 yes  you hear it
00:09:45 there is a spring spring that pushes them
00:09:49 up this is cool I like
00:09:53 here the super bowl psss the super
00:09:56 data with the super bowl is played the same
00:09:59 but they are very thick yes and it is  Let's see,
00:10:03 you also put a lot here,
00:10:07 they are also the characters from warner
00:10:10 bros and you put a pile and with another one with
00:10:16 another non-master super bowl, they are called
00:10:19 masters, masters and masters, not super
00:10:22 dice cases with another master bowl, well, you don't
00:10:25 have to put them with  the letters the
00:10:30 letters up and then you played
00:10:33 anyway you threw like this and
00:10:37 I won one come again with these
00:10:42 I think I could also stretch like this throw
00:10:45 straight
00:10:47 well another one I already have 22 cues no I
00:10:53 won many cues playing playing with
00:10:58 my friends I won the most  I won almost all of
00:11:00 the ones here I didn't eat
00:11:05 many many fries no no
00:11:09 fries
00:11:11 I didn't eat many most almost all of
00:11:15 these tacos I won playing playing
00:11:19 with my friends and the last one the last
00:11:23 type of tacos are these the macro ones  tazos

00:12:09 well I have turned it around I have won I
00:12:12 won this one was played the same but it is more
00:12:16 difficult to play with the macro tazos and

00:00:10 birthday and as you know I
00:00:14 'm married I'm married
00:00:18 to my wife I
00:00:21 had a gift and this gift
00:00:28 [Music] well
00:00:34 yes she gave me puzzles yes
00:00:44 because my wife my wife knows that to me
00:00:49 I like them I like puzzles so
00:00:53 today today I'm going to try to
00:00:58 solve these puzzles okay come
00:01:04 first the puzzles to assemble you have
00:01:07 to know how to assemble and to
00:01:11 make it more fun I'm not going to look
00:01:15 I'm not going to look how how it's made I'm going
00:01:25 I'm going to separate it and then I'll try to assemble it when I assemble it so yes yes I'm going to look yes yes and
00:01:29 I'm going to see how I don't know how I can
00:01:32 disassemble it I can disassemble it without looking
00:01:36 but I'm going to look at you
00:01:39 here here are the instructions and
00:01:42 then I'm not going to look anymore and it can't be
00:01:46 separated easily without looking I don't know
00:01:50 maybe I have a look look
00:01:53 if not maybe I have to look
00:01:56 to separate it to see here it breaks I
00:02:01 don't know I don't know c  How beware or how to separate it, let's
00:02:05 see,
00:02:08 well, that's it, this is this is the
00:02:11 puzzle to disassemble it, it's also a bean bag, it
00:02:15 's a puzzle, so let's see, let's see
00:02:17 how it can be done here, this piece
00:02:21 seems to come out, but
00:02:26 no, no.  no and this piece if it comes out to see let's
00:02:31 see
00:02:33 no no it doesn't come out and let's see it is there until
00:02:38 there maybe it may be that they are coming out
00:02:41 a little little by little a little little by little
00:02:44 they are coming out no
00:02:50 I don't know I don't know how to do it may be
00:02:54 that  there is something
00:02:58 I don't know I don't know I don't know if there is a part
00:03:01 that has to be removed first or you have to
00:03:05 remove it all little by little little by little
00:03:13 I'm not giving up I'm giving up no I can't it could be
00:03:17 that later on I'll repeat
00:03:20 it again  do for now I'm going to try
00:03:24 I'm going to try this one
00:03:27 to see
00:03:29 how it works
00:03:32 and I'm not going to look at the
00:03:35 instructions either
00:03:39 I don't know if it can be disassembled
00:03:42 if it doesn't seem like it will be able to be disassembled there
00:03:45 must be something somewhere that
00:03:48 can be moved  it can be moved and this
00:03:52 part here moves this stick  It is all made of
00:03:56 wood, they are not wooden sticks and inside
00:04:00 there is a ball there is a wooden ball
00:04:04 also
00:04:07 look look
00:04:10 and see
00:04:13 where it is I have lost it no I can't
00:04:16 find it
00:04:18 there is one that moves this one moves this
00:04:22 one does not move but it does move  move
00:04:26 because
00:04:29 you
00:04:30 can get out if this can be moved like that
00:04:36 ok ok ok and he has found the trick
00:04:39 and what's next next is to
00:04:43 move it's hard to turn it's hard to
00:04:49 turn this one too
00:04:52 because yes I think so yes yes it's going to turn
00:04:55 a little more  a little more
00:04:58 a little more
00:05:01 I don't need two I have to turn two if
00:05:05 not you can't
00:05:08 what buildings
00:05:10 okay it's already turned okay I know how to
00:05:15 do it be here
00:05:18 be here and let's see let's
00:05:25 see this one comes out ok this one comes out this one comes
00:05:30 out here
00:05:32 and  now very easy no these two also
00:05:35 come out the ball I already have an
00:05:39 extra wooden ball here it's not easy
00:05:45 it's not easy to get them out no no I don't think
00:05:49 I have to turn again and
00:05:53 this one here like this
00:05:57 one
00:06:01 3 come and do it  last and again the same
00:06:06 good up to now  All right, since it's dirty, it
00:06:13 's dirty,
00:06:15 that's fine, that's
00:06:18 it, I'm done, no, I wouldn't have to go
00:06:22 back, I'll assemble it again, and if you pay attention, if you
00:06:27 see it, these are different, they are not, they are not the
00:06:31 same, no,
00:06:33 so there is an order, there is a certain
00:06:36 order to assemble them.
00:06:39 and that order let's see how we start first
00:06:44 3
00:06:50 this piece this piece is different it is
00:06:54 not it is not the same to see
00:06:57 there are three types three types of pieces
00:07:02 the one that is fine not so fine and thicker
00:07:08 the one that is thick and thick like this one and
00:07:11 this one
00:07:13 fine  and thick but these are also
00:07:16 different
00:07:18 are if they are different if they are different
00:07:23 and these are also different they have a
00:07:26 notch here notch and notch look inside
00:07:30 or notch outside
00:07:32 and then there it is this is the only piece
00:07:36 I think it is the only one that has two has
00:07:41 two  fine
00:07:44 so how do we do this
00:07:48 outside outside inside inside
00:07:52 and this is difficult
00:07:55 I'm going to try I'm going to try one thing I'm going to
00:07:59 always take
00:08:01 the one that is most difficult the most difficult piece
00:08:06 not always the thickest piece
00:08:10 thickest no n  or finer
00:08:13 whenever I can take these if I
00:08:19 can't take these and if I can't then
00:08:23 don't come from these we'll
00:08:24 start but I don't know I don't know whether to
00:08:28 take this one or these first
00:08:37 I don't know I don't know how to do it I'll look at
00:08:41 the instructions let's start  At the end
00:08:47 this one has
00:08:50 straight on one side straight to fine here fine
00:08:54 and up
00:08:58 up notch look up or out
00:09:04 like this no and then another like this and two more
00:09:10 two more how are you
00:09:14 here here one and here another if these
00:09:21 four go like this
00:09:26 for yes
00:09:29 okay
00:09:32 okay I don't know I don't know why I think they
00:09:39 are these oops you're with outside outside outside
00:09:45 like this there
00:09:46 will be
00:09:49 here
00:09:53 okay like this here there is also space there is a
00:09:56 space here
00:09:57 what goes here also on the outside I
00:10:00 don't need the ones that have samples on the
00:10:02 outside
00:10:06 so that  come down here
00:10:11 ok and this outwards it moves
00:10:17 outwards well it has some rules there are
00:10:22 certain rules but it's difficult here it's
00:10:28 very difficult
00:10:31 to see it
00:10:34 turns it turns it's worth
00:10:39 the ball
00:10:42 2 more here the two these the two
00:10:46 finer than I think  yes no
00:10:52 just  like this
00:10:54 ah
00:10:57 like this
00:11:00 normal
00:11:01 and okay we're finishing yes yes
00:11:06 now these fit how they fit they have
00:11:10 to fit well it doesn't fit
00:11:13 very well and here we close it we
00:11:18 close
00:11:21 and
00:11:24 close it
00:11:27 's more difficult
00:11:32 is that there was already one that was
00:11:35 already difficult at the beginning to separate it has  It
00:11:38 has been difficult
00:11:42 I swear that this is so this is so but it
00:11:47 is very very hard it is very hard
00:11:51 [Music]
00:11:52 we are going to accept that well it is not
00:11:55 perfect it is a little good a little like that
00:11:59 no but but well this is the solution
00:12:03 is the solution
00:12:07 This one is not very well made, it is not very
00:12:10 well, very well made, no, but well,
00:12:14 we are going to forget it and we are going to
00:12:18 do other simpler ones.
00:12:31 I'm going to look okay
00:12:34 then here this
00:12:38 I have to take out I have to take out this hoop
00:12:43 don't be hoop you can't get out of here
00:12:46 let's see what we're going to do
00:12:50 here I can take this out I can't take
00:12:54 this out
00:12:55 but now this won't come out this won't come out no
00:13:00 then  What can I do? Well, if it was
00:13:03 like this,
00:13:05 I can try to put this in,
00:13:10 no,
00:13:12 and
00:13:15 now it's worse, it's even worse, well,
00:13:18 I'm not going to put this in,
00:13:21 how do you take it out? This is
00:13:25 okay,
00:13:27 and now I have to remove the cord from the
00:13:31 cord. Here's the problem, so let's see.
00:13:35 how can I do it
00:13:39 how difficult not
00:13:41 to try let's try like this and then here
00:13:45 what is what is the idea
00:13:50 I think I have an idea because that's how
00:13:55 it comes out like this it comes out and the balls the
00:14:00 balls yes yes they do go through the hoop
00:14:04 ok but  this this no this does not go through
00:14:07 the ring
00:14:08 so I have to make this this
00:14:13 part go through the ring
00:14:17 to see what I can do with the cord
00:14:21 it is not the same it is the same as before
00:14:31 okay I am going to try something to see let's see
00:14:35 how to see  how
00:14:39 am I going to try putting this here
00:14:46 now we have a ball a ball here and
00:14:51 this on this side what else can you
00:14:55 do
00:15:00 or that
00:15:01 's it I've already done
00:15:05 it I don't know how I did it but something
00:15:09 like that not passing it to this side
00:15:13 and I think  I already have it, I already know, I know how to
00:15:18 do it, I don't know if it's like that
00:15:24 Sanding the ball here
00:15:29 and this one here it
00:15:33 stays like this it gives you the ball on one side no and
00:15:37 then passing this one over here
00:15:41 it is already very well achieved and I am very
00:15:47 very proud I am very proud of
00:15:50 myself I am I am happy
00:15:53 come one more this I think  I think it will be
00:15:57 similar it will be similar to the previous one
00:16:00 so we have a ball here
00:16:05 and if the ball is the only thing that moves
00:16:10 then I think we have to take
00:16:15 out the ball not to see how to see how
00:16:19 we do it
00:16:22 the ball is here
00:16:24 and
00:16:26 oh okay  you have to remove everything remove the
00:16:30 cord the cord and the ball then
00:16:43 next to get out get out of this
00:16:53 ok it's already
00:16:55 uff how complicated what has been achieved
00:17:01 don't ask me don't ask me how
00:17:08 this one got
00:17:10 it I mean I don't know how it's done it's
00:17:14 interesting  It's very small, very very
00:17:17 small, I'm going to see if I can
00:17:20 do it, to see help from
00:17:23 relatives who don't come out, what do I have to
00:17:27 do, I have to open it, it's worth,
00:17:32 what are the melts, to know,
00:17:37 I don't know, I don't understand anything,
00:17:40 it doesn't matter.
00:17:43 star similar to a
00:17:47 star
00:17:49 and
00:17:50 it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem very difficult but
00:17:55 let's see let's see it's
00:18:00 already in this one all the pieces
00:18:05 are the same and they only fit together the
00:18:10 way to open it to open it is to
00:18:13 pick it up only from one place and
00:18:18 make it vibrate  vibrate
00:18:21 move it like this not to put it together it's more
00:18:25 difficult I think we're going to do it by putting
00:18:30 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 parts very well so I think I
00:18:36 think it's like this be here be
00:18:39 here
00:18:41 6 s something like this and then be here and then
00:18:47 the last  haha the last piece is the most
00:18:51 difficult it's difficult because here you have to
00:18:54 open it you don't have to open it
00:18:56 oops not so much don't open it so much
00:18:59 you have to open it to put this
00:19:02 piece yes
00:19:05 and put it inside
00:19:09 open 'open sesame' you have to open
00:19:12 but open don't open too much  there is no
00:19:17 now yes no
00:19:20 no no no
00:19:43 yes yes
00:19:46 yes yes yes yes yes more or less more or less
00:19:50 yes finally well I have cheated you have
00:19:55 looked at the clues the clues to see
00:20:00 it is not very clear neither does it explain very
00:20:02 clearly what to do
00:20:05 but hey  I have understood what  You have to
00:20:07 put together 33 pieces and then,
00:20:11 well, it's not clear, but I put together three
00:20:14 three and then three more and I've done it like that, no,
00:20:18 and then yes, it has worked,
00:20:21 yes, finally, very well, here is the
00:20:26 star for the last one, the last one is the
00:20:31 first.  It's this one but I really don't know I don't
00:20:34 know what to do I already know I know how to do it
00:20:38 and it's not it's not in the instructions
00:20:41 in the instructions no it doesn't put it but
00:20:45 there's something here I've seen I've seen something
00:20:51 I need a cop
00:20:53 moneyball and you see it's coming out
00:20:59 I need something to push
00:21:02 well until they are removed
00:21:06 and now disassembling it will be easier not
00:21:10 to see this one can come out well come out this one
00:21:15 for example and now I know very very easy to
00:21:17 disassemble it I don't know if I'm looking
00:21:26 very well
00:21:28 so how can I tell it guys
00:21:32 there is also this company  sawdust the sawdust
00:21:36 there are remains of wood ok I'm not going to look
00:21:40 I'm not going I'm not going to look how how to do it
00:21:44 I'm going to try to assemble it so this
00:21:49 fits here not
00:21:53 here in glasses and how does it fit if it fits
00:21:58 sorry I did it when I was little  of the
00:22:03 round ones not
00:22:05 round squares
00:22:08 stars triangles if I wasn't
00:22:14 very, very good at it
00:22:16 we're not going to see how we can do this
00:22:20 this one has a spout it has a red dick two
00:22:25 dicks and two holes no then
00:22:30 where can the rosso dicks go
00:22:34 these ros dicks  they have to go or in the
00:22:37 center
00:22:39 somewhere in the center here not
00:22:44 here no
00:22:45 not on one side no this would be one side this
00:22:48 is one side this this is a safe side
00:22:50 these are the two are sides of the cube not
00:22:55 of the cube is a cube  of 3 x 3 3 3 like a
00:23:00 rubik's cube not of 3 3 x 3 so
00:23:05 these are the two sides of the cube for sure
00:23:11 so this
00:23:13 these are sides but this and this we don't
00:23:18 know here it can go it can go in the
00:23:22 center
00:23:25 or it can go in  one side
00:23:28 can go here not here no
00:23:34 but
00:23:35 I don't know this is one side yes and
00:23:40 here not here can't
00:23:43 here yes it can go on one side this but the
00:23:46 other is here can't go
00:23:52 here can't go here yes here yes it
00:23:56 can go  so this this is not
00:24:00 possible that it does not fit this a no this does not
00:24:04 go either
00:24:07 no no no  it can be it's impossible this
00:24:12 has to go in the middle this has to go
00:24:15 in the brain in the center of something no
00:24:19 if this goes in the center
00:24:22 could yes which ones can go in this one
00:24:27 can't go in this here no can't go
00:24:32 this can't be  in the center this
00:24:35 one can be in the center this one
00:24:37 can't you can't
00:24:40 wait wait we need one more
00:24:44 that can go in the center
00:24:46 there are no more pieces I have lost I have lost
00:24:49 a piece no no
00:24:52 no no here are all the pieces
00:24:56 so what else  can go in the center
00:25:01 to this I'm in the center but here it
00:25:04 can't go what else can go in the
00:25:07 center well this is too long
00:25:11 this is too long this is
00:25:15 too long this can go but there is
00:25:18 no hole here there is no hole so
00:25:21 vertical  no good we go back to the
00:25:26 theory of the side of being this on one side
00:25:31 it is on one side it can be here yes
00:25:35 this yes it can be time it can go like this or it
00:25:40 can go like this
00:25:44 if so so so and there are many many
00:25:52 options how difficult is it worth issues
00:25:58 I have told that with  they took how many
00:26:01 squares how many squares one two three
00:26:05 four five no and there are 26 there is 26 16
00:26:14 there is not 27 does not mean means
00:26:19 that there is no center in the cube there is no
00:26:22 center there is nothing here there is nothing in the
00:26:25 middle no then all are all sides
00:26:30 they are sides of the cube
00:26:33 what does that mean no I don't know but well
00:26:37 this is one side one side for sure
00:26:42 I think I already have it cc
00:26:50 yes it's perfect
00:26:58 uff all the puzzles are there
00:27:01 well this one is gone I don't know I don't know what it is

00:04:45 fabbro t
00:04:47 or the woman
00:04:50 what are you doing here
00:04:54 he has some strange hands guys
00:04:58 ok it reminds me of the texts it
00:05:01 reminds me of the smoke monster
00:05:04 over there I'm not going I'm going to go to another
00:05:07 place
00:05:09 oil oil does or I have I have the
00:05:12 strength I have the strength
00:05:15 ok a face of p  stone let's
00:05:20 see it
00:05:22 looks like a receptacle for something I have
00:05:25 something to put there
00:05:28 to our solution it's good coins no
00:05:33 I don't think I don't think it's anything like that
00:05:36 and I don't want to go there but there is
00:05:39 no other open door here is a
00:05:42 fire
00:05:43 and there is a face  Let's see what
00:05:46 the stone face tells
00:05:50 me, it's going to scare me, right, okay, she
00:05:54 has those six gold coins. Do you want to
00:05:57 pay the price of two gold coins?
00:06:01 Who is she?
00:06:13 place I want to
00:06:16 know this place I would like to leave
00:06:19 here a sanctuary a safe harbor
00:06:23 to protect the pillars the pillars and
00:06:26 keep them protected from the outside world
00:06:30 this has almost used up the oil I would have
00:06:32 to turn off the lamp when
00:06:35 I am in a room with light so I
00:06:37 save  Ok so I save oil
00:06:41 what happened to you that you disappeared
00:06:45 okay
00:06:48 okay only until that door is open I
00:06:50 don't want to go to that door to see if there is gold here it
00:06:53 seems that the gold is going well the
00:06:55 coins  they are
00:06:58 useful I can exchange them for information so
00:07:01 it's a good idea to take the coins but
00:07:04 for now there aren't any and it's no use
00:07:07 putting coins here right there have coins
00:07:11 give me give me 1
00:07:14 no I can't take the coins I can't
00:07:17 put them anywhere ok here it
00:07:21 seems  Like there could be another
00:07:25 stone face but there isn't
00:07:30 and there is a well the
00:07:34 well there is nothing in the well okay well
00:07:39 let's go this way I don't want to
00:07:42 find the ghost but
00:07:45 but I know the only way
00:07:50 there is someone breathing this I don't like
00:07:55 ok I have a map
00:07:59 if this is more or less ok
00:08:04 ok

00:08:12 hello
00:08:13 lockpicks another wrong text
00:08:20 now it has fallen silent I don't hear
00:08:23 anything
00:08:25 a door is opening
00:08:28 to see
00:08:31 gold oil here there is nothing
00:08:34 to see in the text that  tell me first i
00:08:38 was confused in my head i had
00:08:40 pulses and felt nauseated and it took a
00:08:45 long afternoon to open my cell door
00:08:48 the other cells were empty
00:08:50 but i heard weird sounds coming from the
00:08:53 corridors it sounded like someone  I
00:08:55 was whispering
00:09:00 Vettel I don't want to okay still here there is a
00:09:05 corridor I can go ahead here is
00:09:08 the ghost woman right and what is there here
00:09:13 there is something on the plate
00:09:17 and that's it there is nothing else it has reached
00:09:18 the end there is an eye
00:09:22 there is an eye here
00:09:26 we have gold
00:09:28 we have these three pieces of gold 1 2 3
00:09:34 I'm going to take the eye a human eye to a
00:09:37 human eye I wasn't going to do a course I
00:09:41 'm going to go I'm going to get out of here
00:09:43 quickly just in case
00:09:44 that looks like indiana jones and this is where
00:09:47 the huge ball comes from the side
00:09:54 and some noise that is scary
00:09:59 okay for now
00:10:04 I hear a welcome
00:10:12 ballan look he tells you catch an eye catch
00:10:16 the inventor's eye and put it here he already
00:10:18 gives you clues
00:10:22 okay keep an eye I have opened that door  ok well
00:10:25 it seems
00:10:29 ok there is another ghost that battles
00:10:34 maybe with each plate a door will open
00:10:37 and three doors maximum
00:10:41 well hopefully that will be at the
00:10:43 end of the game
00:10:45 I will
00:10:47 I will see if I find one
00:10:52 I have reached another as if it were  a
00:10:55 completely different area  I
00:10:57 can go back I can't go to where I was before
00:11:01 come on
00:11:03 I'm going to hurry a little so I do
00:11:05 n't run out of oil
00:11:08 here is another corridor
00:11:12 this is very different from the corridors they
00:11:13 are different from before breathing
00:11:18 there is some bug some monster
00:11:21 don't eat me
00:11:23 our
00:11:25 now
00:11:28 ok
00:11:31 this is big this is quite big
00:11:36 and this is already running out the oil
00:11:42 don't eat me well if it's a
00:11:44 big monster I can get in here and there isn't
00:11:47 much space for it to eat me
00:11:50 here we have
00:11:58 to find here
00:12:01 breathing again oh oh ok here  Yes,
00:12:05 there is light, there is little light, on the other side,
00:12:11 or on the side,
00:12:13 uh,
00:12:16 don't look at it,
00:12:18 don't look at it, it's worth paying two coins on
00:12:23 the creatures,
00:12:27 okay, well,
00:12:29 don't look at it, I don't have to look at it
00:12:32 directly if I see it,

00:03:12 then marc and asks
00:03:16 him to  write to write it to him
00:03:20 then marc and he reads it I read it he says it he
00:03:24 tries to say it but of course it is very
00:03:27 different he does not say something very very different
00:03:31 and this continues this continues asking and
00:03:35 writing trying to say things continues
00:03:39 for two years for 22 years  s
00:03:45 but Marie still doesn't understand a lot
00:03:50 and the other people the other people
00:03:54 when they hear it they
00:03:57 don't understand or don't understand it well
00:04:02 Marí Marí is frustrated she goes to a school

00:04:22 and sea and he never really gets there he never
00:04:25 gets to be able to speak thai well
00:04:28 then there is the family
00:04:33 story the zombie story
00:04:35 also comes comes from a village from a

00:04:55 went to the town to her husband's
00:05:00 town and in this town they speak another language a
00:05:04 completely different language
00:05:07 in this town there is no  people

00:05:37 goes hunting not and zombie so alive with
00:05:44 the other women with the women of the
00:05:47 village he is working not working with

00:05:53 talking at night
00:05:57 at night all  they sit they sit
00:06:00 in the fire in the fire and they talk and
00:06:05 explain stories they tell stories
00:06:08 to me
00:06:10 zombie just goes with the others he
00:06:14 lives the same way as the others
00:06:17 after a year after a year
00:06:21 he already understands everything he understands more or
00:06:25 least everything not almost almost everything almost
00:06:30 100 percent of what he hears he
00:06:33 understands and could say could say
00:06:36 some words some short sentences
00:06:41 after two years after two years
00:06:47 zombie already spoke spoke fluently
00:06:49 spoke without problems and after 34
00:06:55 He was also the same as the
00:07:01 other people in town It was hard It
00:07:05 was hard to realize that zombie
00:07:09 was not from that town He was not a person from
00:07:11 this town
00:07:13 and these stories the story of  mar and
00:07:17 the zombie story
00:07:19 teach us the
00:07:22 difference between the ways of
00:07:26 learning languages ​​and how we can
00:07:31 learn a better language no and it does

00:12:34 jurassic park what can I do I can't
00:12:38 do anything I can't move
00:12:45 but I think I'm moving a
00:12:47 little and it gives me a little bit and it doesn't
00:12:52 go away
00:12:54 it goes away ok now
00:13:04 if I move  when he doesn't look
00:13:07 when he goes there I move he
00:13:21 has survived
00:13:23 let's go
00:13:25 so scary that has been very difficult
00:13:28 very bad
00:13:31 birds let's
00:13:33 see what I have
00:13:36 well let's look at the rest of the map
00:13:40 the lady scares me less the lady
00:13:43 at least I can run I can go
00:13:45 running
00:13:56 here I was  is seen not the lady and behind
00:14:00 I think it's not right nothing happens hasn't
00:14:03 looked here we reached the end or an
00:14:10 eye finally
00:14:11 good this time they have killed me twice
00:14:16 but finally we already have it we
00:14:19 have the eye
00:14:22 here and the last one is missing  screen the
00:14:26 last one is but I hope it's the last
00:14:29 coins I don't use the coins the only
00:14:33 thing he uses is oil for the lamp
00:14:37 ok ok
00:14:40 we have oil not only there are coins it's
00:14:46 already making noises weird noises
00:14:51 come on I think it's the last one I hope I
00:14:55 hope it's  The last one
00:14:57 I'm already looking down for the lady
00:15:00 although in the corridors I think that
00:15:02 normally the corridors are not the
00:15:04 lady not here nothing
00:15:09 nothing is worth
00:15:17 here she is beginning to see
00:15:20 several corridors here nothing bad
00:15:26 and I already heard a noise
00:15:29 let's go where there is no  noise is
00:15:35 worth
00:15:38 a door to see
00:15:43 oops
00:15:45 it has been closed
00:15:47 that is
00:15:49 good or bad
00:15:53 nothing good
00:15:56 lock picks that I don't use either the truth
00:16:01 well nothing is closed only the
00:16:03 door was like there was wind it was not
00:16:06 windy and here a wide corridor that
00:16:10 tamp  oco I really like the wide corridors
00:16:13 and there are many things here
00:16:16 we are going to go here word
00:16:22 here to
00:16:26 landlines sometimes
00:16:27 go go button uy
00:16:33 I have nothing to hurt you
00:16:40 nothing
00:16:41 has already tired
00:16:44 over there this will turn around or what
00:16:49 not I think it will turn around  back so I'm going
00:16:51 to go here first
00:16:53 I'm going to get in here the safest are the
00:16:55 narrow corridors
00:16:57 and here again
00:17:01 there is no oil it's good I like the
00:17:05 oil the oil is the only thing
00:17:07 I really need
00:17:09 and here
00:17:11 I
00:17:16 don't hope you won't open the door
00:17:21 this monster
00:17:24 is like a demon it
00:17:27 seems that if what protects me from him
00:17:29 are the doors if I close the door that
00:17:32 's
00:17:33 it I say it that's why you hear a lot
00:17:36 I'm going to lower the volume here
00:17:40 bad it's
00:17:42 still here
00:17:43 dt
00:17:49 if I hear it
00:17:53 go away
00:17:58 I
00:18:00 do
00:18:03 n't know  I suppose I have to do with
00:18:10 this this monster goes away like this he turned off the light
00:18:13 well at least when they kill you they
00:18:17 kill you once they explain what to do that
00:18:20 you can change so they don't kill you
00:18:23 okay well I have to turn off the lamp if I turn it
00:18:26 off  no me ma  tará ok
00:18:31 lock picks is here there is no my door we did not
00:18:35 start with a door
00:18:38 well it is good to know how not to die with
00:18:42 the devil because now it will make me less
00:18:44 less afraid before I was very afraid
00:18:47 of the devil
00:18:49 look again look statues here
00:18:51 this also seems random this
00:18:55 Also, I hadn't seen it before,
00:18:59 barrels,
00:19:01 potatoes, a coin of oil, okay. I think
00:19:06 that in these big places
00:19:08 there are never monsters, there are never enemies.
00:19:12 Well, come on, let's see what we find,
00:19:17 and the devil is always in these
00:19:20 narrow corridors,
00:19:23 but hey, it has to be a bit  long
00:19:25 and I have to turn off the light when you
00:19:29 find it okay here nothing here nothing
00:19:37 here I know there is a room
00:19:39 oil and coins
00:19:42 I don't know if the light is of any use well of
00:19:44 course so there is light
00:19:46 to see a bit and here is another face
00:19:51 he is noise  It's the lady's face, do
00:19:54 n't be afraid, okay, there's nothing else
00:19:57 here, well, we'll go through here
00:20:03 to see that there is
00:20:06 a door and another door, and
00:20:13 a longer corridor here,
00:20:16 okay  for now we are going to go into these
00:20:23 there is nothing
00:20:25 there is nothing seriously
00:20:27 it
00:20:28 is not worth anything
00:20:31 next here
00:20:37 nothing for now the lady here who speaks is
00:20:43 okay
00:20:46 and nothing and to leave
00:20:49 nothing is okay
00:20:52 where I am going now
00:20:56 I can go this way I can continue
00:21:00 or I can go back for  here
00:21:03 I am not going to continue
00:21:05 here
00:21:09 I have no oil
00:21:13 an animal is
00:21:17 worth another door it is good
00:21:23 that there
00:21:24 is the big corridor
00:21:27 it is not the big corridor it is a corridor
00:21:29 but it is a straight corridor this
00:21:34 statue moves when I do not look at it
00:21:38 so you have to always look at
00:21:41 it
00:21:48 Wait,
00:21:51 I can,
00:21:53 there's oil there, well, I'm going to pass,
00:21:55 I have a lot of oil,
00:21:57 I always have to look at it, I hope there's
00:21:59 one, if there are two, I can't look at the always
00:22:04 to see
00:22:07 that there's a pick
00:22:14 statue,
00:22:16 look, I can hear more
00:22:19 things here, there are some basses
00:22:26 and he has opened the door without looking at god
00:22:31 or there is
00:22:34 no wind that opens the door
00:22:36 once only once
00:22:41 the statue is not really going to come to see
00:22:44 what I have here
00:22:49 I am going to go down this corridor first
00:22:51 the statue still scares me  I think that
00:22:53 behind the door the bad will no longer follow me,
00:22:59 well, I more or less know the
00:23:01 monsters that there is how to make them not kill me
00:23:06 and here the lady
00:23:15 I think that is not like the lady but
00:23:17 it works the same as if it were not  I look if I
00:23:21 don't I don't look at it no nothing happens
00:23:25 ok
00:23:28 and here is another big corridor you can go
00:23:32 straight first straight here
00:23:34 [Music]
00:23:39 bad
00:23:42 and I hear something but like it's here
00:23:44 behind the wall but there's nothing
00:23:51 good here
00:23:54 nothing here  There could be the big monster
00:23:59 I hope not
00:24:02 if I don't get in here
00:24:05 another statue
00:24:07 to the statues
00:24:11 first oil
00:24:14 then I'm going to look at the map I'm going to go to
00:24:17 the right

00:24:23 I no longer like to hear something
00:24:26 that is heard over there over there or me

00:26:18 end and it's
00:26:22 already here
00:26:25 I'm going to get into the small corridors

00:24:36 I don't have doors here. I have to put doors,
00:24:39 maybe not.  I even have doors
00:24:44 if there are no doors it makes sense so

00:25:19 solve the problems I have
00:25:22 that they don't understand the rooms and they get
00:25:25 upset and want to hesitate.

00:00:13 Adrià, here to talk
00:00:17 about a topic that is exciting and super
00:00:21 interesting, but it is a bit disgusting, it makes
00:00:26 us a bit disgusting
00:00:29 cs because  Today we are going to talk about what
00:00:32 we are going to talk about we are going to talk about the
00:00:33 rights of said if you are from
00:00:37 ants of spiders of all these
00:00:40 bugs said insects and other animals
00:00:44 that are in the house of course in the house not
00:00:49 in the house sometimes we see  seen we see
00:00:53 small animals that
00:00:56 are not pets they are not our
00:01:00 animals in general it is a cat or a
00:01:04 dog of ours no no they are not bugs that
00:01:07 are around the house a partner
00:01:10 is looking for food like the bug and
00:01:14 I have seen more than at night  home if it's the
00:01:17 ants in your house there are many ants
00:01:20 the ants in my house also in your
00:01:22 house too yes no ants ants
00:01:27 here yes in this house I have seen and stormy
00:01:30 gas
00:01:30 oh yes and they are in the sink
00:01:34 yes I don't know I don't know well I arrived no  there is water
00:01:37 I suppose  they also need water but
00:01:40 in the sink there the toilet yes and there what
00:01:45 is this
00:01:47 in the sink wall and that's where you
00:01:51 wash your hands it aggravates your hands and in the
00:01:54 sink there are ants ants yes I don't know I don't
00:01:59 know why there is no game food  if there is
00:02:02 water here there is water they
00:02:06 don't need water maybe their mouths are
00:02:09 dry their mouths
00:02:11 have hair what do you think
00:02:17 ants like that they like hair
00:02:23 but in my house in my previous house
00:02:27 yes there was in the kitchen in alhendín  There were a
00:02:29 lot of ants, normal, because there was
00:02:31 food. Yes, of course,
00:02:34 in my house there are also some ants
00:02:37 because they are in the garden, but it wasn't for me,
00:02:40 if it were outside, sometimes they come in a
00:02:43 bit, but the ants don't bother me.
00:02:46 There is grass, it wasn't exactly a garden,
00:02:49 but  ants don't disgust you they are
00:02:53 interesting if you can look at them for a while
00:02:56 but you have to get them out following a
00:02:58 path there is a path and they all
00:03:02 follow the same path
00:03:04 yes yes it is very interesting and interesting and
00:03:06 I like it if you put your finger  on the way
00:03:08 then they lose their feet they
00:03:11 start looking for it leads to the side of the
00:03:12 road they start looking for the path
00:03:14 tears until they find it and
00:03:17 then again they follow the path yes yes yes they
00:03:19 are very smart aha
00:03:22 I know very well what other bugs and other
00:03:24 bugs you have  In your house in my house
00:03:27 now if I got married there are a lot of
00:03:29 spiders there are spiders and in some of the
00:03:32 spider ones it's very easy a spider doesn't have six
00:03:36 legs like ants not a spider from
00:03:38 anyone 3 to 8 you have 88 legs and a
00:03:43 lot of eyes
00:03:46 how many eyes 8 868
00:03:53 there are spiders because there are also mosquitoes
00:03:57 and things like that and the spiders
00:03:59 eat the mosquitoes the mosquitoes
00:04:01 eat the ants new I don't think
00:04:05 the spiders are also very interesting
00:04:08 yes they are very interesting to see if they
00:04:12 build the spider exactly when they
00:04:15 build  a cobweb and I think that
00:04:17 first they make one like this according to one like this
00:04:21 one like this and then they fill it up
00:04:25 because in my house the spiders that
00:04:28 are there are very big of course so why
00:04:31 if they are if they are big and scary  I
00:04:35 mean they are tiny no I
00:04:38 like them too I like tiny spiders
00:04:40 when I see them I don't kill the new ones I don't kill them
00:04:47 but here in this house I haven't seen
00:04:51 spiders yet but I haven't seen
00:04:56 mosquitoes either they were mosquitoes it's another
00:04:59 insect
00:05:02 mosquitoes  mosquitoes bite
00:05:06 you they suck your blood mosquitoes suck blood
00:05:13 yes yes exactly and spiders like to
00:05:16 eat mosquitoes of course
00:05:19 it's winter here in spain and in
00:05:23 winter there aren't many mosquitoes and that's not
00:05:26 why spiders aren't here now no  there are a
00:05:31 lot of them the spiders don't have food maybe
00:05:35 the spiders are sleeping I have no idea
00:05:43 the biologists are very good and in your house you've
00:05:51 seen other animals and others I
00:05:54 haven't seen here I haven't seen any other
00:05:57 animals no other bugs but I have seen them

00:06:08 goes a lot Basque once he can no longer
00:06:11 walk yes because he is missing his back leg
00:06:14 he can't walk anymore because he
00:06:16 lacks it because he doesn't have a
00:06:20 back leg and  I am addicted to cockroaches

00:08:32 here if the
00:08:35 parks sometimes it's a rat if at night more if
00:08:39 I during the day I think that  I have not
00:08:41 seen it at night they come out they come out more when I
00:08:44 was in Thailand also at night
00:08:46 you could see many many rats and big ones and they
00:08:49 ran of course you
00:08:52 have ever eaten rats a day it is not good for
00:08:55 us rare no no no no where you
00:08:58 catch rare there are places  in
00:09:01 asia where rats are eaten and if
00:09:03 you have never seen it I am not going to talk about a bug
00:09:08 said that especially not now now in
00:09:12 summer when summer comes
00:09:14 now it is winter but then
00:09:18 spring and summer will come and in summer there is a
00:09:23 bug
00:09:24 what  and enter the house enter the house
00:09:28 many many bugs that fly
00:09:31 and pass into your hand on your head on
00:09:35 your shoulder everywhere very heavy
00:09:37 they bother them if they are very people because they
00:09:40 went from tv3 rector and they are bugs that it is
00:09:45 very difficult to kill them  It was difficult to create or
00:09:49 get rid of the six that they have. We are
00:09:51 talking about the flies. The flies were
00:09:54 projected. The marks have huge eyes,
00:09:59 not a fly, of course, but it has huge eyes
00:10:03 and it sees.
00:10:11 they escape very fast very fast
00:10:13 yes yes that is why it is true that they are very
00:10:17 heavy especially here in spain
00:10:20 especially in october in october no i didn't
00:10:23 know there are no flies
00:10:27 a different type of machines that are
00:10:30 very heavy
00:10:32 only one more type of thing occurs to me  Getting to the
00:10:36 saying that there are more moths in your house of
00:10:37 course moths I have also seen
00:10:41 here in this house this house where I am
00:10:43 now I have also seen moths have you
00:10:46 seen I don't know if moths are a type
00:10:48 of butterfly no  so similar no 6 match
00:10:52 similar to butterflies similar to
00:10:57 butterflies but they are nocturnal true they
00:11:01 fly at night during during the
00:11:05 night it is during the day no no you can't
00:11:08 see moths but during the night they
00:11:10 fly and go looking for the light the light they
00:11:14 love the  light the light that and social
00:11:18 and entering the house moths also enter your house
00:11:20 in summer in summer
00:11:23 especially in summer in summer it would be
00:11:27 moths but normally there are many they
00:11:31 do not eat your clothes which is that I think
00:11:34 it is not true it is not  True, it is
00:11:36 easier for moths to last as long as they
00:11:38 eat and that's it, I can't think of
00:11:42 any other type of bug insect
00:11:44 that will be in La Gomera, which is
00:11:48 not true, I think that's it, we've already
00:11:51 talked about
00:11:52 everything else, finish  here he already knows
00:11:54 everything you need to know about the
00:11:57 css

00:02:00 one that does not work
00:02:04 and in the machine buy the ticket and the
00:02:08 ticket
00:02:10 the ticket is a paper ticket it
00:02:13 is a bill  ete paper yes yes yes yes
00:02:17 because in spain there is no money

00:02:30 they are paper
00:02:32 and there are bills and there are bills that you have

00:03:33 have a ticket and when you pass they
00:03:38 pass behind you very quickly yes
00:03:42 Yes, for example, I pass by
00:03:45 and a person comes from

00:02:11 good and the bell and the bell here is  or
00:02:17 is it a bell the bell when
00:02:20 electricity passes makes noise it is heard no
00:02:25 so we connect magnesium to see
00:02:30 a piece a piece of magnesium and a piece of
00:02:36 copper
00:02:38 very well then the magnesium goes with the
00:02:43 black wire here okay and the copper goes with
00:02:49 the red red very  well then here it
00:02:54 is easy the red with the red red with
00:02:59 red and black with black black with black
00:03:05 ok and so the lemon for this is the
00:03:09 lemon because we are making a pile
00:03:11 we are not making a pile
00:03:16 but a pile a pile of lemon so
00:03:22 I go  Let's cut the lemon here a piece
00:03:28 very well so if it's not ready, put it
00:03:33 well I have to prick the lemon
00:03:37 and try it in different places in
00:03:41 different places to see well I'll try
00:03:45 here okay let's
00:03:48 see let's see it will work or not
00:03:51 here  no
00:03:53 here yes yes there is juice here there is liquid there is
00:03:57 lemon juice let's see you hear it I'm going to put
00:04:00 it closer so you can say it yes yes you
00:04:04 can hear it
00:04:12 now yes
00:04:15 you have to play it you have to play it in the
00:04:18 background
00:04:26 yes yes yes it sounds very good then  In fact,
00:04:30 the magnesium is being lost now
00:04:35 we have used it very little but the
00:04:39 magnesium is separating it is breaking down it is not
00:04:44 losing it so it is used it is used part
00:04:47 of the magnesium that becomes ions
00:04:50 it all becomes unions not
00:04:53 charged positive charge ions  of magnesium and
00:04:57 electricity is passed through
00:05:01 electricity passes energy through the
00:05:03 doorbell very well what else and the next one
00:05:09 is danielle's cell danielle's cell
00:05:12 says it is one of the first
00:05:16 cells one of the first
00:05:20 batteries invented in the world  there
00:05:24 is no lemon, that's it, so how do we do it, we
00:05:28 have to prepare a bottle here, a
00:05:34 vial, have here two two bottles, not one with,
00:05:40 I don't know what it is sulphide, sulphate,
00:05:44 sulphate or copper sulphate, and it doesn't say so, I
00:05:48 'm not a scientist, sulphate
00:05:52 sulphate  copper and this is not zinc
00:05:57 zinc sulfate copper sulfate and
00:05:59 zinc sulfate very well then 5 milliliters here
00:06:06 we have the line of 5 5 milliliters here well
00:06:12 come 5 milliliters this for
00:06:17 safety  ad
00:06:19 the chemical does not come out we do not have to
00:06:23 open it here with a clip with a clip you have
00:06:28 to click click here well push
00:06:32 you have to push a cotton ball there is not like
00:06:35 a cotton ball like a cotton ball inside and here
00:06:41 55 milliliters
00:06:44 very well 5 milliliters of
00:06:47 copper sulfate  and now zinc sulphate let's see I'm going
00:06:53 to close it here just in case and
00:06:57 here I still have to push very well
00:07:02 also 5 milliliters
00:07:06 here 55 milliliters
00:07:10 very well I close it so I need
00:07:15 cloth of the cloth and the cloth there are gloves
00:07:19 here
00:07:21 you hold up
00:07:25 very well better with  gloves for more
00:07:29 safety
00:07:31 then the fabrics where they are here here
00:07:34 here here there are pieces strips strips of fabric
00:07:39 fabric like the shirt is not fabric
00:07:42 so
00:07:44 we put both in both jars very
00:07:49 well and now we have to wet it with
00:07:52 copper sulfate we have to put more  five drops
00:07:57 five drops of copper sulfate 1 2 3 4
00:08:06 5 6 one more just in case well I think
00:08:11 it's all right now
00:08:13 okay then zinc and copper I need
00:08:18 copper again and this time zinc
00:08:22 very good copper  1
00:08:28 and this time it's not magnesium it's zinc
00:08:33 very good so more cables here there are
00:08:38 more cables then black to zinc is
00:08:43 ok and red to copper it
00:08:47 's hard to open this the pliers is ok
00:08:51 then copper copper to blue yes
00:08:56 yes ok I don't know no  it overturns it doesn't fall and
00:09:01 the black to the zinc not to the black ah yes
00:09:05 zinc and zinc sulfate and
00:09:07 copper and copper sulfate no yes yes yes zinc with
00:09:13 zinc sulfate and copper with copper with
00:09:17 copper sulfate ok then the doorbell
00:09:20 yes it will  you can use to see the doorbell
00:09:24 to see the doorbell yes no
00:09:29 if the doorbell can be heard but we have
00:09:34 a led lamp a bulb not a
00:09:37 led bulb here a led and for the led
00:09:42 the led says no the led goes black
00:09:46 here black here
00:09:49 and the red here and now if it doesn't light up
00:09:54 the leds need voltage they need a
00:09:59 voltage not a minimum voltage if they don't go above
00:10:04 the minimum voltage they can't be seen they don't
00:10:07 light up so how do we do it we
00:10:12 need more we
00:10:14 need to see
00:10:19 let's see let's see let's do it right  this is already good to
00:10:23 have zinc and zinc very well  ok I'll
00:10:27 put it the same as in the easier drawing
00:10:31 ok then more jars two
00:10:37 more jars very well and again copper sulphate
00:10:43 55 milliliters
00:10:45 very good that's it it's over there
00:10:48 is no more copper sulphate is not very good
00:10:53 that's it and zinc sulphate there
00:10:57 is a little to go there is a little there is more there is
00:11:02 more zinc sulphate there there are more chemicals
00:11:06 there are more cans here
00:11:10 in fact there are a lot but well I
00:11:13 think that it will be fine
00:11:17 then what else another cloth again  a
00:11:43 piece of cloth is fine and again copper sulphate very well then the red wire red wire with the copper here connects with the black wire let's see let's see now you have to open your mouth open ok okay and another piece of zinc
00:11:52 very well and another cable  black with the zinc
00:11:56 very well and now yes now the straight leg
00:12:01 with the red cable
00:12:04 here with the red cable very well and the leg
00:12:10 the crooked leg the bent leg with the
00:12:16 black cable let's see there it has come out oh
00:12:21 how scary
00:12:22 here if a light comes on  little you see it
00:12:26 I don't know if you see it but the led here  off and
00:12:31 on have turned it off
00:12:33 well I'm going to touch it if you can't see it you can see it very
00:12:37 very little
00:12:39 I'm going to show you how it is I'll show it to
00:12:42 see if with the phone here not have
00:12:47 turned it off
00:12:49 on if it doesn't turn on
00:12:53 yes
00:12:56 very well that's it we have a battery  a
00:13:01 chemical battery and of course these two cells
00:13:05 are in series one after the other and give
00:13:10 more voltage more we could put more more
00:13:15 and more cells to have a lot of
00:13:18 voltage so one of these is more
00:13:23 or less 11 volts and it is also 1.1
00:13:30 volts  and added, well, 2.2 volts, no,
00:13:36 which is more, 2.2 is more than 2 volts, 2
00:13:43 volts is the minimum for the led light,
00:13:46 for the led bulb, it needs more than 2
00:13:50 volts and that's why it lights up and that's it
00:13:55 these are the two  experiments
00:13:58 with electricity and if you don't know it
00:14:02 male chemistry is a
00:14:05 subscription service that you
00:14:09 will receive a kit you will receive one of these kits each month the
00:14:13 first month you will receive the starter
00:14:17 kit and then each month a kit each kit
00:14:22 has two or three two or three  experiments
00:14:27 and is in  many countries in many countries
00:14:31 of the world
00:14:33 I leave you below in the description of the
00:14:37 visit of the video a link a link to
00:14:41 mail chemistry if you want to receive these
00:14:44 experiments and you will also be
00:14:48 helping dreaming spanish ok and if you
00:14:53 liked it if you like this video write
00:14:57 comments below  and tell me if you want me
00:15:01 to do more experiments
