00:05:05 same
00:05:06 similar  but they are big,
00:05:09 nothing more big feet the aerial 45 which
00:05:12 are the ones in centimeters are 29
00:05:16 and a half centimeters are 45 give in Japan they
00:05:20 use interesting centimeters but in the
00:05:23 US I don't know I don't remember but well I
00:05:28 wore a smaller number smaller number
00:05:32 I understand that you don't  It's true like this, if
00:05:34 my feet are a little bigger
00:05:38 than Carlos's than from Pablo's, but it
00:05:41 's normal, not because Adrián is taller, of
00:05:43 course, then his feet
00:05:45 are also bigger and I saw very
00:05:48 well
00:05:48 and something else that we can without being fat,
00:05:51 I also have  one thing longer than you than you
00:05:54 than one thing longer one thing
00:05:56 longer than the light-haired right very
00:05:59 well without hair
00:06:01 my hair measures 3 millimeters 3 millimeters
00:06:06 I don't know but more than 3000 meters
00:06:09 measures more than 3 millimeters  It's
00:06:11 very good, well, now we are going to play a
00:06:15 game, okay, new, but a game with a
00:06:19 winner and a winner and a loser, or very
00:06:22 well, I will continue to win, you, you will be the
00:06:25 winner, or how confident you are,
00:06:31 but it is a game in which you will see
00:06:33 points.  ok ok
00:06:37 so we start with zero points with 0
00:06:40 0 points I'm going to clean this up fine
00:06:43 [Music]
00:06:47 so let's have it
00:06:52 here it will be up to date
00:06:56 and these are Adrià's points and this
00:06:59 is Pablo this is me and here will be my
00:07:01 points
00:07:03 and every time every  Once we win a point, we'll
00:07:06 score a point 2 3 4 5 I
00:07:11 'll stay very well, that's understood, so it
00:07:14 's a game in which you have to
00:07:17 guess what to guess if you decide to say
00:07:21 something and it's worth it if I don't know how to
00:07:24 explain guessing, it's not easy  but
00:07:27 we are going to play with cards with these
00:07:30 cards okay okay and you have to guess
00:07:33 you have to guess that if the next
00:07:38 card
00:07:39 is bigger or smaller I will do very
00:07:42 well than the previous one for fantastic
00:07:46 so I start with a card
00:07:49 a 6 very well worth in  so what do you think
00:07:52 the next one I want bigger or
00:07:55 smaller I think the next card is
00:07:57 going to be bigger bigger by the
00:08:00 way there are cards among him those
00:08:04 that will be a 1 is worth from the 10 to the
00:08:09 10 the  the highest yes yes yes yes so
00:08:11 if you want if I have removed let me think about it it
00:08:18 will arrive before larger
00:08:21 and smaller numbers
00:08:22 so I think the next one since it
00:08:24 will be smaller more than there will be
00:08:27 smaller yes or no no  It's bigger and it
00:08:34 doesn't get a point but your site is
00:08:39 fantastic so we're going to make one
00:08:43 two three four blocks smaller
00:08:46 then once after me once but
00:08:52 smaller and now it's very easy or not the
00:09:00 same but I'll say smaller
00:09:02 smaller than  plow if I'm right at
00:09:06 last or a single adult
00:09:07 because the 5 is smaller than the 10 the 10 was
00:09:12 changed it is not smaller than the 7 no
00:09:15 that I have not won more no windows that's why
00:09:18 now it is the first point
00:09:22 and the last the last letter  to one
00:09:26 more letter and to be bigger and bigger I will say  ía that is
00:09:30 going to be smaller than the smallest it
00:09:32 always goes because bigger ones
00:09:34 have already come out at 6 7 10 am there are many and
00:09:37 now there is less probability it will do very
00:09:39 well let's
00:09:41 see let's see if very good two points
00:09:45 three  points two points is bad it is a
00:09:48 good monthly and we are going one hundred and fifty
00:09:50 fifty very well and now I am going to play
00:09:53 well take the net
00:09:58 very well the times that a little I don't know
00:10:00 perfect
00:10:03 is shuffling I'm shuffling the jacks
00:10:06 those to do very well but well already  there is
00:10:12 one that is one of the is the city
00:10:16 is 1 and therefore we continue easy the
00:10:18 next one will be higher a 9
00:10:23 what a good next it will be higher
00:10:25 indeed the 9 is bigger is
00:10:28 higher is bigger than  yes well one
00:10:31 bigger than bigger than one whose
00:10:34 next shape I think will be
00:10:37 small is very because it is very big it
00:10:40 is already very big intelligent Carlos at
00:10:46 10 oysters
00:10:49 I have lost here we go but what values
00:10:52 point for table you don't have to believe  what
00:10:55 will be the next letter  do you think the
00:10:56 next card will be smaller or
00:10:59 bigger or bigger
00:11:05 well pablo and the next card will be
00:11:09 smaller more traps
00:11:14 [Music]
00:11:15 when he has seriously freed another point
00:11:18 from them 65 to shine it was difficult
00:11:24 but for me very well it is necessary that from
00:11:27 the  The next decade the next one
00:11:29 is also easy
00:11:32 I think it will be bigger very well
00:11:34 if it touches a one it will be smaller and
00:11:38 you with 345 will be bigger let's see what
00:11:40 happens
00:11:42 9
00:11:43 [Applause]
00:11:45 13 minutes okay but the game hasn't been over
00:11:50 nothing is done better there is a
00:11:52 second part
00:11:54 in which we are not going to use cards we
00:11:58 are not going to play with cards because today
00:12:01 we have brought something interesting straight
00:12:04 look adrià is the most expensive up
00:12:09 to date he has brought this scale we put it
00:12:11 so it will be seen  the number
00:12:14 and it's a scale that you put things here and
00:12:20 it tells you the weight
00:12:22 like all the 6 grams and I suppose he
00:12:25 knew that it will be seen but hey 16 very good
00:12:28 19 grams perfect
00:12:30 so we are going to play a game in
00:12:33 which we are going to ask ourselves, are we going to
00:12:36 p  ask ourselves if things weigh more or
00:12:41 less than well a certain number is not
00:12:46 perfect so you start if you want
00:12:48 for my good or not look I start
00:12:50 because you have fewer points to legal
00:12:53 so I give you the opportunity to win a
00:12:55 point okay burn then we start  with
00:13:00 this this is a wallet of a wallet
00:13:04 a wallet with money with money
00:13:09 and this wallet Adrià has to say if it
00:13:14 weighs if it weighs more or less than
00:13:21 150 grams 250 grams very well the
00:13:25 wallet dear to more videos
00:13:28 you can't can't catch the waves alone
00:13:31 looking
00:13:32 I think that piece more more than I think they
00:13:36 weigh more than 150 grams more than 150 now let's
00:13:40 see what happens
00:13:44 80-81 it has not weighed 81 grams it
00:13:51 is very light what do you think it is very light
00:13:53 for a portfolio my portfolio weighs a lot
00:13:55 Plus, his 28-year-old wallet
00:14:04 doesn't carry to a point, it's not from now,
00:14:15 I thought
00:14:17 [Music]
00:14:18 but well, now he has them, they are the
00:14:20 keys to show, these are thousands, the
00:14:23 keys to Adrián's house, he
00:14:33 brought it all forward, it's my gift that
00:14:35 a friend gave me  okay  Well, I'm going to tell you if it
00:14:39 weighs more or less
00:14:42 than 130 grams. 130
00:14:46 describes the 130 grams, which is more or
00:14:49 less 130 grams.
00:14:51 I think it weighs less than me.
00:15:03 54 to 94 thanks to a point to point for
00:15:11 me very well
00:15:15 well also to the next one like this
00:15:21 then the next thing is that it is not worth
00:15:26 it to drink with the milk and it
00:15:29 mixes and it is due the cola cao has
00:15:32 chocolate
00:15:34 so I am not going to leave you
00:15:39 but
00:15:41 I am going to say it is full to this look to
00:15:45 the brim  15 was more or less around
00:15:48 here okay okay so you have to
00:15:51 guess if it weighs more or less than 300
00:15:56 grams of salt more than 300 grams of more
00:15:59 sure according to those of 3 100 sure they
00:16:01 weigh more than 300 gold let's see let's see let's
00:16:03 see
00:16:06 it is 417 2 417 we are going to more than three
00:16:15 programs very well very well let's
00:16:19 see
00:16:21 I don't really know what to give you here
00:16:25 we could try it
00:16:27 is complicated this is very complicated
00:16:32 this is for pepper I don't know what
00:16:36 this is called
00:16:38 a mill a pepper
00:16:41 mill mill  pepper pepper
00:16:43 pepper is not is not  Just the one that we all
00:16:47 look at a little here, so to
00:16:50 be exact, it's like a line of
00:16:53 pepper and I would say that it weighs,
00:16:56 but I'm going to ask you, think
00:16:59 about 210 grams. 210 simple describes
00:17:06 the 200 or winds and 10 grams, well I
00:17:10 think they clearly weigh.  less less than
00:17:13 210 grams
00:17:15 serious and serious ladies let's see let's talk let's see
00:17:20 69
00:17:22 I'm very bad 69
00:17:29 less than 165 Galicians 55 points
00:17:40 very envied I know this and the next one the
00:17:43 next one is a bit difficult
00:17:47 because it's a plastic
00:17:50 bag a plastic bag that  It is very, very
00:17:53 light and I hope this scale is
00:17:58 precise enough,
00:18:01 that is, if it weighs more or less than 5 grams,
00:18:07 I would say that it weighs less - - - of miner
00:18:12 in exchange for 5 grams
00:18:21 99 grams 9 grams weighs more and more than 5 and
00:18:26 wine  to get no I have not guessed
00:18:28 I'm going to stay like this with 3 points
00:18:32 why not because you're not here now the
00:18:34 coin I think the coin is also
00:18:36 difficult a good
00:18:43 a coin a one euro coin I
00:18:48 wonder if it weighs more or less
00:18:53 than how much
00:18:55 10 grams 10 grams  We are 10 grams 3 grains
00:18:59 I wonder, is it worth more or less 10 grams
00:19:03 10 grams so the question is a
00:19:05 bit heavy more or less than the bag
00:19:10 [Music] it
00:19:11 was very similar to the days I think
00:19:16 the coin weighs more than 10 grams let's
00:19:21 see  let's see, it
00:19:22 doesn't weigh less, it weighs 77
00:19:27 7 grams, it
00:19:29 weighed less so I haven't got
00:19:31 a point
00:19:34 and it will
00:19:36 get big, what else I have something difficult this
00:19:40 is a little difficult for me a book
00:19:43 a very thick book very thick and I
00:19:48 'm going to tell you it weighs more or  less than 600
00:19:51 grams
00:19:53 600 grams I think it weighs a little more
00:19:56 than 600 grams it will do more
00:20:00 come on let's see them
00:20:03 and 794,700 men and four big ones at one
00:20:09 point one point or one point could finally
00:20:11 very well well well the book weighed more
00:20:14 than  600 grams well I've won a point
00:20:18 but I don't know what we can make
00:20:21 him guess I have
00:20:27 a plant here a plant here with a pot and this I
00:20:32 don't know how much it weighs I'm not going to tell you either
00:20:34 well we'll say directly more or less
00:20:39 d
00:20:42 more or  less than
00:20:45 950 grams 950 grams m  It's more or less
00:20:51 okay I think it's starting
00:20:57 but I'm going to say more
00:21:04 I'm not sure
00:21:08 I hope you see
00:21:14 this weight 900 I don't know if you see it
00:21:19 980 in the 580 to 980 grams to 980 grams
00:21:29 and here I think the time is over
00:21:32 game
00:21:34 [Laughs]
00:21:36 and Adrian I recorded clearly with four
00:21:41 fingers so less points is better four
00:21:44 points would have won a son with six
00:21:48 points
00:21:49 I lost yes he is more handsome
00:22:02 more
00:22:04 handsome it is true well well thanks for

00:03:38 for the mobile a charger is needed of
00:03:41 course because if not the battery the
00:03:44 battery runs out of course I understand  or this
00:03:47 after the passport is the most
00:03:49 important thing yes I agree it is very
00:03:51 important to say you can't forget the
00:03:53 fantastic charger is worth very well a
00:03:56 pin from a charger refused a
00:04:00 toiletry bag the toiletry bag of course the toiletry bag is
00:04:04 is a bag is a bag a  bag

00:04:23 the hair very well had adrián you use
00:04:26 shampoos sons
00:04:34 and when I talk with my friends and if I
00:04:38 they always ask me if you
00:04:41 use
00:04:46 this is toothpaste and this
00:04:49 nonsense teeth to use with a
00:04:51 toothbrush of course to

00:05:19 the ears and doing and do  s
00:05:22 ear plugs because so on the plane the
00:05:26 plane
00:05:28 makes a lot of noise a stop and I can sleep
00:05:31 to sleep better very well if you have a
00:05:34 child or not here next to

00:06:25 a little strange
00:06:30 later I come cocoa cocoa for lips
00:06:35 but for the lips it gets like this here it
00:06:38 turns and it gets
00:06:48 because in thailand in thailand
00:06:53 It's very hot and you sweat a lot.
00:06:55 Lipstick isn't necessary, of course,
00:06:57 because there's already a lot of humidity and a lot of
00:07:00 humidity, but on the plane, General Jon, if
00:07:05 there's air conditioning, it's cold. It's
00:07:08 very dry and the range of lips is going very

00:08:18 dry
00:08:22 how do you take care of yourself you take good care of yourself and I
00:08:26 like soft hands

00:02:16 mountain not the peak the peak of a
00:02:20 mountain but what mountain is this where
00:02:24 is this mountain
00:02:27 come on for the next piece it's even
00:02:32 easier it's going to make it very easy come on 1
00:02:35 2 3
00:02:39 now it's easy it's not easy enough

00:03:01 to show you the whole photo, okay, come on and this
00:03:06 is Machu Picchu, not Machu Picchu or Machu
00:03:10 Picchu, which is in Peru, which is in South
00:03:14 America, South America.  In Peru and if it is a
00:03:18 very well-known site, very famous
00:03:21 to visit in Peru, the Inca ruins
00:03:25 of the Inca empire or well, the
00:03:28 Inca civilization and if let's see, see, you have been right
00:03:32 in number 3, 4 or 5  From
00:03:37 Cinde, let's go to the next one, the
00:03:39 next photo
00:03:41 and of course, no, it's not the
00:03:46 sky, well, you can see a lot of sky, but that
00:03:49 's the sky, it's not, it's not easy. I'll show you
00:03:53 the next piece, which is this, this
00:03:56 is a brown brown color  but light
00:04:00 brown almost white it's not that that's
00:04:03 sand it looks sand but well it's still
00:04:07 difficult here well you can see a bit of
00:04:11 sky you can see some trees but
00:04:14 I still think it's difficult well I don't know if you're
00:04:18 very smart maybe I already know the country where
00:04:21 where is it but the next part of the
00:04:25 photo already well it is a more important clue
00:04:30 what is this this is more interesting you
00:04:34 can see some lines some horizontal stripes
00:04:38 where is this you know it you know that
00:04:43 it is what the photo is from the next the next
00:04:46 piece already  It's a good thing, it's clearer what
00:04:49 it is, what this is, where is
00:05:07 this?  is in the ruins  as of
00:05:09 chichén itzá chicherit or chichén itzá in
00:05:13 mexico it is in mexico it is
00:05:17 in mexico but it is in the yucatan around
00:05:21 here it is in yucatan in the ruins of
00:05:23 chichén itzá it is a mayan pyramid some
00:05:27 mayan ruins and it is also a well-
00:05:29 known site very visited by  tourists
00:05:32 tell me to write a comment saying
00:05:35 yes if you got it right if you knew it or
00:05:39 not let's go to the next photo and well
00:05:42 this grass this grass is very clear or
00:05:45 not this grass I know it like the back
00:05:49 of my hand it's very clear you don't
00:05:52 know seriously  what are we going to do with
00:05:55 you no it's not impossible it's not
00:05:58 clear with this grass well it's still
00:06:00 very difficult
00:06:03 sky well it doesn't help much let's
00:06:06 see let's see the next piece
00:06:10 this is more interesting they don't look like
00:06:13 stones it looks like a wall a wall
00:06:16 made of stone  with stone but it's still
00:06:19 hard it's a little hard let's see
00:06:22 next
00:06:25 what's up here what is this these rarer
00:06:27 no this is not so common what is this is
00:06:31 also brown d  and brown color
00:06:34 but I do not know if it is very clear that it
00:06:38 is that but hey this is the
00:06:40 interesting point yes here you already know it
00:06:44 well good job if you do not have to see the
00:06:47 next piece that is already a
00:06:49 clearer clue much clearer
00:06:53 yes  I don't think that now most
00:06:56 people know they know where this is. If you do
00:07:00 n't know, well, I'm going to show you the
00:07:03 whole photo where this is. This is
00:07:07 Easter Island, not Easter Island, in
00:07:10 the local language it's Rapa Nui.  Good thing they
00:07:14 made a movie and such and this island
00:07:17 is in the Pacific it is in the Pacific Ocean it
00:07:22 is now well it is part of chile it
00:07:25 is within the country of chile and you can
00:07:29 travel to the island from chile and yes
00:07:33 well tell me if you knew tell me
00:07:37 if you guessed it if you guessed it
00:07:40 is this photo we have
00:07:43 two left two photos left
00:07:48 I'm sorry but it's very funny yes
00:07:50 well this sky doesn't help much but the
00:07:53 next one doesn't help much either because it's
00:07:57 more sky and the next one is more sky
00:08:01 what  weird no because because I'm giving you
00:08:04 so much sky I don't know the smartest here
00:08:09 at number 3 maybe you're starting to intuit something
00:08:14 maybe you have some idea of ​​what it could
00:08:17 be but hey let's continue what is
00:08:21 this
00:08:22 this is more sky but there is a mountain
00:08:24 not one  mountain a small mountain or
00:08:30 maybe a mountain that is far away that
00:08:33 is very far
00:08:35 ok but it is still difficult to
00:08:38 see to see the next one the next
00:08:41 piece is already a very
00:08:43 important clue very clear come on
00:08:47 123 ok there is a car upside down and a
00:08:53 person  upside down because what is this
00:08:57 good I think it's starting to be easy
00:09:00 especially if you know it's not known if you
00:09:03 know this site if you've seen
00:09:06 photos of this site before well it's a
00:09:09 bit clear it's starting to be quite
00:09:12 clear I'm going to show you all  the photo is
00:09:15 not here you have
00:09:18 the salar de uyuni the salar de uyuni in
00:09:22 bolivia is to be seen here in here in
00:09:26 bolivia and it is also a good place
00:09:30 quite visited by tourists and what
00:09:32 is it this is a salt flat it is
00:09:37 a plain like u  n salt field all
00:09:41 covered by salt very flat so
00:09:44 when it rains when it rains it is covered with
00:09:46 water it is all covered by a
00:09:49 thin layer of water and it becomes a mirror it
00:09:53 looks like a mirror like the
00:09:56 mirror you look at in the bathroom  No,
00:09:59 you can take some very nice photos
00:10:02 here in the Salar de Uyuni when it's not
00:10:06 raining because it looks like this you
00:10:09 can see the salt and it's still like that very,
00:10:12 very flat, you were right or wrong in
00:10:16 which number you got it right Let's see Let's
00:10:20 see  the next one the next one is the
00:10:22 last photo and here we see plants we can see
00:10:26 some plants some plants that are
00:10:30 more dark green in color or not rather
00:10:33 dark they are not very large plants
00:10:37 this is a clue it starts to be a
00:10:39 clue if with this clue we  It is clear, well,
00:10:42 in the end, the eye will not be clear to you either,
00:10:46 but well, we are going to see the
00:10:48 next one, which is this.
00:10:51 This also seems to be earth, it is not
00:10:55 brown in color, but well, it is still
00:10:58 difficult, it is a bit difficult, we are going to see
00:11:01 the next one, which is this.  o
00:11:04 well here we see more we
00:11:06 can see the road through which the
00:11:09 cars pass we see more plants similar to
00:11:13 the plants from before it looks a bit like
00:11:17 a hill like a hill also made of
00:11:20 dirt a hill where there are no
00:11:22 plants there are no trees it can  give a
00:11:25 clue as to where it might be from, where it might be,
00:11:29 do you know it or not yet
00:11:32 I won't show you the next one, the last
00:11:36 clue, well, it's a mountain, it doesn't look like a
00:11:40 photo of a mountain, here you can see the top, you
00:11:43 can see the highest point of  the mountain
00:11:46 but do you know what mountain it is do you know
00:11:50 where this mountain is or not I'm going to show you the
00:11:53 whole photo now
00:11:56 and if where is this this is really
00:11:59 this is in Spain yes and this is the
00:12:04 highest mountain in Spain this is
00:12:08 Teide then  It is in Spain but it
00:12:12 is not in the Iberian Peninsula, it is not in
00:12:16 Europe, it is in the Canary Islands, it is on one of
00:12:20 the islands in Africa, very close to the
00:12:24 African coast in the Atlantic, but
00:12:27 much further south of the
00:12:29 Iberian Peninsula than where most are.  of
00:12:32 Spain and Teide is  tá in tenerife
00:12:36 tenerife is one of the islands of the
00:12:38 canary islands and teide is a volcano it
00:12:42 is a mountain that is erupting and
00:12:45 with lava it has been growing and
00:12:47 the volcano has formed and this is a

00:03:46 person

00:04:26 blonde, she has brown hair, her
00:04:29 hair is not black, maybe brown,
00:04:33 and she changed her hair color, but now
00:04:39 for a long time, many years, she has
00:04:42 had blonde hair and many
00:04:46 people, many people know her for
00:04:49 having blonde hair, no.  well I hope

00:05:31 a bit of bangs on the
00:05:34 front hair,
00:05:37 I think it's still a bit difficult,
00:05:41 let's see, let's see the next one,
00:05:45 well, a little more  the jacket I don't know
00:05:49 if it's a jacket or if it doesn't look like a
00:05:52 jacket that opens it opens all the way
00:05:56 down
00:05:57 let's do the next one
00:06:00 well here you can see something else you can see the
00:06:04 chin the chin with a little
00:06:07 beard not with a  the hairs here the beard
00:06:11 that is beginning to grow
00:06:13 well it looks quite clear that it is a
00:06:17 boy it is a man and maybe some of
00:06:21 you already know who the next
00:06:25 clue is the next piece is already very
00:06:30 important it makes it easier let's
00:06:34 see  the next one,
00:06:37 your sheet, you can see this boy's eye is
00:06:40 an eye the color of what color it is it looks
00:06:44 like brown no but maybe light brown
00:06:49 I'm not I'm not sure I'm not

00:06:56 person but hey if not  You know
00:06:59 I'm sorry but I'm going to show the whole photo
00:07:04 and if it's Enrique Iglesias no

00:07:17 Colombian singer a singer from Colombia from
00:07:22 Colombia
00:07:25 and Enrique Iglesias is a singer from
00:07:28 Spain well from Spain  But I think a
00:07:34 lot of time has passed in other countries,
00:07:37 maybe in the US, but hey, Enrique
00:07:42 Iglesias is also a singer, a
00:07:45 very famous singer,
00:07:48 let's see the next person.
00:07:52 Well, that's easy, not very easy, who?  n
00:07:57 was it is I think I think I myself have
00:07:59 forgotten I have forgotten who
00:08:01 this person was no no I do not think so yes I
00:08:05 know who who is but well we see hair
00:08:09 we see hair brown
00:08:13 hair brown hair brown hair let's
00:08:17 see a little  more
00:08:20 we see more hair we see the hand the hand of
00:08:24 this person a thin hand with
00:08:28 thin fingers no they are not thick fingers
00:08:32 well it's a woman it's not a girl a
00:08:36 woman we see that it has 22 rings I
00:08:40 don't have where do I have my ring here it
00:08:43 has two rings two  rings and well she
00:08:49 's running her hand through her hair but it's
00:08:52 still not very easy we're not going to see
00:08:56 the next one
00:08:59 okay well if it's a woman it's a woman
00:09:04 we can't see the dress she's wearing she's wearing a
00:09:07 black dress and but it's still
00:09:12 a bit  difficult or not I don't know I don't know if
00:09:17 some of you already know who
00:09:22 this person is but if not it's okay
00:09:25 let's see better
00:09:27 this is an important clue we see
00:09:32 the lips the lips of this person and
00:09:37 maybe you already know who it is if not
00:09:42 well good v  Let's see the next one
00:09:46 , you can see one eye, this person has
00:09:49 dark eyes, I don't know brown, but
00:09:54 dark brown, brown bordering on black,
00:09:58 and I think many of you will know
00:10:03 who he is, why let's
00:10:06 see because you can already see enough of his
00:10:11 face  not from this woman's face
00:10:14 and if it's penélope cruz penélope cruz who
00:10:20 is an actress a spanish actress an
00:10:23 actress from spain who has acted in
00:10:27 quite a few movies in many
00:10:30 spanish movies but also quite a few
00:10:33 hollywood movies usa movies
00:10:38 yes good it was very  Obvious but I think it is
00:10:43 a good option for this game we are going to
00:10:48 see the fourth person this will already be the
00:10:53 fourth person and ok well it looks like
00:10:58 a suit jacket not a person
00:11:02 wearing a suit well we are going to see a little
00:11:05 more for now  It is difficult, yes, you already know
00:11:08 it, well, perfect and write it down and you
00:11:12 have already won. You have won this game.
00:11:16 Okay, you can see his ear, his ear can be seen, his
00:11:21 ear, we know who he is with the ear, it
00:11:25 's difficult, we're not going to see, let's see more of him.
00:11:30 The hair can already be seen, the hair also has
00:11:34 brown or not
00:11:36 brown hair, it has a bit of a blonde color here,
00:11:40 I don't know if it's from having changed the
00:11:44 color of the hair before, okay, but well, the
00:11:48 hair is mostly brown, let's
00:11:52 see a little more,
00:11:53 okay now  you can see the chin, let's see
00:11:57 again, this person's chin has a
00:12:01 bit of a beard, no, so if it's a boy, it
00:12:04 's a name and let's see, well, I don't know,
00:12:09 some of you may already know
00:12:14 who this person is, but
00:12:17 hey  With the next piece it will be
00:12:20 easier even easier
00:12:23 yes no yes I think now it's very
00:12:28 easy you can see the nose you can see the eye
00:12:32 also has a brown eye not
00:12:37 also brown easy no good I'm going to
00:12:40 show you all the photo
00:12:45 And yes, it is Ricky Martin, yes, Ricky Martin,
00:12:49 who is also a singer, not
00:12:52 a singer, a good singer, technically
00:12:56 American, because this Puerto Rican
00:13:00 from the island around here on the
00:13:04 island of Puerto Rico, who is from the United States, but
00:13:08 well, he is also a national.
00:13:11 spain  Ol also has a Spanish passport,
00:13:15 well, or Puerto Rico, it's a country and it's not
00:13:18 technically a country, but it's a place, a
00:13:22 Spanish-speaking place, not a
00:13:24 Spanish-speaking region, and yes, well, Ricky Martin,
00:13:28 if you see him now, if you see his photos from
00:13:32 now, he looks different,
00:13:35 quite different.  because he has and has a
00:13:39 beard all his beard is
00:13:42 white and well it's quite different
00:13:47 but if this is a photo a
00:13:51 slightly older photo and one is missing one more photo
00:13:55 let's see who it is
00:13:59 that we see here again the armpit me
00:14:04 they like the armpits
00:14:06 no no no no
00:14:09 but well well it's difficult it's not a
00:14:12 little difficult we're going to see a bit more
00:14:17 we also see the hair the hair what
00:14:21 color is this hair it looks like a brown
00:14:24 but light brown fairly light
00:14:27 brown no it's not a very brown  dark
00:14:32 and here we see well a little more of the hair
00:14:36 the upper part of the hair is a girl
00:14:39 it is not clear that it is a
00:14:42 girl her hair is dark brown but a
00:14:46 little dyed dyed a little more blond
00:14:49 more  It's blonde in color, it doesn't have bangs,
00:14:52 but the hair is good, you can change your
00:14:56 hair style and that's not very easy.
00:14:59 We're still going to see this nose a little better.
00:15:04 What do you think? What do you think
00:15:07 of this nose?
00:15:11 maybe some
00:15:17 of you already know who she is but it
00:15:22 's a bit difficult I'm still going to show you
00:15:25 the last part
00:15:31 that's not easier, especially the lips,
00:15:39 this girl has lips that are also quite characteristic and
00:15:43 well if you don't already know then I'm sorry
00:15:46 you have failed  I'm going to show you the
00:15:50 whole photo
00:15:53 if it's ana de armas look, I think I already
00:15:58 told you about ana de armas a bit in another
00:16:02 in another video and she's an actress she also
00:16:06 acts in several movies and series she has
00:16:10 acted in the elite series in the
00:16:13 elite Spanish series and it has also appeared
00:16:16 in quite a few US movies it
00:16:20 does not appear in the latest
00:16:25 blade runner movie it
00:16:27 appears in the movie the knife out
00:16:30 too and well I think it was an
00:16:35 interesting example  e ana de armas is cuban she
00:16:39 is from cuba from the island of cuba but she
00:16:44 grew up in spain she has lived in spain for many years
00:16:47 now i don't know i don't know if they
00:16:52 live in the usa or what
00:16:55 but she is originally from cuba and
00:16:58 well yes  now it is having a lot of success
00:17:03 and surely you are going to see it in more and more
00:17:07 movies and that's it this was the last
00:17:11 photo tell me how much it cost you in how
00:17:17 many points you got in which

00:00:22 today we are going to play a game watch this
00:00:28 video if you want to know which one weighs
00:00:32 more
00:00:35 [  Music]
00:00:38 hello well yes today we are going to play a game it
00:00:45 is a game of 10
00:00:49 10 questions yes then count count
00:00:55 how many you get right how many you
00:01:02 accept how many no you do not accept
00:01:09 and at the end at the end write write
00:01:13 down if you got it right I don't know 10 10 out of
00:01:20 10 or  maybe 0 out of 10 write it down in
00:01:27 a comment
00:01:29 then
00:01:33 the first question is worth it you
00:01:38 know which weighed more the eiffel tower
00:01:45 weighs more the eiffel tower in paris or weighs
00:01:50 more the statue
00:01:54 weighs more the eiffel tower or the statue
00:01:58 of liberty  from new york which one weighs
00:02:03 more because both of them are
00:02:07 french they are not from france one is in
00:02:12 paris the other was a gift a gift from
00:02:18 france and the usa
00:02:23 which one weighs more good well there is a
00:02:27 difference one  very big difference yes
00:02:31 because the eiffel tower weighs 10 thousand 100
00:02:39 tons
00:02:41 10 thousand 100 tons but the statue
00:02:46 of liberty only weighs 220 tons
00:02:52 if the statue of liberty is
00:02:57 smaller and weighs less it weighs less than
00:03:02 the eiffel tower and you have
00:03:06 correct or not you have not succeeded
00:03:10 write it pointing in I don't know on a
00:03:15 piece of paper worth number 2
00:03:19 that weighs more weighs more the statue the
00:03:24 statue of liberty
00:03:26 the statue of liberty or the
00:03:32 international space station the international space station
00:03:38 I don't think it's I don't know  more or less like this
00:03:42 which one weighs more
00:03:45 we already know we know that the statue of
00:03:49 liberty weighs 200 220 tons so
00:03:56 the international space station
00:04:01 is not in space it is
00:04:06 circling circling the earth it
00:04:10 weighs more or less than 220 tons
00:04:16 what do you think well
00:04:20 right now the
00:04:25 international space station weighs 450
00:04:31 tons if it weighs more it weighs more than the
00:04:37 statue of liberty is in
00:04:40 space yes yes the hem  I was sent into
00:04:44 space and it weighs more than the Statue
00:04:49 of Liberty of course the Statue of
00:04:53 Liberty would be it would be more fun if
00:04:58 the Statue of Liberty
00:05:02 went around the earth and it wasn't the
00:05:08 international space station but
00:05:11 well the international space station
00:05:14 it is better
00:05:17 for science and other very boring things
00:05:23 so you have been right or you have not been
00:05:26 right
00:05:29 write it down write it down number 3 the
00:05:35 international
00:05:39 space station the international space station or a
00:05:42 boeing
00:05:43 a boeing a boeing 747
00:05:47 which which one weighs more the station the
00:05:52 space station are  450 tons
00:05:58 and a 747 weighs more or less because
00:06:06 747s are different there are several but
00:06:11 the heaviest one weighs 400 48
00:06:18 tons yes yes yes the space station
00:06:24 is still heavier weighs more than a
00:06:30 747 but well it's almost the same, it's not  very very
00:06:34 similar very similar the weight of the
00:06:38 space station and a 747
00:06:45 that you have hit it or not you have not
00:06:48 hit it next number  o 4 What weighs more
00:06:53 a car a car a normal
00:06:58 car a family car or an elephant
00:07:04 an elephant an African elephant an African elephant
00:07:08 if which one weighs more do you know
00:07:14 a car an average family car weighs
00:07:20 1,600 kilos 1,600 kilos and an elephant an
00:07:28 elephant  An African elephant weighs more or less
00:07:32 than you think, well, an African elephant
00:07:36 can weigh
00:07:39 6,600 kilos 66 tons,
00:07:45 6,000 kilos, if an elephant
00:07:49 normally weighs, it weighs more, it weighs a lot
00:07:53 more than a car, it
00:07:56 's a bit surprising.
00:08:03 easy maybe it was
00:08:06 n't as difficult as the others number 5
00:08:12 number 5 an african elephant
00:08:15 again the african elephant that they are
00:08:20 we already know that they are six thousand six thousand kilos
00:08:24 or a blue whale a blue
00:08:30 whale the blue whale is the biggest whale in
00:08:34 the world  no which one weighs which one weighs more
00:08:39 well this I think it is not difficult
00:08:43 either the whales can start
00:08:49 between 50 50,000 and 150,000 kilos not between
00:08:59 50 and 150 tons they
00:09:04 weigh they weigh a lot they are big mu  and very
00:09:09 big
00:09:10 yes then clearly a blue
00:09:15 whale a whale a blue whale does not weigh
00:09:19 weighs more weighs more than an elephant
00:09:24 number 6 a mobile a mobile but not not a
00:09:30 normal mobile a mobile a mobile phone
00:09:34 the smallest phone
00:09:37 the smallest the phone most  small
00:09:42 the smallest in the world or a battery a
00:09:48 battery like this a double battery ano which one
00:09:53 weighs more good a battery a battery
00:09:58 like this a rechargeable battery it is not
00:10:03 alkaline it is rechargeable it weighs more or less
00:10:07 31
00:10:10 in black everything is all in black 31
00:10:15 grams  so what do you think you think
00:10:19 the mobile the smallest mobile in the world
00:10:23 weighs more or weighed less than 31 grams the
00:10:29 smallest mobile in the world weighs
00:10:34 42 42 grams if it weighs more than the battery
00:10:42 well I'll leave it here it
00:10:46 weighs more than the battery but no no  much
00:10:50 more than a battery so
00:10:54 you can imagine a mobile so small
00:10:59 that it doesn't weigh that either oysters yes yes
00:11:05 but hey the mobile weighs more than battery
00:11:10 number 7
00:11:14 7 this is also very interesting
00:11:20 that a ship weighs more than a ship but no
00:11:25 a normal ship the biggest ship the
00:11:29 heaviest the bank the heaviest ship in
00:11:34 the world
00:11:38 the ship or the empire state the
00:11:43 casino building more or less the

00:12:03 the ship the heaviest ship in the world
00:12:07 with it's
00:12:09 a million tons
00:12:14 so a million tons a million
00:12:19 tons imagine the empire state that you
00:12:23 think is more or less the empire state
00:12:28 the empire  state are 331
00:12:35 122 tons 331 thousand 122 tons the
00:12:45 ship is 3 empire state 3
00:12:51 don't see my god the ship weighs
00:12:56 much more much more than the empire state
00:12:59 yes
00:13:02 yes yes this is a surprise
00:13:06 by the way this ship is called that yes
00:13:11 this is the name of the boat if you
00:13:14 want to look it up on wikipedia no
00:13:17 pioneering spirit it's okay we have
00:13:22 33 more things left I'm going to clean up a
00:13:26 bit number 8
00:13:30 number 8 33 more number 8 left the
00:13:36 blue whale again the whale and the
00:13:41 ball  ena azul or the bell
00:13:46 the bell from youtube not the heaviest bell in
00:13:50 the world so let
00:13:58 's see the whale between 50 / 50 tons
00:14:05 and 150 tons
00:14:09 we are not going to host 150 the biggest whales
00:14:14 150 tons the bell the
00:14:20 biggest bell  come the largest bell
00:14:23 in the world that now now
00:14:28 you can still play a boom that works that
00:14:33 you can play weighs more or less than 150
00:14:38 tons think think about
00:14:42 the current heaviest bell
00:14:47 now year 2020
00:14:52 at least this year year 2020 the
00:14:55 heaviest bell is 116 tons yes
00:15:02 116 tons well it weighs less less than
00:15:07 the largest blue whale no
00:15:11 what happens than before in the past
00:15:15 there was a bell a bigger
00:15:21 bell a bell of 297 tons yes the
00:15:30 current bell the one now is in  china
00:15:33 but the previous one was in burma
00:15:38 burma myanmar what happens that this
00:15:43 bell now
00:15:45 it is not known where it is it is known that it is
00:15:50 in the water if it is in the water it is in the
00:15:56 bottom it
00:16:00 is
00:16:02 in the bottom  of a river there is a river there is a
00:16:07 river and a long time ago the bell
00:16:12 sank sank into the river
00:16:16 and now it is
00:16:21 somewhere somewhere at the bottom of the river but
00:16:26 no one doesn't know exactly where where it
00:16:30 is then well right now the
00:16:34 The biggest bell is 116 tons,
00:16:39 what is the number nine? Gold, gold, I
00:16:46 don't have, I don't have gold, but well, gold, not
00:16:50 like gold medals,
00:16:54 ingots, gold ingots, gold,
00:16:59 but all the gold, all the gold in the world,
00:17:05 all the  gold is not the gold that is in the
00:17:10 in the mountains in the earth underground
00:17:14 we do not know all the gold that is in
00:17:19 jewels on the earth that we have
00:17:23 not all the gold in the world or the
00:17:29 oil the oil inside a ship
00:17:34 in  a ship an oil tanker a ship
00:17:38 not at sea
00:17:40 a large oil tanker a large oil
00:17:44 tanker now there are more or less
00:17:50 250 thousand tons okay so what do
00:17:55 you think all the gold in the world is more it
00:18:01 weighs more or less than
00:18:06 oil only oil  I'm not
00:18:09 counting  or the weight the weight of the ship not
00:18:13 only the oil
00:18:18 the oil
00:18:20 the oil inside the ship there are 250,000
00:18:25 tons of a ship weighs more or less
00:18:30 than the gold you think because gold is
00:18:36 thought to be around 171,300 in the whole world
00:18:46 300 tons yes
00:18:50 there is less much less than oil
00:18:54 in only one
00:18:58 good ship that's why gold costs a lot a lot of
00:19:02 money it costs so much money if gold
00:19:06 weighs less
00:19:08 than oil from a ship of only
00:19:11 one ship
00:19:14 and well we are approaching number 10 at the end
00:19:18 the last
00:19:22 and clear of course is the diamond not
00:19:27 the diamond the largest diamond in the
00:19:32 world

075,"00:00:00 uff
00:00:02 how hot it is hot today it is
00:00:06 very hot
00:00:09 and I like it I like the heat
00:00:15 but there are places there are places where it is
00:00:20 hotter than in others not
00:00:25 today I am going to ask you 9
00:00:29 9 questions I am going to ask you between a and
00:00:36 b
00:00:38 between a and b in which it is hotter more
00:00:43 in a or more instead of which is hotter
00:00:52 [Music]
00:00:55 hello yes I am going to ask 99 questions and the
00:01:02 first
00:01:03 the first question is about the sun
00:01:08 the sun and this question is where it is
00:01:13 hotter  in the center in the center of the
00:01:18 sun
00:01:20 or on the surface in the center or on the
00:01:25 surface
00:01:27 let's see let's see let's see let you think think think well
00:01:34 and well on the surface of the sun on the
00:01:40 surface it's five thousand 500 degrees
00:01:45 5,500 degrees than the  it came and in the center
00:01:49 in the core of the sun it is 15 million 15
00:01:55 million degrees kelvin if it is much
00:01:59 more it is much more in the center yes yes
00:02:03 well this question was easy no
00:02:07 but question 2
00:02:12 question 2 where is it hottest on
00:02:17 the surface in  the surface of the sun or
00:02:22 in the corona
00:02:25 in the corona of the sun in the corona well
00:02:29 as you know on the surface it is 5500
00:02:37 5500 kelvin degrees but in the corona
00:02:42 it is 1 million
00:02:47 one million kelvin degrees yes yes
00:02:52 in the corona it is
00:02:55 warmer it is hotter than on the surface it is strange
00:03:00 no how strange
00:03:01 but hey, question number 3 where it is
00:03:06 hotter in the sun, not on the surface,
00:03:10 the surface of the sun or a fire, a
00:03:15 fire, normal fire, not the surface
00:03:19 again, five thousand five hundred and a fire,
00:03:23 I'll let you think about which one is
00:03:27 hotter in the  sun or in a
00:03:30 fire well this is also easy it is quite
00:03:34 easy a fire is between a thousand between 1000
00:03:38 and
00:03:39 5000 between 1,000 and 5,000 degrees 5000
00:03:44 I don't know I don't know if it's I don't know if it's degrees
00:03:46 Kelvin or degrees Celsius but well it
00:03:49 's very similar to these  temperatures are
00:03:52 similar so in the sun in the sun or
00:03:56 it's hotter it's hotter than on the
00:03:58 fire on the hotter fire so
00:04:02 good number 3
00:04:04 was also easy it wasn't quite
00:04:07 easy number 4 number 4 where it's
00:04:12 hotter  in u  in a fire or in a
00:04:18 nuclear reactor a reactor nuclear reactor
00:04:21 in a fire or in a
00:04:24 nuclear reactor on fire we already know
00:04:26 that it is between 1000 and 5000 no but in a
00:04:32 nuclear reactor at the maximum the maximum
00:04:35 is 800 800 degrees 800 degrees
00:04:39 Celsius let's say that  they are centigrade
00:04:43 if the maximum is 800 so in a fire
00:04:48 in a fire it's hotter hotter than
00:04:52 in a nuclear reactor it's a reactor and it
00:04:57 's not it's not a bomb it's not a
00:05:00 nuclear bomb no no not in a bomb a
00:05:05 nuclear explosion for sure  surely it's
00:05:08 hotter number 5
00:05:12 number 5 that it's hotter a
00:05:17 person
00:05:18 a person a human like you or me
00:05:22 or an elephant a person or an elephant
00:05:26 which has the hottest body well
00:05:31 a person has a body between 36 and a
00:05:36 half
00:05:38 and  37 and a half no
00:05:43 and an elephant has it at 35.9
00:05:51 very similar very similar but the
00:05:54 elephant a little less a little less yes
00:05:57 yes the elephant has a lower
00:06:00 temperature than a person this is a
00:06:04 bit of a surprise it is not a surprise
00:06:08 to see this  more  s higher
00:06:11 higher lower lower for number 6
00:06:17 6 is worth 6
00:06:21 the first is madrid
00:06:24 madrid- and the second is london which
00:06:28 is hotter in madrid the capital of
00:06:33 spain or in london the capital of
00:06:37 england the capital of the united kingdom no

00:06:50 night when it is night in winter

00:07:30 centigrade one  a little a little less than
00:07:33 london yes yes
00:07:36 this is quite surprising no but
00:07:40 what happens london london is near
00:07:44 the sea
00:07:45 here there is a sea no and madrid is very far it
00:07:49 is far from the sea no that's why in madrid

00:08:07 things to eat
00:08:11 like Roquefort for example Ford cheese

00:08:46 and it has blue blue
00:08:51 blue or green bits a certain view and it has
00:08:54 blue bits and this case a long time
00:08:59 ago a lot of stench and it smells very bad here you
00:09:03 like it  I like the statute I do
00:09:06 n't like it you don't like it I like it not very much
00:09:08 I really like blue cheese I eat it
00:09:13 and it's just that I don't normally don't like it
00:09:18 very much but one thing I do like
00:09:20 is in Thailand there is a candidate  to
00:09:24 fruit elandia not in thailand
00:09:30 velandia in malaysia thailand malaysia
00:09:32 there is a fruit a little candle a little
00:09:36 special more fruit
00:09:38 these are fruits there are no apples there are
00:09:42 apricots oranges exactly there is a
00:09:44 fruit a little special which is the tour and
00:09:47 the tour and I don't know if you know the  origin
00:09:50 is not easy to draw I'm going to try the
00:09:52 skewers all I think the feed I'm going to
00:09:54 make pizzas exactly open
00:09:56 open so it's not exact on the inside
00:09:59 and it has it's color of colors
00:10:03 [Music]
00:10:04 with yellow or white if this this is
00:10:10 yellow and for  outside it has many
00:10:13 spikes this one smells terrible spikes and
00:10:16 but I like it better I'm already in a lot of
00:10:19 pain would you like the durian the turia
00:10:22 now yes jim but the first time the
00:10:25 first goal and it smelled
00:10:29 like onion and not onion  rotten onion all
00:10:36 rotten rotten with a little worm here
00:10:39 we are eating the onion all
00:10:44 rotten here now that I'm going to be able to go to a
00:10:49 lot of plague a lot many times but
00:10:52 well now or weird if it does this but it
00:10:55 's tasty if I don't like it enough I
00:10:58 also very  well there is something else than
00:11:03 in thailand when i went to thailand
00:11:06 towards asia pests that were the rivers
00:11:10 rioja of course a river
00:11:13 river but not a clean river no no no no a
00:11:16 dirty dirty and polluted river
00:11:20 polluted clear here also in spain
00:11:23 now now less but when i  It was
00:11:26 small, there were rivers, they were very dirty,
00:11:29 very polluted,
00:11:32 and although they are quite bad,
00:11:36 I don't know how to do any other color
00:11:38 that you don't like,
00:11:41 the smell of tobacco bothers me a lot. First, the
00:11:44 tobacco net was not enough for them,
00:11:47 if it does  that this good smell I
00:11:50 like the pipe tobacco of the pipe that
00:11:53 is the tobacco that is put with the pipe
00:11:55 so this tobacco yes that I liked it smells
00:11:59 quite viable
00:12:00 but I don't like cigarette tobacco at all I
00:12:03 don't h  it smells bad
00:12:07 but pipe tobacco smells smells good,
00:12:11 do you think Carlos that it overturned smells
00:12:13 pretty good to me and if I don't know
00:12:16 it, pipe tobacco has never come
00:12:18 but there are other things that I do like
00:12:22 how they fly at level one, for example
00:12:25 at  flowers not all the flowers but
00:12:31 some smell very good there are flowers that
00:12:34 smell bad I think so some for
00:12:37 us if they are people but most
00:12:40 yes most smell good Colombian
00:12:43 what flowers and flowers are you thinking about
00:12:46 carnations carnations smell very good
00:12:49 geraniums  They don't smell very good, maybe they
00:12:52 don't make a lot of smell, plus they have
00:12:54 a bit of a strange mood. You don't like it, it's not
00:12:56 bad, but what do you like
00:12:59 how roses fly?
00:13:13 I have drawn a few roses but they
00:13:15 are still difficult to draw a
00:13:18 rose Santana Rosa smells good and let's see not
00:13:21 only not only plants for example the
00:13:24 colony the colony the colony smells good
00:13:27 to the effort put well not all of them
00:13:30 too  well there are colognes that smell bad my
00:13:34 brother my brother
00:13:36 we understand brothers my brother puts on
00:13:39 a cologne that is very strong and he has a
00:13:44 pain when my brother enters the
00:13:47 room
00:13:49 right away like this wawel is the cologne you already
00:13:53 smell cologne exactly but your
00:13:56 cologne the cologne that you  You drink
00:13:58 it, the cologne that I drink smells good,
00:14:01 problems because that's how your dogs smell
00:14:07 and what do you think of the deodorant and the
00:14:11 deodorant if it is also used so that
00:14:14 the armpit does not smell bad and then the
00:14:17 deodorant
00:14:19 in general is quite good,
00:14:26 not to me  I like deodorants that
00:14:29 smell very strong and the restaurant with
00:14:31 a very strong smell does not require a good
00:14:33 deodorant it is soft it is better it is better
00:14:36 than the smell of the armpit it smells that it
00:14:40 smells less exact that it covers it with a
00:14:43 very strong smell I do not agree with
00:14:46 what do you think of the girls man the
00:14:50 girls
00:14:53 the girls smell good it depends on the
00:14:56 girl i think i think most of the
00:14:59 girls
00:15:00 good disposes very well but the girl likes
00:15:02 it  to make it clear, that is, but when you meet,
00:15:06 you meet a girl and you smell it, it's not
00:15:09 just the smell of girls and it's not the
00:15:12 shampoo, the clothes are [ __ ], it's true,
00:15:16 you ask your friends, hey,
00:15:19 excuse me, but I can smell, I'll leave my
00:15:22 friends  and he asked them if I ask them
00:15:35 are you talking
00:15:42 and it's totally true I also think
00:15:45 there are many who don't know they don't put cologne
00:15:47 and poland very strong but they have but
00:15:50 only like shipping in the shampoo and
00:15:51 that's
00:15:53 also true and you know who comes in handy
00:15:55 who the babies to the babies
00:16:01 the babies to the head of the babies where
00:16:07 the hair the whole head of the babies
00:16:15 a little difficult a
00:16:19 lot and it comes much better from the little arm
00:16:21 graphite
00:16:25 oysters but I rather than buy a baby
00:16:28 yes I like I like to put fruit and  the
00:16:31 fruit also smells good
00:16:33 silvera to sell fruit that smells very
00:16:36 good for example if oranges and
00:16:39 citrus smell good just having a
00:16:41 bag a bag of oranges a very good
00:16:44 smell also pineapple I like it I like
00:16:47 it  come in like how the pineapple smells the
00:16:50 peach the peach will
00:16:53 also be there if it already smells a lot the grape
00:16:57 doesn't win not long ago zerolo
00:16:59 nahuel was
00:17:01 the mango and the mango
00:17:05 I don't know why I think many many
00:17:08 westerners there aren't many people  As a matter of fact,
00:17:11 from the West
00:17:13 we still like mangoes, I know, but
00:17:16 because in Europe we don't eat mangos
00:17:20 many times, one also sent more
00:17:22 often, it is a tropical fruit of course from
00:17:24 the tropical zones of the planet and in
00:17:27 Europe not
00:17:28 much our mangoes and mangoes don't.  they
00:17:31 are not very good here they are not very good
00:17:34 here many mangoes come from peru from 7
00:17:39 peru but there are also in spain but
00:17:41 many
00:17:42 and also that you know what food
00:17:48 is thinking of a food that does
00:17:52 smell like a drink that smells like you don't
00:17:55 you like it you like how the bread smells the
00:18:00 bread balance happy and from the oven of course
00:18:04 when you go to a bakery for example or
00:18:06 so you pass by and they invite you or
00:18:09 the bread man says go in that act
00:18:13 a bakery is not a store
00:18:18 one  shop
00:18:21 like this with the door a window not where they
00:18:24 sell bread they have bread bread
00:18:29 and here they have pam pam pam and you are
00:18:33 walking and you pass by and you smell
00:18:38 or well the punishments they you want to
00:18:42 enter you want to enter the
00:18:44 bakery but the bread the croissants no
00:18:49 there are reasons
00:18:53 you go out
00:18:55 I love I love the cookies the
00:18:58 cookies cookie cookies I don't know
00:19:02 how to draw chocolate cookies
00:19:03 chocolate exactly also from the oven
00:19:07 they are not in an oven
00:19:08 here heating up the cookies
00:19:11 cookie cookies cookies and you open the
00:19:13 oven it's fantastic and something else
00:19:17 from  food that those of laso for
00:19:22 my grandmother's soup adrià is not
00:19:27 always there has a father has a mother
00:19:33 I think I think around here he has his mother has
00:19:37 a father and has a mother is not there that's
00:19:41 exactly his grandmother and your grandfather asia soup
00:19:43 thinks that my grandmother  you cook well and
00:19:46 when you do that for example soup
00:19:49 soup you eat eat it with a spoon exactly
00:19:52 very well
00:19:54 this smells very good when my grandmother
00:19:55 makes clothes at home it's very good  What we
00:20:00 have the most
00:20:03 I like how I used to be when I was little I worked
00:20:10 watering the grass towards the grass
00:20:15 respect it
00:20:17 is a plant and not the grass is like a
00:20:21 very very small plant that can knock down
00:20:27 exactly I worked watering and
00:20:30 hitting with a hose Pablo watered the
00:20:35 grass when he was big  I don't know how many
00:20:37 terms I have
00:20:40 here with the blue water he is watering
00:20:45 adding light grass and
00:20:48 and I didn't mow the grass there was
00:20:50 another boy and another boy a boy
00:20:55 who mowed he cut the grass with a
00:20:57 machine and when he mows the grass he does a
00:21:01 lot of the fantastic ones and it smells like this
00:21:04 freshly cut
00:21:06 I like it very well if I have wet it is
00:21:10 fantastic if it is wet when with
00:21:12 water then it is even better
00:21:14 when it rains no yes when it rains a
00:21:17 lot on rainy days
00:21:20 when I arrive
00:21:22 when it rains all over the forest
00:21:26 places where there are plants and grass is
00:21:28 where there are trees  and trees not with
00:21:32 trunks and leaves trees trees
00:21:35 then it smells it smells different it smells
00:21:38 fantastic it becomes much more than more
00:21:41 than more than what  to the clothes when you were talking about
00:21:45 the clothes right after washing the clothes
00:21:52 [Music]
00:21:55 in the washing machine you put the clothes in very well
00:21:58 and when you take them out and when you do them those
00:22:00 clothes well first you dry them first you
00:22:03 dry them and then very well very well well

032,"00:00:00 today we are going to talk about things about things that
00:00:06 are around us
00:00:09 around us
00:00:10 there are things and how many of how many there are
00:00:15 things of which there are two there are three there are
00:00:19 four or there is only one
00:00:23 [Music]
00:00:28 hello well yes I am going to talk about how many
00:00:35 things  there are,
00:00:38 for example, eyes eyes we have two
00:00:43 we have two two eyes we don't have two two
00:00:50 eyes only you you how many
00:00:54 have three it
00:00:57 would be nice it would be nice to have
00:01:01 three eyes
00:01:04 because that way we could have 1 2 and 3 3
00:01:10 here behind and see and look back or it
00:01:16 would be fine
00:01:19 or for example we also have two two
00:01:24 arms two arms one two
00:01:29 we have two humans
00:01:33 have two arms but it would
00:01:37 be good it would be good to have four four arms
00:01:43 four arms I think it would be good
00:01:47 yes yes because now when I go shopping
00:01:52 to buy things I always have  to get
00:01:57 bills get bills
00:02:00 get coins
00:02:03 pay they give you they give you the change and the
00:02:08 change coins bills and I always
00:02:12 always
00:02:19 drop the coins yes yes that's
00:02:24 why  that I need 44 arms and 4 hands
00:02:31 there is one thing that if there are four and they
00:02:35 are wheels wheels
00:02:40 wheels in a car in a car
00:02:45 cars have four four wheels
00:02:51 and yes yes it is true that there are some
00:02:54 cars that only have three
00:02:59 three three three wheels  but it is not very good
00:03:04 because the car is very unstable it
00:03:08 can overturn if it only has three
00:03:12 three wheels
00:03:15 and there is one thing of which there is
00:03:18 only one only one and it is our sun the
00:03:24 sun
00:03:26 of sun there is only one of us here
00:03:32 on earth  On planet earth
00:03:35 we only have one sun because if
00:03:39 there were two suns, two suns,
00:03:44 buff, it would be very hot, and
00:03:49 now I'm already hot, well, with two
00:03:53 suns, I
00:03:54 would be sweating a lot,
00:03:59 like on Tatooine, on Tatooine, they have
00:04:03 two, they have two suns,
00:04:06 but there are  one thing that if there are two
00:04:10 there are 22 are not wheels
00:04:15 wheels like in the car but
00:04:18 bicycle wheels wheels on a bike on a
00:04:23 bicycle
00:04:25 a bicycle has two wheels because
00:04:30 having only one  a wheel no
00:04:36 one wheel it would be a bit strange it wouldn't be
00:04:40 very difficult but there are already there are
00:04:44 bicycles with one wheel
00:04:48 oh unicycles unicycles yes yes
00:04:52 like tony's do you remember do you remember tony
00:04:55 tony he went on a unicycle he went to france he
00:05:01 went on a unicycle he went to france
00:05:09 and there is one thing one thing of which
00:05:13 we have 55
00:05:18 5 and we people
00:05:22 have 5 of one
00:05:25 thing that we have 5 they are
00:05:32 not 2 they are not 2 no no because people
00:05:35 have 20 we have 20 20 fingers
00:05:41 we have five senses no senses
00:05:46 the senses are sight
00:05:51 hearing smell taste and touch touch 5
00:05:58 but it would be great to have more than
00:06:03 five senses and it would be great
00:06:06 we could have for example a compass
00:06:10 a compass
00:06:13 that always points north
00:06:16 that  mark
00:06:18 the north not like a compass but in the
00:06:23 head and always know how to orient
00:06:32 ourselves know where the north is the north and we could orient ourselves very well
00:06:37 and you what other senses
00:06:42 would you like that you would like to have  of
00:06:46 senses a compass or maybe have
00:06:50 x-ray vision of x-rays or what would
00:06:57 you like to have
00:07:00 tell me tell me below in the comments ok come see

00:00:05 story of a crow of course hello well
00:00:18 if this body was thirsty it
00:00:25 was thirsty it was looking for water looking for
00:00:30 water
00:00:33 water to drink
00:00:37 and found a jug
00:00:40 a jug with water
00:00:44 with water and the crow stuck its beak the
00:00:51 beak
00:00:52 the beak  He put it in the jar
00:00:57 but it didn't reach the water no no
00:01:03 so the crow looked for a stone he
00:01:08 looked for a stone a small stone
00:01:13 and he put the stone in the jar
00:01:20 and looked for another stone
00:01:24 another stone and also put it in the
00:01:28 jar and  He also put another stone in
00:01:34 and put in stone stone stone stone he
00:01:37 looked for he looked for many stones
00:01:41 and he put them in he put them in stone after
00:01:45 stone stone by stone stone he put in
00:01:48 many stones many many many
00:01:52 stones he
00:01:53 put in many stones until the water
00:01:57 the water rose rose rose rose
00:02:03 rose until  here and the crow was able to drink he was
00:02:08 able to drink the water and he was able to drink water and he
00:02:15 did not die he did not die of thirst

033,"00:00:00 Today I am going to talk about big things and
00:00:06 small things, for example, my nose, my
00:00:11 nose is very big,
00:00:15 and I am also going to talk about things that
00:00:19 when they are big, it is bad, it is bad that they
00:00:24 are very big
00:00:27 [Music],
00:00:33 good, yes, I am going to talk about small things.
00:00:37 and large, for example, an
00:00:41 ant, an ant is a small thing,
00:00:47 and an elephant, an elephant is a big thing, it
00:00:53 is very big, but there are bigger things,
00:00:57 bigger than an elephant, for
00:01:02 example, a whale, a whale,
00:01:08 a whale is bigger than an
00:01:11 elephant, and there are  things still bigger
00:01:15 than whales for example a planet
00:01:21 a planet a planet like the earth not
00:01:26 the planet earth
00:01:28 is bigger than a whale but there are
00:01:32 bigger things even bigger
00:01:37 for example a galaxy the galaxy a
00:01:42 galaxy is bigger than a planet  and
00:01:47 there are even bigger things bigger
00:01:53 wyss
00:01:55 bigger than a galaxy for example
00:01:58 your mom
00:02:01 your mom is bigger than a galaxy
00:02:06 and there are also things smaller than
00:02:10 ants more  s smaller than ants
00:02:13 for example
00:02:18 lice lice that are in the hair and
00:02:23 bite lice are smaller than
00:02:26 ants and there is still something
00:02:29 smaller smaller than a louse are bacteria
00:02:37 bacteria bacteria are smaller than
00:02:40 lice  and there is still something
00:02:44 smaller smaller than bacteria the atoms
00:02:49 the atoms
00:02:52 the atoms are smaller than the
00:02:56 bacteria and there is still one thing
00:02:59 smaller than the atoms smaller than
00:03:04 the atoms and they
00:03:08 are the hands the little hands the little hands of
00:03:13 donald trump
00:03:16 There are also things that the bigger the
00:03:20 better the bigger the better for
00:03:23 example the phones the phones yes
00:03:28 yes I believe that in 2030 in 2030
00:03:35 we will have telephones telephones I think
00:03:40 we will have 40-inch 40-inch telephones
00:03:48 yes because each time the telephones are
00:03:52 bigger more  bigger bigger
00:03:56 there are also other things that bigger
00:04:00 are better for example round things
00:04:05 anything round is better if it is
00:04:10 bigger  e yes yes yes yes no you don't believe me well
00:04:14 listen listen for example a
00:04:18 golf
00:04:20 ball a golf ball to play golf
00:04:25 to play golf a golf ball
00:04:28 is fine it's fun but a
00:04:33 soccer
00:04:35 ball a soccer
00:04:38 ball  soccer is bigger than
00:04:42 a golf ball and it's more
00:04:44 fun yes yes soccer is more fun
00:04:47 than golf and there are also
00:04:51 the Syrians you know the cereal
00:04:54 cheerios the Syrians are like that they are not
00:04:58 round and they are good they are good
00:05:03 but the donuts  donuts are better
00:05:08 if you see
00:05:12 round things round things
00:05:16 are always better if they are big
00:05:19 [Music]
00:05:21 but there are also things that the
00:05:25 smaller the better if they are small much
00:05:29 better yes yes yes for example if you are
00:05:33 swimming
00:05:34 if you are swimming  and there is a crocodile there is
00:05:38 a crocodile
00:05:40 if you are swimming and you find
00:05:44 a crocodile a small
00:05:47 crocodile a crocodile like that much better much better
00:05:50 than a big crocodile of course it is
00:05:55 also obvious the weather  rites
00:05:58 if there is a meteorite there is a
00:06:03 meteorite heading towards the earth
00:06:06 a meteorite that is going to hit the
00:06:10 earth the smaller the
00:06:13 smaller the better yes yes because if the
00:06:17 meteorite is very large we are
00:06:20 all dead the better a small meteorite
00:06:27 but there is  things that are not clear it is not
00:06:31 clear whether it is better to be
00:06:34 big or small different
00:06:38 people have different opinions
00:06:41 for example you think it is better to
00:06:46 be tall or short a person
00:06:52 a person you think is better to be
00:06:57 big or to be  small that you think
